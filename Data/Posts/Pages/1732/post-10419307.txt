Circled Dahan Hathor R1 in Raxxla Hunter with Trinkets, no luck.
You might try it at Wanderer....I keep remembering that Brookes Tour final TB quotationfrom Paradise Lost:
"And fast by, hanging in a golden chain,
This pendent World, in bigness as a star
Of smallest magnitude close by the moon"

"Wanderer" = "Vagabond" which was the last line of the toast.

I'm wondering if the Rift is very small & concealed quite close to a moon, and I think Wanderer is a good possibility. I tried searching around there when I last played but found nothing, but then I wasn't carrying Trinkets at the time.

As someone suggested recently it might also be in a crater. That would resemble the classical Omphalos Stone description but I think the likelihood is lower than orbiting a moon, purely from the need to have planetary landing capability -I can't imagine MB implementing a puzzle impossible to solve until Horizons release. The codex also has "the legend of Raxxla has been circulating, in whispers, for centuries", which I think is a strong hint that it's orbiting.
