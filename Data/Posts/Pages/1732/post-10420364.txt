I am wondering about red giant stars, though. Obviously you wouldn't need to get as close to those, and you can get some 8MGGs at reasonably plausible distances - next stop will be to check some of those out, not so much with the hope of finding it but to see if it is geometrically plausible to use one.
SPOILER: SCREENSHOT

Well, 4 Cassiopiae was nearby, so I gave it a go - I think this is a pretty good match for the Codex picture in terms of relative scales (I left my Orbis at home so had to substitute a Krait). You can see the gas giant whose 8th moon I'm orbiting would be a bit out of shot on the Codex crop. Playing with colour balances and brightness curves can match the actual picture even more closely.

This is at about 1500Ls from the red giant, and I think it would be possible to get away with being further out - maybe out to 4000Ls or so depending on the exact size of the giant star.
