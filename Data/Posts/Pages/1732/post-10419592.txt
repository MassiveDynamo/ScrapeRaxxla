Poked around the 8th gas giant moons in the in-bubble SAO systems while carrying a trinket and a SAP 8, nothing obviously there.

Looking around HIP 9369 now - it's an interesting system even if it's nothing to do with the mystery, so that's nice
All the gas giants are around a very distant secondary star and from the discovery/map record may only have ever been remote-imaged. Even with the new SCO it's going to be quite a journey.

EDIT: well, it would have been a brilliant place to hide something - far enough from the bubble that its secondary star wouldn't attract casual inspection, hidden in plain sight by a star catalogue designation mismatch, etc. but obviously there's nothing actually here that I can find round either 8th moon of a gas giant.

(As always with the Dark Wheel station, the Codex picture worries me because it seems physically implausible, but why have it there if it's not one taken from the actual station?)
