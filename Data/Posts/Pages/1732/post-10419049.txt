Where are TOHF found nowadays? I should probably pick a few up for poking around the SAO systems too.
Anarchy systems at the nav beacon. Cargo scan all traders, particularly adders, they show up once every 30 to 60 minutes (slow tedious work!!). Have plenty of recovery limpets, & be prepared for a shark feeding frenzy.
IIRC I got mine about 3 jumps from Shinrarta.

I think I have spotted a tendency for those particular cargo ships to try & bypass the circling pack of pirates in order to refuel & jump out, so I ended up aways from the pack trying to get them first.
