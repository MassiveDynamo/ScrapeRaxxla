Time to dust off v1.0 of my Raxxla theory since my doubts about its veracity have finally been quelled. By the way, I sincerely doubt this negates @PDJazzHands work. However, it may help with location of the globular cluster. @Rochester work can likely be bolted into it. Here goes nothing:


Idea was based on the ever present :
Delphi is the center point (radius) between star lovers and Raxxla. As a consequence, it can be deduced provided you have key details.
"Princess Astrophel and Spiraling Stars" was a reference to the initial publication which notably was loaded with spelling errors including the title, "Astrophil and Stella" or (star lover and star). The reference area is the Trapezium Cluster well below galactic disk.
Ursa Major is a major part of the myth and must be visible from key system related to proof it exists. So the other end of the line from Trapezium Cluster through Delphi goes somewhere in the direction of Polaris.
As a consequence of the Trapezium Cluster location, it is way up above the disk.

Complications:
Left-hand Cartesian (x, z, y) requires advanced mathematics to triangulate.
The discovery timeline angle though fuel scoops make it far less problematic.

Key points:
Sol
Delphi
center of Trapezium Cluster
Sol's true North Star (see Robigo missions)
Raxxla
