Hmm. Slight oddity - SAO 92746 is in the real-world HD 12249, which is also in-game (as HIP 9369) and well below the bubble. In-game the SAO designation is given to HIP 56685, a star which doesn't appear to have a real-life SAO designation.

The SAO/HIP/HD references match up fine for the other five.

(And of course HD 12249 in-game has two further gas giants with eight moons...)


EDIT: and another maybe-not-coincidence: from the bubble (anywhere in the bubble really, given the distances involved), the long-distance SAO 10931 is basically on the straight line to NGC 7822 with less than a degree's deviation). So the whole thing could be read as an arrow pointing to that nebula. Of course, that's one of the most explored nebulae in the game...
