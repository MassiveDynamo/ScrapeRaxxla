Mmm. Interesting, I agree SAP8 might be relevant. Have you checked the map for anything near (70/35/00) ?
I went there yesterday. There is a single system in that grid. LP 904-36
Has 8 icy planets, none landable. Ton of degraded emissions signals with blown up ships.

Logged off in the system myself as it was getting late.
Went to the degraded emissions at planet 8. Just a bunch of ship debris and some cargo/loot.

It seems a pretty busy system.
