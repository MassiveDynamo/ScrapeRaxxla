Anarchy systems at the nav beacon. Cargo scan all traders, particularly adders, they show up once every 30 to 60 minutes (slow tedious work!!). Have plenty of recovery limpets, & be prepared for a shark feeding frenzy.
IIRC I got mine about 3 jumps from Shinrarta.

I think I have spotted a tendency for those particular cargo ships to try & bypass the circling pack of pirates in order to refuel & jump out, so I ended up aways from the pack trying to get them first.
Don't forget to use hatch breakers! I found modern cargo carrier hatch armour to be far superior to military armour, however not so their hulls!!!
Time was when you targeted the hatch & shot away until it started dropping cargo........then let them fly off to collect some more from wherever they find them (I mean really, I've seen 100 TOHF in a cargo carrier! Where do they get them from?)
