I still wonder if M Brookes book -Elite Legacy, is pointing us towards the DW station?

He gives us a few locational and temporal clues to the supposed Beaumont system!

“Bring up the Beaumont insurrection from 3294.” “The Beaumont system was a frontier world far below Achenar.” “The mining base was positioned in a rich cluster in the asteroid belt around two AUs from the populated planet.”

Excerpt From Elite: Legacy Michael Brookes

One theory I’m entertaining; M Brookes talks of a mountain in some of his later blogs; I do wonder if these were theological references to the spiralling mountain of Purgatorio?

I can’t align the Dante localisms directly within game as much as I can Milton, because the two text are actually diametrically different in relation to to time and space, but there is evidence Brookes studied this text, he wrote a Drabble about it, and the theology has certain parallels, and it makes sense in game; to travel through a wood (like Gilgamesh or some Celtic Otherworld liminal boundary) to Hell / Underworld, and then find that spiralling mountain created by Satans fall, and travel up it towards Eden, as Dante and Brooke’s recount, it’s a journey everyone must take.

I am still hoping the DW station is real and in game.

My wider hypothesis is that it very much like Raxxla was part of some alternate narrative; but now archived and probably altered, but left in situ with some type of altered mechanics. I suspect the real DW faction is gone and disbanded, at least maybe its origins. The station is a relic of that period of time during the frontier and acts in game as a signpost, probably with some voice acting, giving us some major clue towards the next chapter?

I suspect we travel down below into the Underworld and are supposed to find that ‘beautiful mountain’ and some form of direction to land our path, travelling upwards along the spiralling stars.
