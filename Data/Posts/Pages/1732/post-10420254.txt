While Legacy hints that Raxxla is in Alliance space that would allow the TDW station (IF it exists) to be anywhere, and the two might be linked in MB's mythical (couldn't resist! ) "Raxxla storyline".

The hidden CIEP base- Circle of Independent Elite Pilots, an offshoot of The Dark Wheel. They used Soontill as a secret military base, so where might they have had a station?
