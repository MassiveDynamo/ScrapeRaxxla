Looked at Canonn Discord, he posted a second picture of the Orion constellation that the named stars are part. The only trouble is for been the good star mapping, the planet need to be around sol to be see like that otherwise you can't recognise them. Since they fade (hope isn't because of the sun), is mean that the system is "behind" sol when watching the constellation.

It wouldn't necessarily have to be near sol, it could be any system within a fair distance in a direct line towards or away from the constellation.
