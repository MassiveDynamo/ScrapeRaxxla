Mmm, haven’t been involved with Canonn much since they moved to Discord.

I think the three galaxies in that pic are more likely to be usable for triangulation, so not worried about the star colours being incorrect. But on Scytale’s pic the names of the upper two galaxies are cropped out, hence my interest in the source. I gather this is your hypothesis with no evidence, but would be interested in what you think are the galaxies.

Sadly, I have no idea what those 2 galaxies might be, I just marked them to call attention to them.

It's also possible that the object that I tentatively marked M42 here is actually not a part of the skybox, but a far away in-system neutron star or white dwarf - when you zoom in, it looks a little like a jet cone. Here's the closeup of the highest resolution image I could find:
