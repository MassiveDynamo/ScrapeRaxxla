I'm not sure that parallax works at all, on the sky box.

I once tried to align Sol and Ross 128, in the skybox of Van Maanen's star. I flew perpendicular to the two stars for about 0.1ly, without noticing any relative movement.

0.1ly may be to short, but the sky box may also be fixed in a system. This should be checked further, before committing significant time to tests.
The skybox is generated when you enter the system, so it never changes. However, the relative position of nearby stars *is* determined based upon your current position. I remember I once went 1 Mls+ away from Merope to look for a Voyager-like POI and I noticed that the skybox was no longer exactly in sync with the star I had targeted for my next jump!

I've done some looking for TDW station near Alliance space, on the basis that it seems to be orbiting the eighth moon of a gas giant in a very close orbit of a red-looking star, that might be K, M or a T Tauri. In fact, I suspected it might be a T Tauri, since these might be, like the L, T and Y dwarfs, considered 'dark' systems (I think Drew Wagar made the comment about brown dwarfs once in regard to finding Octavia's asteroid base from Reclamation). That's a very unusual orbital arrangement (it would be more likely to be a K star on the basis of the orbit but the appearance to me seems a closer match for a M dwarf or certain T Tauri stars). There are relatively few T Tauri stars in close proximity to the Old Worlds or just 'above' them but I found nothing. I'm now more strongly suspecting it is in a permit-locked system and you can't get the permit unless approached, hence the text of the Codex saying it's futile to go looking for them.
