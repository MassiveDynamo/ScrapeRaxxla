So i'm revisiting this station laser / logo similarity and have gone back to a couple of their stations.






That's a hinge, that thing opens, its a hydraulic arm on the end of a hinge. What does that circular ring do, do we think when they open it?

Oh and it has some of these inside it;

Just going to throw this back into the mix:

Now its broadly believed DB is meant to have said 'number stations' instead of what he actually say which was 'numbered stations'.

I'm still half of the opinion his actual intention was 'numbered' its an easy mistake to make I suppose but if you're going to leak something you'd tend to do it right....

Plus its the context in which its discussed. For instance DB is referencing another game where a clue was scattered throughout the game.

Now I wouldn't say 'number stations' correlate to that, their content that points to other content, not something hidden. 'Numbered stations' fits more into the context of a bigger mystery.

On this same note somewhere there's a FD post saying these number's on station entrances represent systems, as in where those stations are, but there was no diffinitive explanation on how those numbers related to planets etc, all I know is their all in Fed space. Probably nothing but like to get it resolved one way or the other.
