Can you please cite the source where it was "Hinted" that the other galaxies from the orginal elite are in far away regions, because I have a quote from Michael Brookes that states there is only a few systems from the original elite in this game, as shown in the game currently with the 12 or so around Lave.

I'll try to find it. The problem is that I don't remember who said it.

Far is a relative term, but all of the original Elite happened inside the Milky Way.
