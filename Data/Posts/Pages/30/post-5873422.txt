It could well be far out. As Elyssia says in The Dark Wheel: 'Raxxla—if it exists—is in another Galaxy'.

The 'other galaxies' in Elite have been hinted by FD to be far away regions inside the Milky Way. These regions were connected by 'something' that made it possible to jump between them, using the galactic hyper drive. This 'something' collapsed and the galactic hyper drive became obsolete.

Can you please cite the source where it was "Hinted" that the other galaxies from the orginal elite are in far away regions, because I have a quote from Michael Brookes that states there is only a few systems from the original elite in this game, as shown in the game currently with the 12 or so around Lave.
