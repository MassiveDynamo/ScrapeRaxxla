Jason probably never found Raxxla. He found evidence of it's existence and was gathering a search party, when he was killed.

Important bit:
'Jason Ryder was convinced that Raxxla existed. That's why he trained for, and became a part of, the Dark Wheel, the legend-seekers. I hadn't heard much from him or about him for some time until just before he died, when he told me he'd found evidence for the real existence of Raxxla. He came back from Deep Space to get a proper team together… ' Rafe smiled bitterly. 'But just before he was due to go back, he decided to take a safe-worlds holiday jaunt with his son… and an assassin was waiting for him.'

Hmm.. i read that as meaning he could reach it within a reasonable amount of time.

What's the maximum someone could have traveled back then in say 10 years with a decent sized ship (to include provisions and stuff for all that time?).

Ugh... i'm also too oriented on Frontier with its failures when you jumped too far. Dang, should be thinking in terms of original Elite lore. 8 galaxies sort of thing.
