Yeah the 8 "Galaxies" were not True Galaxies so it would all have to be in the milky way. I'm just curious because I think Rain was a system in the old Elite and that is also in the bubble but it was in a different galaxy then Lave, Reorte, etc etc. Also I kinda though you were implying that the other galaxies were in this game hence the Michael Brooks quoted link I supplied.
