The fact that Jason found it and returned within presumably what was no more than a few years indicates it might even be within the bubble considering the travel times back then.

Hopefully I've covered this with other replies!

It could well be far out. As Elyssia says in The Dark Wheel: 'Raxxla—if it exists—is in another Galaxy'.

The 'other galaxies' in Elite have been hinted by FD to be far away regions inside the Milky Way. These regions were connected by 'something' that made it possible to jump between them, using the galactic hyper drive. This 'something' collapsed and the galactic hyper drive became obsolete.

Yep, that's the root of a lot of what I was saying!
