Hmm.. i read that as meaning he could reach it within a reasonable amount of time.

What's the maximum someone could have traveled back then in say 10 years with a decent sized ship (to include provisions and stuff for all that time?).

Ugh... i'm also too oriented on Frontier with its failures when you jumped too far. Dang, should be thinking in terms of original Elite lore. 8 galaxies sort of thing.

I've not looked at an estimate for type 0 drives yet, but have a look at the spoiler in my previous post for an estimate of distances achievable in a week for a type 1 drive.

Type 0 had similar jump times, but the max range is unclear. It's at least the distance from Lave to Leesti but I can't check what that is right at the moment.

There was extra pre-jump work needed for type 0, so the inter-jump step would be longer than for type 1.

Also, just to cover the need to use the faraway jump network - the MB interview makes it pretty clear that it's effectively a public mass transit system and that some people had a more pioneering approach.

Also, pure speculation here on my part, but the Dark Wheel may possibly have had access to better jump tech than the run-of-the-mill stuff that was in public use. Could be wrong of course, but it's worth considering.
