Hi Thatchinho
Not disagreeing with you, but can you tell me where we are told that it's a long distance away? (Because that implies a clue and DB said no clues).

And why do you say jump drive technology had taken a massive step backwards?
It's the quote from Elyssia fields that Han Zen mentioned coupled with the hinted retcon of the intergalactic jumps to long distance intragalactic.

As to why do I say drives took a step backwards, several reasons (I'm talking about the loss of the type 1 (Quirium fuelled) tech btw:

a. Galactic hyperdrive capabilities were lost

b. Reliability and jump distance were improved but jump time went from a couple of seconds to days or weeks, which gives a net result of vastly decreased distances which could be covered. (And I don't use the word vastly lightly, I've done the workings - spoilered below).

c. Drew's lore page says it! (Well specifically it says "hyperspace capabilities regressed somewhat" at the time in question, though I don't know if there would have been the maths behind it to say how much things has regressed.)

Anyway the maths (open to critique, obviously! ):
