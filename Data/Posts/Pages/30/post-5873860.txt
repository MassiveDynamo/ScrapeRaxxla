Two things to remember:
1 David Braben and other frontier higher ups did confirm raxxla was in the game.
2 Raxxla is a planet, planets dont show up in the search bar but some systems have named planets but not all of these systems named every planet.


I would recomend to scan every system you come across in the bubble and scan search buy every peace of mapping you can and look at every planet if there is a planet named raxxla.


PS Unconfirmed Rumours have it that you can only find it when tripple elite.
