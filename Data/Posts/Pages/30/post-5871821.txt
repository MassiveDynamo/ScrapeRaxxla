It could well be far out. As Elyssia says in The Dark Wheel: 'Raxxla—if it exists—is in another Galaxy'.

The 'other galaxies' in Elite have been hinted by FD to be far away regions inside the Milky Way. These regions were connected by 'something' that made it possible to jump between them, using the galactic hyper drive. This 'something' collapsed and the galactic hyper drive became obsolete.

You have to remember that the Dark Wheel accompanied the original game back when 8 bit addressing was used, so the game couldn't directly access the whole space & extra galaxies was the lore way of explaining that & the "galactic drive" was the paging mechanism. So you may be correct in that far away regions of ED galaxy are implied. I believe FD have also said there is only one galaxy in ED.

Also this is a different game, with a strong relationship to the original but I don't think the range limitations of previous generations of fsd can be relied upon as a guide to the location of Raxxla in ED.
