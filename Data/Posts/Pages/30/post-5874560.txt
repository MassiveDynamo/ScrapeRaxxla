Two things to remember:
1 David Braben and other frontier higher ups did confirm raxxla was in the game.
2 Raxxla is a planet, planets dont show up in the search bar but some systems have named planets but not all of these systems named every planet.


I would recomend to scan every system you come across in the bubble and scan search buy every peace of mapping you can and look at every planet if there is a planet named raxxla.


PS Unconfirmed Rumours have it that you can only find it when tripple elite.

Since nobody has found it yet, and FD have said no clues, then any requirement for triple Elite is pure speculation.

edit: and since Raxxla apparently wasn't actually in the first game then I think any lore-based interpretation of its wherabouts is suspect!
Since there is only one galaxy in ED, according to FD, then when/if its found it cant have an alien gateway to other galaxies; possibly a used spaceship salesroom?
