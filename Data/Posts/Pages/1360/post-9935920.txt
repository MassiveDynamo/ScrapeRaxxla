oo, would have been nice to empty his hold.
I am only selling to stations in qty of 16, to see if there is ever any reaction that is useful.
but my main concern is seeing if they ever do anything useful...I wish I could hang them from the rearview....o, no rearview...dumb ship.

I have no plans for ever going below 16 in storage, hundreds would make this easier.
