The strange loss of your FSD supercharge, was that a one time thing or does it always happen? I’ll switch to my long range jumpaconda and take a look myself if you still think there is something of interest. I was recently sent back to Jameson by an unfortunate goid hyperdiction so I have my choice of vessels at the moment.
I think its the first time its ever happened to me. Once supercharged it normally stays with the ship until an fsd jump. Though the inability to use the supercharge isn’t, that does happen on occasions but usually I can clear it by changing the settings in the galmap, clearing & replotting the route.

I intend to retry Beta Hydrae, this time with some Trinkets in the hold. In particular I want to retry the comet search method, because that failing (to fail & crash the game) was the one thing that really raised my eyebrows.

I started in Horizons then switched to Odyssey. With updates now only apparently happening to EDO I will maybe try both again; I much prefer the graphics in Horizons.
