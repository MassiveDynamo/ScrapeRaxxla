Lol, I did have a theory once about trying to do a self destruction just as your FSD is kicking in, like literally just before it locks your view straight Forward, or if it was possible, while already in the hyperspace tunnel, and see what happens.... lmao XD but never attempted... figured youd load into white nothingness of Raxxla... XD XD
Iv done that, turns out it doesnt actually let you self destruct while engaging fsd
