Though I will say, I like that I got a conversation going again, last few weeks been kinda quite with just small bursts of light comments lol....

But if someone can give me evidence that Polaris is hiding somthing to do with DW/Raxxla, im more than willing to listen, but so far there isn't ANY that I'm aware of point us to Polairs for this story arch...

There's evidence of Polaris having Thargoid history/connections, but not DW/raxxla... (and yes I get it, DW/raxxla and thargoids could also be connected, blah blah blah, show me some hard proof of that, not just conjecture)
