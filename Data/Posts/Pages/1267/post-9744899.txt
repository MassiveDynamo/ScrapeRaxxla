I also have another theory that involves dying, but just as an means to start....

I wonder, and I dont think it's been done...

What would happen if a CMDR, never left the Permit locked Pilots Federation worlds?
And got to Elite, maybe double elite, trade and exploration .... although I don't think exploration would be possible to achieve in those confined systems tbh.... but trade should be in theory, it would just take forever....

And if you never left or get kicked out, and got elite, what would happen?
Would you still get the Elite permits?

I doubt it would involve Raxxla, If it did people would be furious those systems didnt exist only until recently
