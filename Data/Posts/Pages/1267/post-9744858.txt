Also, lmao...

I said "unlimited range FSD booster-field thinggggy"

This lol is unfortunately not even that much if a stretch to think is really real in game.

We know our ships can explode anywhere and we 'escape' in our remlocks/escape pods...
But our physical bodies, can go from beyond Begal Point, all the way back to Sol, in a nearly instant.... which would mean that lore wise, we have sort of, unlimited range FSD, they must just be very limited to minimal weight, and likely organics of some kind, ect, as we can't even take scan data, just our bodies...

But there's potential in the lore for that tech, to have been stolen/reverse engineered from once found, deciphered, and used, Raxxla or potentially, Guardian tech... And that original tech could have/be much more powerful and capable
