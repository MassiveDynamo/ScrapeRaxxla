I doubt it would involve Raxxla, If it did people would be furious those systems didnt exist only until recently
Trueeeeee......

Wasn't thinking...

I hate that I didn't know about ED when it launched, it's hard to always remind myself of what was available at launch vs now, when I didn't even know about elite until Beyond pushed out, and even then was more just watching a buddy play from time to time, I didn't even buy the game till Horizons when you could land on surfaces, lmaoo (then i bought on xbox and PC, lmaoo, i love me some VR)... but man oh man since then.... information overload lmaooo....

Someone needs to write the encyclopedia of elite dangerous one day XD XD...
