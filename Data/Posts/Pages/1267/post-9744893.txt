Maybe Raxxla is only found by dying over and over again where finally the game realizes this guy dies so much lets show him the way.....
Lol, I did have a theory once about trying to do a self destruction just as your FSD is kicking in, like literally just before it locks your view straight Forward, or if it was possible, while already in the hyperspace tunnel, and see what happens.... lmao XD but never attempted... figured youd load into white nothingness of Raxxla... XD XD
