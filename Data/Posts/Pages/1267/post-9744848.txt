If Raxxla can indeed move/change systems/travels on a route through systems....

And if Raxxla is a 'device/station/portal/' , with the possible ability/power/portal to send you anywhere in the MilkyWay galaxy, basically unlimited range FSD booster-field thinggggy ....


Couldn't then the timeline for discovery of Raxxla/the earliest record of Raxxla, then mean it could be much further away from the rough 200ly bubble being searched by most ppl?

If we have a 200 year and 200ly bubble now, it could stand to reason that Raxxla was 'discovered', somewhere on its Travels/path thru the galaxy, when it was closer to Sol/the bubble, very early in the days of human expansion, but then it moved, and began getting farther and farther away, and could have been well more than 200ly away, easily, by the first recording of its existence, and anyone who has been there, stayed there, found it again since, was able to return to the "Sol bubble" using its powers, but by the time they can travel back in normal space to it to use it again, it's moved....?

Ideas? Comments? Long running theory I've been noodling along side others lol
