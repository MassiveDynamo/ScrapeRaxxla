Perhaps Raxxla was found and they have been using it to FSD our escape pods home being we are the Elite CMDR's of the Pilots Fed//Dark Wheel Associates
Exactly, maybe the whomever, use Raxxla's powers for our instant communication and escape systems, but thats all they really can do right now, and they hold the location secret because it both moves, and is the source of all of humanities ability to be "safe" and have access to information and communication while traversing the galaxy, and if people, like the winking cat or others, messed with it in anyway, we could loose everything forever or like, once somthing as large as a ship uses it, it's permanently set for large things like ships, and communication breaks or somthing.... who know... needs more work XD
