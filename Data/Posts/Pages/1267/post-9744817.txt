My point entirely, discussion is important and can get things moving when they get stale.

Critical thinking is good. All theories here are viable, in my opinion.

To entertain the possibility that Raxxla / DW is either not in game or not accessible or is narratively locked is not, in my opinion a limited perspective towards finding them.

It is only limited if one is fixed upon only 1 theory, one has to entertain multiple theories, then weight them up against each other.

Firstly acknowledging our own limitations and challenging bias enables us to widen our understanding and perspective. It’s not meant to be an argument, it’s a scientific principle.

Secondly entertaining such theories, challenging them, retesting them, from time to time can allow us to see intelligence gaps.

Intelligence gaps are valuable, because it can not only assist us to refocus our resources better; but it can also identify hidden behavioural attributes, which normally can not be seen and make projections as to ‘where it will / may be’ in the future, or even discover other elements unlinked but likewise hidden from general view.
