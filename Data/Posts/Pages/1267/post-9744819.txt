Is a link to Drew saying in no uncertain terms, Raxxla is IN GAME and fdev knows where it is.
Point blank.

Sure this could mean just a reference to the codex entry, but look at Drews face and listen to his tone. He whole-heartedly believes it exists ingame in some accessible format.

i really dont think hed have been allowed to walk away from that conversation believing that if it wasnt true. He was a close friend and I doubt they'd lied flat out to him.


Anyways, all conjecture, let's move on with our assumptions again XD in Polaris not in Polaris, until someone gets into Polaris, next topic please

I have always thought of this...what if the "We" didnt mean Fdev at all and was some sort of riddle, They obviously said this to drew for a reason, as one of the most known and watched Elite fans/players at the time and still currently I doubt they would have said this to him out of ignorance, or they just used him for marketing more than his storyline input (Most likely this)
