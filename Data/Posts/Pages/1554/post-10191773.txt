How apt… just arrived when I got back into dock…

The layout of various chapters, I have to say looks very much like another familiar text…

I really suspect this had an influence as source material for the constitution the codex…

‘Much like the ancient myths of Atlantis, El Dorado and the kingdom of Prester John’…

Do you have the book? Starting on Page 106 (107 it topped with FUTURE mirrored) is a section that I swear desribes the Raxxla myth and possibly the system in vivid detail. Most of these books had a end-chapter reminscient of the Raxxla myth. This was far from the only one. I went through a great deal of trouble to acquire all of them written between Holdstock and Malcolm Edwards plus the few written under the alias Steven Eisler.
