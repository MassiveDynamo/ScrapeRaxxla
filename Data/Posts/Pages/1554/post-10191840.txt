I highly recommend this if you can find a copy… there’s free press version abound but I got hold of a physical copy.

The Astronomy of Paradise Lost by Thomas N Orchard MD, p 1913.

A lot of it’s science is obviously out of date, but it actually interprets Milton’s abstract concepts rather brilliantly, one could go so far as describing Paradise Lost as the first sci-fi book, before Mary Shelly, in the way that Milton describes his model universe and the cosmological journey of Lucifer, from that perspective it’s astonishing for the time, for its abstractions and metaphysics!

I read Milton at school which was a dull affair, concerning mostly on the religious / moral aspects. Yet Milton’s world building didn’t really hit me when I looked at it from the perspective of astronomy - thanks in part to Micheal Brookes O7.

With great wealth comes great responsibility to share it. You can thank The University of Toronto and The Internet Archive and some wicked Elder Millennial Google-fu.
