I do believe we’re very close. FD has given us a big clue here. The system Artemis is not simply chosen because it already represented Brookes. His book Legacy has some unique elements which bring attention to ‘the triad’. The codex to I believe pulls us in the same direction. But I suspect Brookes was inspired by a collection of ideas, especially Holdstock.

‘Lost Realms’ by Holdstock is essentially IMOP the underworld area in game near Axis Mundi literally spelt out… many of the lands in that book are there, and I believe the codex point there too… it’s essentially a big Holdstock Easter egg.

I’m still pulling various concepts together but I may try and present something- don’t believe it will lead anywhere but it might establish certain hypothesis.
