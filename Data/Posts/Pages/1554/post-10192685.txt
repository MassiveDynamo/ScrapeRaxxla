Finally got to the last beacon, works been hectic and yes i admit i lost my old route notes on how to get here!
Thought the beacon descriptions were really well written, just need to look close and see what clues they may hold (if any).
Will grab a few beers at the Tourist Centre and head back to look more into Galactic Tours tomorrow (well actually today now).
