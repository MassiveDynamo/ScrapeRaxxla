Hi, I don't typically dabble in Raxxla discussion but I made note of this in the Cannon discord.

The lines from Paradise Lost:

"And fast by, hanging in a golden chain,
This pendent world, in bigness as a star
Of smallest magnitude, close by the moon."

refer to the Earth.
You realize that Lave proves Sol has always been in the lore from the beginning even though someone (probably Walden tries to erase it from the map in the first game). The TDW novella has tons of Earth references.

Lavian Brandy
A highly valued liquor from the old world of Lave. Using ancient breeds of grains grown in its tropical climate under a permit from the government, the distillate is kept in old Earth oak barrels and held in an orbital maturing facility for decades to achieve maximum richness.

This rare good is legal in all systems except for Prison Colony systems and Federal and Alliance Theocracy systems.
