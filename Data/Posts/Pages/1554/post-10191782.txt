Of smallest magnitude, close by the moon."

fits Lucifer also, smallest magnitude star being the white dwarf, Lucifer is only 0.0500 earth masses (pendent size) also, Planets been wrapped by coils since 2350 and exploited for synthesis of "custom elements" for Military grade fuel which is what was or still is need for older type jump drives and capital ships, What if these coils are harnessing something different from a seedier cabal like Sirius is and has been known as I mean nothing much difference between Lucifer and lets say most other high metal planets

also Lucifer reference to the post above "Satan is able to see Earth through a gold chain hanging from heaven" I may target earth and travel in its direction from Lucifer and see if anything pops up and if the golden chain references a line that must be travelled

If the "FUTURE" section of "Lost Realms: An Illustrated Exploration of the lands behind the legends" is at all relevant we are looking for a 9 planet system with an Earth-like. I think Sol is just the place that proves Raxxla is legit but we are looking for a system with exactly 9 planets and something special buried within. Sol, was just the place where humanity originated but also where we were able to rebuild Talmor Lens when it was misbuilt. Sol is important to Raxxla but it isn't itself Raxxla, if I understand it correctly.
