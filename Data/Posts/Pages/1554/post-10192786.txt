Is there anything in your view that connects PL to Orion?
Sadly no I could not make any meaningful links. Orion does pop up once in Paradise Lost, but only metaphorically in conveying a tempest or storm. That constellation seemingly had no other import other than to convey maybe the seasonal weather?

‘When with fierce winds Orion armed Hath vexed the Red Sea coast, whose waves o’erthew Busiris and his Memphis chivalry’ John Milton.

Busiris, was Greek myth, the Egyptian king and son of Poseidon and of Lysianassa.

Other than that I could not find a meaningful link. I didn’t believe it had any other relevance other than convey a storm or tempest?

IMHO the constellations existed within the Crystalline shell (the orb hanging from the chain). And we’re used by Milton to describe either the periods of the year (weather) or known points in the sky, such as with the journey of Lucifer when he descended into our universe, as he traveled in an oblique angle.

His vantage point could possibly be accessed by acknowledging which constellations he saw, from his initial vantage point, which is described in the book. As to if Brookes followed Milton ‘academically’, is anyone’s guess but I presume not.
