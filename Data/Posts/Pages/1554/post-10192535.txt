This Pendent World

‘Cosmos and Character in Paradise Lost’, by Malabika Sarkar

This is a very good description and explanation of the abstract nature of this particular text.

Seeing a lot of interpretations flying about trying to apply simplistic examples to fix this in game. The reality is it could be far simpler and in my opinion more in line with either the original text, or it’s been abstracted further in line with Brookes other influences…

It’s worth noting that Milton sometimes utilised practical ‘for the time’ descriptions to convey vast unknown distances, but these are interchangeable, at some points these seem smaller than corresponding larger entities and visa-versa, the point was not to be so scientifically accurate, but to convey an aspect of cosmological wonder and of dimensions outside our (then) comprehension which might defy description, or dimensions which were at that time considered vast and measured and understood, or comparable.

Example - celestial beings are noted as being enormous yet mutable, and unknown yet physical, matter may be an entity (eg Chaos is both an entity but also not).

My point being one cannot simply apply logic to this text, it is very much a work of creative and imaginative abstraction.

Also many of the allusions meant something completely different during that period; when referring to something it may be an allusion to something classical (Greek) or a feeling (the colour black had various meanings not all of them negative) and of course a great deal of the text was metaphorical, referring to political aspects apparent during that period.

For instance demons were described to fly like bees - an in joke about the church….

Fascinating…

Good points. And we have to remember that it’s FD’s understanding of the text that matters, in the game. They may have their own spinn on the story.
