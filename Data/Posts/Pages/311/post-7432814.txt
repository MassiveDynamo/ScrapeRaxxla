Thargoid attacks are completely different subject. We don’t know how they choose to Infest a system, I can tell you that they are not choosing only the populated systems and they are not attacking small/medium stations nor surface installations.

They are searching for something, not necessarily a thing, unlikely, they are not leaving unless they are repelled and they sometimes come back to previously attacked systems to re-infest. I can safely assume they are not searching for a device, Raxxla, artificial object for that reasons.

UA (now TS, Thargoid Sensor) bombing was a different thing. Its corrosive nature could damage the starports when they were in high quantities in that particular starport. Both players and NPC’s were able to do that, there was one recent tech that allowed starports to endure much more corrosive damage but I’m not sure if it’s still possible to shut down a starport by selling mass quantities of TS’s.
