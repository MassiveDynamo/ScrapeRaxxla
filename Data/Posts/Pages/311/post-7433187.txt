Found something odd looking for NGC to explore. I've decided my mission in life is to explore NGC completely! 8)

NGC 1245. It even has an odd star that has a name with GEN#... It's potentially unreachable. Unless someone knows how to it. It's odd enough to potentially be of interest in any odd searchs. I couldn't find anything in a google search on it. Is this potentially of interest or just some dev spot to make stars?!

I'm assuming this is not in the correct place yet. It should be a part of the perseus constellation! Isn't perseus related to the mysteries somehow?

Can you please define unreachable?
