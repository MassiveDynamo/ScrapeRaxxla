there was one recent tech that allowed starports to endure much more corrosive damage but I’m not sure if it’s still possible to shut down a starport by selling mass quantities of TS’s.
Meta-alloys were used to nullify UA bombing effects. FDEV removed the ability to UA bomb recently, lore explanation being in the veins of folk having found a way to negate the effect on large scale, so the countermeasures are in place aready everywhere.
