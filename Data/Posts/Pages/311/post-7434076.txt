There has been some discussion over DB’s “number/numbered stations”, the fact that Fed stations are all numbered, the appearance of front & rear ovarious stations...
Should we set up a database of stations with name, number, front & rear pictures, and how could it be hosted?

Maybe just a Google Sheets spreadsheet?
