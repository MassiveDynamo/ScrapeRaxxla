I think it's too far to jump too. It's directly below the line between the sector heart and soul are in but so far down there is no way to make it as far as I can tell. Put in NGC 1245 into your search in game and it will take you too it.

Is this the wrong direction for raxxla?

Wiki says it should be in the perseus constelation. But I don't think that is where that is located. From that thread I'm in the area it should be just near california nebula.
