It's probably wrong way, but I want to share it. I googled some time ago. Looked for siren of the void. No any special mystical creatures. But I found musicians who named Hydra Coil. And that have the composition Void Siren. After it I checked both constellations using eddb. I mean Hydra and Hydrus. First one is nothing I think. But second have permit locked system. Alpha Hydri. This system even haven't any info about bodies. 71 ly from Sol is not barrier for the true explorer. So it was locked since release. Pilot Federation permit.
