ah, but DW in SD are still in business therefore, according to Felicity, they must be the real deal; but not necessarily anywhere near the inner circle -they’re just “spinning on the outer rim”! (Elite Premonition)

actually maybe they want thrumpberry juice deliveries!

Whatever the exact relation to TDW the SD faction has they must be sanctioned by the real dark wheel. My money is on a deliberate distraction (another separate faction allowed to use the name with no real connection to TRDW) to keep the keep the unworthy away from the real Dark Wheel and their plans.
