Is there an authoritative chronological list of the first systems colonized?

I've found some colonization info in the ED Timeline: https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Elite_Dangerous_Timeline.
But apparently some of that timeline is from earlier versions of the game, so I don't know how much is canon for ED!

@Comandante ”Alpha Centauri (failed colony before Tau Ceti)” - that’s interesting! First I’d heard of it! where’s the source & is it canon for ED?

Long ago my “Paradise Lost hypothesis” ended in Alpha Cent......didn't find anything though, but that doesn't mean there’s s nothing to find!

@Rochester : you’re more knowledgeable than I on Milton. I had assumed in that hypothesis that Alpha Cent/Eden was the end of the “personal journey”, but maybe it was the beginning? So what does Milton say about Adam & Eve’s expulsion form Eden & their subsequent “personal journey”?

Good news is that I’ve now decorated the hallway in preparation for xmas visitors, so I might be able to fly again soon; bad news is ...I’ve got xmas visitors!
