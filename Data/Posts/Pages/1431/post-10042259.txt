Then you may want to revise your previous post, which implied you were listing them in order. Or disappear off to Shinrarta Dezra? I hear its lovely this time of year.

Tau Ceti, Delta Pavonis, Beta Hydri and Altair were the first systems colonised (in that order). I believe there is some documentation available on the Taylor Rebellion here.

This is correct.
This was merely a first pass to get a reasonably complete list. Though, your mentioning of Shinrarta Dezra is interesting given the whole Founder's World bit. That angle needs to be checked probably against its' neighbors to see if between Shinrarta Dezra beacons and neighbors we get even an approximate settled date.
