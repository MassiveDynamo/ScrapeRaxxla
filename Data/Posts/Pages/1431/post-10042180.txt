The source for most of this is the Frontier: Elite II - Gazetteer: http://www.dream-ware.co.uk/frontier/books/gazetteer/

As far as I know, this was used as a basis for ED history as well. The timeline in ED has had only minor adjustments compared to this one.

The original list is a combination of real stars and proceduraly generated systems. It was added to give flavour to the galaxy and a bit of background to the systems mentioned in Stories Of Life On The Frontier.

Not all the procedurally generated systems were included in ED.

More details of the past are continually added to the game. Tourist beacons, Galnets "History of ---" articles and the Codex are safe bets for accurate details.

The past of the ED galaxy is constantly evolving. Sometimes it changes and other times, in conflict with it self.
