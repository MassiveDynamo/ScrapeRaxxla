Just a quick one from you seasoned hunters if you please.
Regarding the much discussed generation ships do we know when the first mention of the Raxxla Toast was?
The Alleged Toast is as far as I know undated. The Raxxla Codex states that journal from Art Tornvquist (ship board mechanic based out of Tau Ceti) is dated 2296. This was the first written mention of the rumor which likely predates the journal. There is mention of a pirate cache in connection to it. That said, it might be a good idea to check about 20 LY range surrounding the in-game pirate cache located nearby where we got permit for HIP 22460 (was a single jump away) - see https://canonn.science/codex/pirate-cache/ .

Hope that helps.
