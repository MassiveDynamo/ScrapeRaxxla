Is there an authoritative chronological list of the first systems colonized?

I've found some colonization info in the ED Timeline: https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Elite_Dangerous_Timeline.
I'll add. Most of that timeline around the early colonisation period is, with a few amendments, from material I wrote.

I didn't say there were 70,000 generation ships, for example.
