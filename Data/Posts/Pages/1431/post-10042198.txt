That list is not in order.
I am aware. I used the Frontier gazetteer to get the current Universal Cartographics names for the systems. There's also the matter that some of them (e.g. Phekda) are settled later because they had a long uneventful generation ship ride. I gave up on doing perfect even alphabetical ordering after a bit. It is meant to be the more lore important of the early colonies. I also need to do another pass at it and see if Jackson's Lighthouse had an older name since it used to be inhabited at least per in-game description. Truthfully, reading the manual for Frontier and First Encounters might even produce a longer list.

Note: A great deal have maintained names through the series but others have seen fairly significant upheaval.
