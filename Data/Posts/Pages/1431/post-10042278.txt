Sources based on Tourist beacons such as https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Elite_Dangerous_Timeline#cite_note-TB0167-6 looks legit.
TB167 just says Tau Ceti was the first colony. Just searched the TB spreadsheet and only mention of Alpha Centauri I can see was about the Hutton Orbital Mug:

It’s @Comandante ’s “Alpha Centauri (failed colony before Tau Ceti)” that interests me. What is the source for that “failed colony before Tau Ceti”?

It would make sense in physical terms-it is the nearest system to Sol, so logically should have been visited/settled first, but I’m not aware of any ED lore that says so (which in itself is interesting!) @Allen Stroud : care to comment on this Allen?
