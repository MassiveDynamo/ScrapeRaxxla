But apparently some of that timeline is from earlier versions of the game, so I don't know how much is canon for ED!

@Comandante ”Alpha Centauri (failed colony before Tau Ceti)” - that’s interesting! First I’d heard of it, where’s the source & is it canon for ED?

Long ago my “Paradise Lost” hypothesis ended in Alpha Cent......didn't find anything though, but that doesn't mean there’s s nothing to find!
Sources based on Tourist beacons such as https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Elite_Dangerous_Timeline#cite_note-TB0167-6 looks legit.
