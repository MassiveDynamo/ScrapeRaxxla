This was merely a first pass to get a reasonably complete list. Though, your mentioning of Shinrarta Dezra is interesting given the whole Founder's World bit. That angle needs to be checked probably against its' neighbors to see if between Shinrarta Dezra beacons and neighbors we get even an approximate settled date.
My mention was a light touche to your mention last time I posted, nothing more.
