Anyone going to the Cone Sector with Cannon?

I'm going there for a holiday. Time to spend some of that hard-earned bounty hunting money. Lounge bars, casino, fluffy Thargoid memorabilia. I wonder what gravity they have in the swimming pool department? Certainly wouldn't expect anything dangerous happening there.
