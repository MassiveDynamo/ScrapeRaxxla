A small population you say? Perhaps small enough to fit with the expected number of Elite retirees, hmmm? I'm not saying it's Raxxla, but...

No indeed. I think since Canonn’s megaship is the only means of reaching that area, & with the amount of salt farmed on FD/ Canonn/ and the nonsensical assumed special relationship between them, there is zero probability of Raxxla being in the Cone Sector . However it wouldn’t at all surprise me if Gnosis reaching that area was to be the trigger for the floodgates coming down and the real Thargoid invasion (Oresrian) to start. And there could be a finite possibility that she may not survive a “welcoming” party.

I listened to the DJTruthsayer livestream bit on Raxxla (starts around 1hour 45) and it is indeed only his pet theory that Raxxla lies within 1000ly of the bubble, based on the hypothesis that it was found early on in the Elite timeline when jump distances were much shorter; however how much of that timeline has FD retconned? Do we now have any definitive statement about Raxxla that we can consider lore? I thought the original Dark Wheel novella itself had also been retconned into “non history”? His pet theory requires triple Elite status, but there was no reason given for that (at present I am only 1hour 50 into it).

I think the small population story arose a while ago & there was no corroboration? If it was originally there it may have been retconned out in the storyline rewrite that FD appear to have done; the Cone Sector was originally accessible & was partially explored back around 1.0, don’t know when the permit locks were applied around there.
