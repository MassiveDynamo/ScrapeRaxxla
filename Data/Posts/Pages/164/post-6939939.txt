Interesting...what makes us think there's a base out there?

Not 100% sure, but AFAIK, a small population ~2,500 was showing in the system info a while back. Given the distance, it would I guess it would have made an asteroid base the most likely candidate.

I don’t think there’s a population shown any more, but could be wrong.

Regardless, the permit lock setup means that the area has been accessible in general (via mega ships) but not to independent pilots, which makes it interesting enough for me in its own right.
