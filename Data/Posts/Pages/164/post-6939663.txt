Anyone going to the Cone Sector with Cannon?

It may well contain Raxxla, and I don't currently have any better theories so I'm off to take my search there.

Yep. I've left my Epsilon Orionis hangout (which is beneath the permit lock sectors sureounding the Cone Sector.), and am doing a bit of exploring of the edges of the permit locks while waiting for the Gnosis to make it's way over.

Seriously doubt Raxxla's going to be in there, but there's rumoured to be a small human settlement of some kind (asteroid base maybe), and I'm intrigued to see if there's anything to indicate why the surrounding permit locks were put in place, and who by.
