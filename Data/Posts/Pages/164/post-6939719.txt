Is it too late to join the Gnosis now? I didn't get a chance to head over when I first saw the news drop.

Also, as my PC commander is MIA currently, I'd only be able to do it with my PS4 commander (who is still in the bubble). Does the Gnosis exist in the PS4 universe?

Still plenty of time to join AFAIK. Here's a link to the thread with the schedule:

Can't say for definite, but am pretty sure you'll be fine on PS4. Might be worth double checking in the main thread just in case.
