yes, today I finally read a list of most of the things that players have done to find the answer to this question. it was a very long way... blind. Several volumes of books can be written there. ready script for a whole season of star trek

I did not find anything in Shinrarta .. except for the merchant ARIEL who suddenly appeared under the auspices of the Dark Wheel, but there is no mysticism here, he always appears in the system if you has been in system for a long time. They also said that tip off missions are disabled, but today such a mission came to kill a pirate lord in a neighboring system.

now I'm trying to build a logical chain into the codex, where the first paragraph with Tau Ceti is the beginning of the route and how the path should be traversed for each paragraph. but for some reason I can’t find the gamma of Cassiopeia (aka Navi) through the map. although this is the brightest of the five navigational jewels of Cassiopeia, but for some reason the star cannot be found through the map, strange
