I made an image showing different stages of the ghosts in Alpha Cygni's sysmap:

SPOILER

The first images are of the upper right ghost, then both, lower left ghost and both again. When only one is in the image, it's because the other isn't visible. This is about 30 min of changes. All images are at max zoom in the map, at real size.
curious. How does FD comment on this? supernova explosion?
