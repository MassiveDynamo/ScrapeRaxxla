Well I know I certainly reported it…

Just checked your link but that issue was unsupported, so by their “issue burying process” it would have been totally ignored. I think it needs at least 4 supporters before they’ll even start to consider looking at an issue! This is one of my biggest gripes with FD!

I’ve just tried to log in to the issue tracker to add my support but I just get an internal server error!!

I think you’d likely have more success with one of your carefully phrased questions to Customer Services. Perhaps something along the lines of “can you please confirm this is NOT Raxxla”!!!
