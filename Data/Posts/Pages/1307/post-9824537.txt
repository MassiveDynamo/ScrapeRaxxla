But seriously, HPL references haven’t reared their heads much in ED. If MB did write/was integral to implementing Raxxla it’s pretty likely he would include some reference to HPL?

The Pleiades featured heavily in HPL works, so does Delphi, so I imagine that might be relevant.

I’m unsure, as I’m no HPL fan.
We know MB is a big Lovecraft fan. I imagine the concept of Raxxla for this game was put together by MD and DB. While there arent alot of Lovecraftian references... I like to think some of the strange things that happened to the Missing and events on various outposts have a certain Horror to them... I also see that the early hints for Raxxla in the Dark Wheel Missions: the Silence of the Spheres and the The Place that isnt a place, the Door that is also the key.... could be interpreted a certain way.

Yog Sothoth is sometimes described as a conglomeration of spheres...

And as mentioned earlier...

Yog-Sothoth knows the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the key and guardian of the gate. Past, present, future, all are one in Yog-Sothoth. He knows where the Old Ones broke through of old, and where They shall break through again.
- The Necronomicon

Raxxla could have been envisioned not as a doorway which we could go through... but rather as a portal for the unspeakable OId Ones to enter our Galaxy...

But what is he called in ED? Far god?

The crustaceans of Yuggoth worship (Yog Sothoth) as the Beyond-One, and which the vaporous brains of the spiral nebulae know by an untranslatable Sign.
-Through The Gates of the Silver Key

One wonders if the untranslatable sign worn by the Thargoids has some meaning?

Just some random musings
