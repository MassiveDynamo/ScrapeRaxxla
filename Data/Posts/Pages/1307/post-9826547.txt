I think your “egg” is a blurry view of the central sphere of stars in the Andromeda galaxy, and the white dot below it is one of its satellite galaxies.
I’ve always thought this image, being so out of step with the rest of the graphical quality of the star map, was probably an astrophotograph taken by one of the FDev team, possibly by DB himself.
