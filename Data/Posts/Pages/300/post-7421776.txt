I believe you are all wrong... The first line of the toast i am fairly confident is referring to a female astronomer looking through a telescope and having that stars light shine on thier brow. This person would have to be considered in some fashion a Mother of Galaxies.

Could be:

1) Henrietta Swan Leavitt and her discovery of Cepheid stars responsible for giving us the ability to calculate cosmic distances.

2) Jocelyn Bell Burnell who worked with pulsars in particular LGM-1 (Little Green Men)

3) Vera Florence Cooper Rubin - Worked with Galaxy rotation.

Could be more applicable fits all the above in some way link together with galaxies although Vera being the most obvious but lacking that "Star on the brow" unless we are talking about A*.
