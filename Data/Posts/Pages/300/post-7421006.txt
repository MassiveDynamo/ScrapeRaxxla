Friends, it is probably offtop here but I want to ask. How is the information uploaded to the sites like edsm.net? By the people? May stations being fully destroyed? Disappeared from the system? Look at Merope system. In the index there are 4 stations. But in the stations page - only 3. Is it just an error?
