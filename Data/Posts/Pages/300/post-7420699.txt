Tools for viewing the sky from earth: I recommend Stellarium - free and beautiful, and has all the catalogues, star names and constellations. For ED, turn off the ground and the daylight and switch on the constellation lines and images..

In principle you could even set the date correct.

The UI is a bit odd - tabs appear at the edges with various control panels.
