So im not entirley sure if this mystery was cleared up, but I do remember in a previous posts on the thread about the extremley strange objects in the Alpha Cygni System Map. These two “clouds” as I like to refer to them, are constantly fading and growing and changing shap conplegley in the bottome right hand corner, with a bright orb dimming and reappearing between each respectivley. After exploring the system you can view this wether you are in system or not after waiting on the system map screen for around 3-5mins.

This phenomena stunned me as one lf the the most blatant system map visuals I have seen. Wether it is relevant ti the search or not I think its worth looking into, as I have not found much discussion online about this, tho I may be behind the curve here.

Ps. I apologize I had trouble posting a picture of this ontothe forums for complete evidence
