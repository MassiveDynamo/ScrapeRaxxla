Friends, it is probably offtop here but I want to ask. How do uploading info to sites like edsm? By the people? May stations being fully destroyed? Disappeared from the system? Look at Merope system. In the index there are 4 stations. But in the stations page - only 3. Is it just an error?

Actually there are 5 listed at Inara and EDSM. But I think two of them (Lodestar and Thunderhead) are mission related and not dockable.
