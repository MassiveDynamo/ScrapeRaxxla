From my siftings of galnet, not very much but some interesting patterns.

some 'crank' discussed "They took her for their own purposes. Not the lizard people from Andromeda, that’s the Imperial Dynasty. She’s been taken somewhere different.”

https://community.elitedangerous.com/galnet/14-AUG-3301

Many lore famiiy members are in the news:

Journalist Katherine Ryder
Colm Tornquist of the Imperial Herald
Professor Cora Shaw, director of the Palin Institute.

to name a few..

But in general there really isn't much - I haven't got through the whole archive yet, but have another 18 months to go having started at the start in 3301. Galnet has certainly improved over the years

Its worth reading to see how the other in game stories have evolved as this gives us a flavour of how things might work out. Hard going though - lots of community goal messages to wade through.

I see references to 'Station Radio' channels - not come across this - does that mean there is more information than the Galnet news channel? Any idea if this recorded anywhere?
