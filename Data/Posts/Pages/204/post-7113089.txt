I think the opposite; I think the codex will be a way to piece together the bits needed to progress the search. As for the beta, don't think any Raxxla material will be in the beta.
No disrespect: but I hope (for the sake of the search) you are wrong.

I think the codex will just list Raxxla and say the stuff we already know about it, because apparently some people that don't visit the forum keep asking on reddit every month what is raxxla.
