Premonition ? May I ask you what page, Pa. ? [noob]
Because the exact same excerpt appears in Verdi's fan fic. [woah]

page 547/548 in my ecopy. From the recording played during Salomé’s trial. Spoken by the spiky-haired woman, who represented TDW, to Lestenio & Thorn.

The thing I thought striking was that this was an FD-approved novel which aimed to clarify facts, and this wording was therefore probably approved by them. I take this to be an (out of game) clue as to TDW, and hence to SD and its missions.

It also seems to imply that SD is on “the outer rim”, suggesting a) Raxxla is within the bubble, & b) perhaps the missions were part of the obfuscation?

edit: although “the outer rim” could also mean that SD is not the centre of TDW organisation.
