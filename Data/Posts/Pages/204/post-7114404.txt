‘Returned from Deep Space...’ - deep space is the in-game name for any in-system space not a shipping lane or sphere of influence. Could support this theory. If FD aren’t misdirecting us and Raxxla has been Honked, then I agree that the new discovery mechanics might help us find it. .

Raxxla/it’s system may, or may not, have been honked. Nobody has found the FD source for this claim & it is therefore “fake news”
