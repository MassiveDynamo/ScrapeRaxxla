If you read Imprint, it's explained that the Galaxies are just Galcop jump networks.

Only pilots of Elite rank is allowed to apply for full jump priveleges and leave the network. This is probably one of the reasos it was important for Jason Ryder to reach Elite rank.

Ok, I give in, whatâ€™s Imprint?
