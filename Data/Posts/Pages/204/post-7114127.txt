There is also a line in The Dark Wheel about unaccompanied hyperspace jumps that springs to mind (though it might not be canon) that says something like it being exceptionally dangerous to jump beyond 0.1 LY but that up to that distance it was fairly safe. That often makes me think that Raxxla, or evidence for it, might actually be lurking in the Bubble up to 0.1 LY from one of the systems connected to the Faraway network. If that is the case, this is a clue that might be discoverable with the new scanning mechanics in 3.3. If Raxxla or the evidence for it required a longer hyperspace jump, though, then it could be anywhere - the range of the Galactic Hyperdrives is unknown.
‘Returned from Deep Space...’ - deep space is the in-game name for any in-system space not a shipping lane or sphere of influence. Could support this theory. If FD aren’t misdirecting us and Raxxla has been Honked, then I agree that the new discovery mechanics might help us find it. .
