Ah yes, I’d read but forgotten this (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1fwIZbNexwPRV9rXzlYSjlHRlE/edit) a long time ago. So, yes I agree, the wording is identical hence DW =AV. I think it follows that Rebecca was the spiky-haired old woman who was a representative of The Dark Wheel, and they wanted Salomé to lead CoR... We already know from Premonition that R was a member of The Club, hence The Club are part & parcel of TDW. We know/infer from Premonition that Patreus headed the Club, and I think Sirius CEO was also a member (lost my notes, temporarily). Might put some context around the recent Galnet posts about Sirius designs on Ram Tah guardian technology and mysterious raid on his facility. So SD’s TDW might well be on the Outer Rim of TDW, which is likely actually centred around Alioth, Sirius etc. It strengthens my suspicion that Raxxla is hidden within the bubble, probably in one of the unpopulated permit-locked systems. The question then is how to get that permit, has the real Dark Wheel really lost the location of Raxxla? or was that just spin?

I don't think Patreus is heading the Club or is an insider at all.
