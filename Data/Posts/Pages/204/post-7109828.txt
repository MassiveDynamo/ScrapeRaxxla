Imprint is the second official Elite novella. It came with Elite plus, for PC.

These descriptions may have been put in, to smoothen the lore transition from Elite to Frontier. It also describes an external threat to Galcop.

The word 'Imprint' was used as a name for one of the music pieces in FFE and is the official name for Thargoid structures in ED, so it probably holds some significance.

Thanks Han_Zen
I only played the first Elite, so anything since The Dark Wheel until ED and its novels is a mystery to me; apart from DW’s Oolite series, which I greatly enjoyed.

I’ll give Imprint a read!
