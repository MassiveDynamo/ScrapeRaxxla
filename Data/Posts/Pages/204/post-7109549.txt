Ok, I give in, whatâ€™s Imprint?

Imprint is the second official Elite novella. It came with Elite plus, for PC.

These descriptions may have been put in, to smoothen the lore transition from Elite to Frontier. It also describes an external threat to Galcop.

The word 'Imprint' was used as a name for one of the music pieces in FFE and is the official name for Thargoid structures in ED, so it probably holds some significance.
