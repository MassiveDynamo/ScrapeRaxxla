R Monocerotis (the "unicorn" system, obfuscated (only star in the nebula) in the outer rim (position makes sense), not too far from the local bubble but also not too close.)

"According to some astronomers, the "star" R Monocerotis is not more than a very bright concentration of gases within the nebula, and some sky catalogues and atlases do not list it as a star. " -- wikipedia

"Hubble's Variable Nebula" (NGC 2261)

"Chinese astronomers were adept at creating constellations from faint stars, but even they struggled in Monoceros. A chain of four stars consisting of 8, 13, and 17 Monocerotis plus one in southern Gemini formed Sidu, representing the four major rivers of China (Yangtze, Yellow, Huai, and Si). Delta Monocerotis and one other star, probably 18 Mon, formed Queqiu, representing two hillocks either side of a gateway to the palace. According to Sun and Kistemaker (1997) Alpha Monocerotis was part of Tiangou, a guard dog, most of which lay in northern Puppis; other sources, though, place Tiangou farther south. Beta and Gamma Monocerotis seem not to have featured in any Chinese constellation. "
