I think the opposite; I think the codex will be a way to piece together the bits needed to progress the search. As for the beta, don't think any Raxxla material will be in the beta.
No disrespect: but I hope (for the sake of the search) you are wrong.

Oh, believe me, I hope that I'm wrong, too! I just think that putting it in game, front and center like that with potential clues...coupled with the new navigation and exploration tools? Yeah. I don't know. This community has a way of brute forcing things and finding them based off a screenshot of a trailer video. Imagine what they can do now.

Either way, the very first thing I'll be doing in Beta is going to the raxxla page of the Codex. Got my AspEx kitted out and ready to go.
