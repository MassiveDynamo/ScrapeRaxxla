To date ED clues have been provided in-game (the SD TDW missions), but also in livestreams, tweets, and in the Frontier Forums, of which this is just one thread. People have rightly complained that they aren’t aware of these because they don’t watch/have time for livestreams, or to read all posts in relevant threads, etc. Galnet articles used to do this but were still out of the game and the mechanism has been sparsely used for a long time now, although FD made an attempt to bring it in-game and narrated to promote people to get the information. I think the Codex is a new formal way of providing clues and other information in-game in a consistent way.

I think when the Codex starts to become populated (I don’t expect it all to happen instantaneously on release day) I think for Raxxla we’ll see the statements from the SD TDW missions that were removed: “A certain celestial body, Place that is not a Place, Door that is also the Key, the myth; Obfuscated in the Outer Rim,; Silent Song of the Spheres” but not much more (I keep an open mind and may be pleasantly surprised).

Unless they also put this one in: “Shinrarta is merely a front..You should not consider the Dark Wheel a single organisation..It is more akin to an affiliation of organisations that share certain common goals. Interlocking in purpose. Consider yourselves now spinning on the outermost rim.” For me this bit of DW’s book (FD-sponsored & explicitly aimed at wrapping up different bits of info) is quite intriguing.
