I feel confident that the Codex is going to be the death of this search. I'm thinking, sadly, it will be found before Beta is done.

I think the opposite; I think the codex will be a way to piece together the bits needed to progress the search. As for the beta, don't think any Raxxla material will be in the beta.
No disrespect: but I hope (for the sake of the search) you are wrong.
