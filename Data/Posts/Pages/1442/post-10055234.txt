*I've just read that the Dredgers were in 2.4, and two of them (Artificers and Phagos) appeared in the 2.4 Beta, but were never seen in game (assumed to be not in game for that reason). That's very interesting to me. Maybe they have been in game just never found? that means your 3303 screenshot could well have reflected a Dredger in-system?
I'm zigzagging my way down, I'm 1200LY above just poking some old megaship wrecks from the past.
But I assume we're 5 years late ...

Is the Artificer's dredger still in Upaniklis, do you know?
