Ooh that's intriguing! I wonder if maybe the Dredgers would be considered 'independent' in that way? I know they weren't physically in-game back then* but iirc the lore for Dredgers has existed since... was it FE2?
Earlier much, much earlier....

From the first game's manual and their description is absolutely wild.
