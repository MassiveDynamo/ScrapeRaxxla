Ah, right. Nice old coincidence?
D-12 1172 (Spirograph) back in the early days had a 'independent' status (2017/3303).
That glitch was quickly ironed over by FDev after it was discussed on the forums in regards to Wreaken & Col 70.
I kept the bookmark from then.

It's almost in line as you said, BD-12 1172 is a tad lower down.

Ooh that's intriguing! I wonder if maybe the Dredgers would be considered 'independent' in that way? I know they weren't physically in-game back then* but iirc the lore for Dredgers has existed since... was it FE2?

Lots of ringed planets there too, It would be a good place for a Dredger clan ship to refuel. I'm loosely speculating that they must have some systems marked as their own version of green systems, presumably one with many rings would be potentially such a system.

*I've just read that the Dredgers were in 2.4, and two of them (Artificers and Phagos) appeared in the 2.4 Beta, but were never seen in game (assumed to be not in game for that reason). That's very interesting to me. Maybe they have been in game just never found? that means your 3303 screenshot could well have reflected a Dredger in-system?

Unfortunately I'm 1300ly away following the approximate vector the other way... tempted to go look at Spirograph though.

Is the Artificer's dredger still in Upaniklis, do you know?
