I may be a bit more sceptical than you...or maybe I’m just getting crotchety with old age!

I suspect that Raxxla has not been materially changed at all since the gamma & I don't think Odyssey will bring any new clues.

I also suspect it was originally hidden, either by a permit (which we probably all have by now obtained!) or by a set of conditions which were only introduced later. The reason for this belief is Drew Wagar’s statement that DB said something along the lines of “Raxxla is in-game, we (i.e. FD) know where it is and we know why it hasn't been found”. Drew only mentioned that latter bit in a couple of references I’ve found.

The other reason for my beliefs are the way I think FD/DB/MB operate, and the apparent lack of open knowledge of anything to do with Raxxla within FD-I’m metagaming! If Raxxla had been updated then more people would have been invoved (graphics designers, game designers, code implementers...) which would make the secret much harder to keep...so I think there would have been leaks.

P.S. I also suspect the FSS will be no help at all in finding Raxxla!

Fair enough, I'm not against that idea either. The way I work at the moment facilitates for all of them That's the thing I like since we don't know what to focus our efforts on really. So just keep playing the game of Raxxla, turning any stones if I happen to see one. Observe. Pay attention, Try out anything that may be relevant.
It gives me an opportunity & reason to play the game. We all do the same I guess. o7
