Maybe they have been in game just never found?

Here’s the answer to that:

Just a quick one for the followers of this thread.

I got confirmation from FD the other week that the Space Dredgers hadn't made it into the live game.

(I realise that it was generally accepted that that was the situation, but I'd never been able to find any actual confirmation of it from FD.)

Confirmation was on the livestream on Thursday 25th June. Time was around 19:30 - 19:35. I can't find a recording of the stream at the moment, unfortunately.

Anyway, I'd asked the CMs if they could check the situation a few weeks prior to that (as they wouldn't have been around for it so chances are they wouldn't even know what I was talking about), so just asked if there was any news about it and Stephen confirmed the situation, and said the devs knew it had been getting asked about.
