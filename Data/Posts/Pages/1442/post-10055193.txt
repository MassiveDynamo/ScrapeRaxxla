If you put Oochost PC-C c29-0 and Perseus Dark Region KC-V c2-2 (where the Scriveners Dredger was first spotted) into Galmap, you can see a potential 'direction of travel' vector.
Ah, right. Nice old coincidence?
BD-12 1172 (Spirograph) back in the early days had a 'independent' status (2017/3303).
That glitch was quickly ironed over by FDev after it was discussed on the forums in regards to Wreaken & Col 70.
I kept the bookmark from then.

It's almost in line as you said, BD-12 1172 is a tad lower down.
