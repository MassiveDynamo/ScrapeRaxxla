I doubt that was in the col70 sector, while it's always hard to place locations from the novels, Col70 is extremely far away and it's clear in AHTW they are using 2b drives given the travel times they (frequently) quote.

Wreaken is absolutely mentioned, but they also do have outposts in many places. I'm not sure a bunch of pirates would travel hundreds of lightyears outside known space to attack an outpost.

First time I've heard that. I'd be interested if you can recall the quote? It's been years since I read that one, I'd prefer not to have to re-read a Drew book
Just looked it up: Premonition, Chapter 23, page 337 and the few pages leading up to it.
