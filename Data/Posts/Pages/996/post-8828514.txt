I dont know about neutron stars being whisperers... but there is that one reference to the audio sounds in the witchspace tunnel by fdev ( 1.3 update) "Improved mix on hyperspace tunnel whispers and flybys." https://community.elitedangerous.com/fr/node/190

Also the mentions in the Generation Ship Logs...
Generation Ship Epimetheus: "It’s whispering to me. I can hear it through the air vents. The void is speaking to me. It wants to tell me something, but I can t make out the words. It must be a way out of this prison. A solution to the puzzle."

Generation Ship Thetis: "Still all quiet out here in the black......They’ve heard some kind of strange whispering sound coming from their apartment comms unit.... It’s the same message relayed again and again and again – it’s more a whisper than anything else; it says, ‘kill them all’..."

I like to think the whispers are coming from the murderous Guardian AI who inhabit a secret realm within witchspace.

Thanks mate, not seen that 1.3 update change list before. So FD officially said there are whispers in witchspace! Next job is to decide what causes them!
