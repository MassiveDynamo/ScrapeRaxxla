Thats dangerous thinking, I like it!

Raxxla has always sounded like an alien name to me, so unless it’s the ‘goid name for their homeworld or a mothership then it might be Guardian. Always felt there was something we were missing about those sites, and their space beacons are definitely overly-fancy for what they (currently) do.
