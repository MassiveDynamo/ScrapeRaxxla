I know this is potentially 'old' Raxxla lore, but I had a curious thought when I recently picked up a tubular key at home (I know I hear you say, who has time for RL?!) and it aligned with the statement - "A certain celestial body. You know the one I mean. Place that isn't a place, door that is also the key. The myth."

So I did a bit of delving, and if you look at the red bolts of the lock image below, they appear to be the same shape as the outer black boxes on the Raxxla logo?

Which lead me to think about the Guardians, and specifically:
It'd be a journey we'd all have to take, as someone finding Raxxla this way would still prevent anyone else from just going directly there as they'd also have to activate all the Beacons, and unlock the guardian sites?

It's also something FDev could track as it's in your codex?
