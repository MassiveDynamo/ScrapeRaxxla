There at least seem to be some incorporeal intelligence capable of telepathic communication, lurking in the galaxy. Both Halsey and Romero have presented their experience with them, on Galnet.

Guardian AI are a good candidate to have evolved into these 'Caretakers'.

There is definitely sound of whispering/voices to be heard at Guardian sites, so I think they inhabit their comms network. It was striking when I was gathering guardian relics to drop (“omphalos”) when I was investigating the double black hole hypothesis.
