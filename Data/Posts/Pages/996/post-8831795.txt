Tyko is slowly making his way back from Goliath’s Rest, but keeps getting distracted to dive Black Holes and do a bit of surveying on the way. Came across an MS star today, not seen one of those before!

Edit: and I hear that Sirius Atmospherics is going to be terraforming Ammonia Worlds in the Coalsack.
Think there’s going to be an awful lot of angry Thargoids buzzing around!
The goids are going to flip. They will probably start ammoniating earth-likes, to return the favour. I'm sure the Alliance is doing this, to make trouble for the Empire and Federation in some way. They are up to something.
