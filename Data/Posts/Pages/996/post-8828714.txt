There is definitely sound of whispering/voices to be heard at Guardian sites, so I think they inhabit their comms network. It was striking when I was gathering guardian relics to drop (“omphalos”) when I was investigating the double black hole hypothesis.
The Guardian ruins checks all the Raxxla boxes of old. Planet with alien construct. Gateway to the monolith network (probably contains virtual universes for the AI). Acceptable distance to the bubble.
Their existence was even known and leaked by the Club (band of elites).

Perhaps this was what Jason found evidence for, not the real Raxxla?
Perhaps we have found a bunch of Raxxlas? We just haven't figured out how to activate the gateway.

I would be surprised if that was the answer, but who knows?
