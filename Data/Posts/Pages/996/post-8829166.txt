I think the widely held opinion is Thargs are the Whisperers of Witchspace. Without any real evidence its been that way for a while.

but Im not sure the Halsey and other incidents are 1) even connected to each other and 2) connected to the Raxxla mystery.

So maybe they kind of confirmed the whisperer bit, maybe not, all they did confirm is that Thargs inhabit WS as they used to and was only in doubt in ED itself afaik. More interesting I thought was the Col 70 implications. Carefully worded as not the 'home', doesnt mean they aint got a nice second home there, but if not Thargs, then what in the name of Baldrick is that Sector locked off for!?
Might be the Guardians Home world(s), might even be Raxxla itself. Who besides FDev know?

IMO The confirmation of Thargoids inhabiting WS possibly opens up a whole lot more than just "Thargoids Inhabit Witch Space". As I see it, it could have now been possible that the Thargoids that caused Jameson's miss-jump, amongst other unanswered quirries. The Thargoids could be the ones that left the residues of sound at Guardian sites with there Scanings or whatever they do, searching for whatever?

The Thargoids themselves could be "The Door that is also A Key" and the Omphalos Rift could be Witch Space itself?

Or I might be just completely wrong in the assumptions.
