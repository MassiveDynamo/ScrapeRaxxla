Got some more Phekda tinfoil. This time it involves New California. Apparently in the historical timeline New California was a planet terraformed in Alioth back in the day. Yet, there is no New California there now (I haven’t verified yet so don’t hate me) but there is a New California in Phekda and Epsilon Eridani. Why create a timeline with a strange terraformed planet that causes mutations in Alioth that isn’t there in game and the nearest “New California” is in Phekda instead? I’m confused. Here’s a timeline someone made of Alliance history, note the mentions of New California in Alioth, unless I’m missing something.

Bonus tinfoil: Galnet article detailing the discovery of a nuclear weapon on Earth of the coast of California. Might be nothing.

Due to the proc. gen. naming convention in FE2, there was a bunch of New Californias, New Africas, New Americas, New Caledonias and so on. This made it a bit difficult to follow the news articles in FFE, that largely used the same galaxy.

Quite a few of these 'New' names have carried over to ED, but some have been lost. Many of them because the old galaxy simply had to many earth likes in a system, to be astronomically viable.
