The Guardian ruins checks all the Raxxla boxes of old. Planet with alien construct. Gateway to the monolith network (probably contains virtual universes for the AI). Acceptable distance to the bubble.
Their existence was even known and leaked by the Club (band of elites).

Perhaps this was what Jason found evidence for, not the real Raxxla?
Perhaps we have found a bunch of Raxxlas? We just haven't figured out how to activate the gateway.

I would be surprised if that was the answer, but who knows?

Why the double XX?
Sounds like the rubbing of limbs on a wingcase to me!
