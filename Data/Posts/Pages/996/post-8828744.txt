The idea of directional audio at the guardian sites pointing at other sites or other stuff is rather interesting. The thargoid stuff tight beams shows they are capable of hiding stuff this way. We never got an explanation for the rotating stuff under some of the sites in the early days. Perhaps the audio beam is rotating around like a radar disk as it scans the sky. A rotating signal would likely need 9 cmdrs to coordinate in 3 groups of 3. With the groups 120 degrees apart, and ~10 degrees of separation within each group.

Lave Radio 319 Seemed to suggest some sort of rare/elite missions might still be popping up on missions boards. (it seemed to be in response to something a dev said regarding how the mission board works with regards to mission visibility/ mission spawning.) So looking for oddly worded or rare mission/mission types on the mission board may be worth doing. They have done stuff sort of in this vein before with regards to the thargoid worshiping cultists and black flight (at least i think they where black flight ship. (it has been a while since these missions spawned, and my memory if foggy) They where studying the thargoid stuff at any rate) ships if memory serves. (missions hinting at story stuff yet to come)
