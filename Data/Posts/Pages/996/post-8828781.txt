thatll take you to page 9, cant do a p1 link.

Whats this about Thargs? I got that they inhabited Witch Space in a way humans couldnt access (in response to Q about Col 70 being their 'home') but missed any telepathy or whatever connection?

Edit: Yes the AMA last for 1 hour, Wed 15.00 UTC / IGT. Done 2 so far with 3 CMs Bruce, Paul & Stephen and Arthur (Lead CM).

I think the connection with the Thargs is that FDev confirmed Thargs inhabit Witch Space, and Whisperers in Witch Space may only be by the (now confirmed) Thargs that inhabit there. Nothing else confirmed (as of yet) to inhabit there. So (as I see it) it can only be the Thargoids until any confirmation of something else is there.

IMO Quite a bit of solid evidence slipped and maybe an unintended clue by FDev.
