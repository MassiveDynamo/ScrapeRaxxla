I think the widely held opinion is Thargs are the Whisperers of Witchspace. Without any real evidence its been that way for a while.

but Im not sure the Halsey and other incidents are 1) even connected to each other and 2) connected to the Raxxla mystery.

So maybe they kind of confirmed the whisperer bit, maybe not, all they did confirm is that Thargs inhabit WS as they used to and was only in doubt in ED itself afaik. More interesting I thought was the Col 70 implications. Carefully worded as not the 'home', doesnt mean they aint got a nice second home there, but if not Thargs, then what in the name of Baldrick is that Sector locked off for!?
