Tyko is slowly making his way back from Goliath’s Rest, but keeps getting distracted to dive Black Holes and do a bit of surveying on the way. Came across an MS star today, not seen one of those before!

Edit: and I hear that Sirius Atmospherics is going to be terraforming Ammonia Worlds in the Coalsack.
Think there’s going to be an awful lot of angry Thargoids buzzing around!
