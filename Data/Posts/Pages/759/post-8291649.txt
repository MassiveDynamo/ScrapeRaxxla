I dont know whether this has been pointed out before but Raxxla sounds very like the stories of the King in Yellow and lost Carcosa, particularly the obsession and madness inducing properties it is said to have.
"Along the shore the cloud waves break,
The twin suns sink behind the lake,
The shadows lengthen
In Carcosa.

Strange is the night where black stars rise,
And strange moons circle through the skies,
But stranger still is
Lost Carcosa. "
The King in Yellow - Wikipedia
en.wikipedia.org

I dont have the books to hand but, again from Wikipedia, there are some tantalising astronomical references:
"He mentioned the establishment of the Dynasty in Carcosa, the lakes which connected Hastur, Aldebaran and the mystery of the Hyades. He spoke of Cassilda and Camilla, and sounded the cloudy depths of Demhe, and the Lake of Hali."

Aldebaran is a recurring presence in the stories of Bierce and Lovecraft; there are others, though some of the classical references may need deciphering. Might be worth mapping some of these out, seeing how they fit with what is known of Raxxla.

But; is this search a search for madness? Are we deeply engaged in Act I of the play, yearning for Act II but woe betide anyone who glimpses the truth, who sees Raxxla?
I fear Raxxla could be a portal of Nyralahotep, the crawling chaos; leading to a place where mortal minds are torn apart by elation and despair.
