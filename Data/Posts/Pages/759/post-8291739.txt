Personally, I love to rattle the very foundations of the those in power. They been sitting on their Ivory towers manipulating everyone like chess pieces as if they were gods themselves. Pushing us forward into conflict to only further their own agenda, they don't care about the people but only themselves. Their wealth, power, and information that they seem to cling close to will also be their downfall. They sit there comfortably believing in the idea of being untouchable when in reality their greatest strength is also their achilles' heel.
