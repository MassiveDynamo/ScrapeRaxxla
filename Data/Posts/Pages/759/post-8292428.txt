Im so jealous of you guys that have actual educations. I learn most everything from science channek, discovery channel, @GURU-951's threads/yt and what you all have shared on here. Its sad to think most of my coworkers think im one of the brightest guys they know lol.
Meh, education indoctrination is highly over-rated.
