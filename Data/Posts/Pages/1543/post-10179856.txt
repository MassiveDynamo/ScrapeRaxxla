Walden, is a reference to the book by Henry David Thoreau, which is about taking in the natural beatuy of nature, in the absence of other people. In the book Lave Revolution mentions one of the Waldens meeting "Walden 2" and from there is takes on the tone of the book Walden 2 which was written by B. F. Skinner. This book sands in stark contrast to Walden as it takes on a contradictory stance of self reliance in a group. The premise is that the society is controlled and orchestrated by a single person (or persons in this case). If Walden was/is Dark Wheel, perhaps he had gone wrong somewhere.
I now need to look up something on the very first page of "Alien World: A Complete Illustrated Guide" that may help. Psychology is deeply interwoven into this mystery. There are very good reasons for why I had to be the proverbial salmon fighting the current but it is a bit hard to explain. Will get a screenshot and post an analysis. I think if we understand this a bit more this puzzle will make more sense.
