Has anyone else ever been to Placet - specifically Placet B (it is a planet)? It is part of Old Worlds Coalition region. We were supposed to look for Walden. Hear me out here: What if Walden is part of The Dark Wheel? It is a weird little system on the outskirts of that region with a bizarre history:

The weird part is system looks abandoned. It also has the 8 moons of an unnamed gas giant.

I just need a way to see something hidden..
Walden, is a reference to the book by Henry David Thoreau, which is about taking in the natural beatuy of nature, in the absence of other people. In the book Lave Revolution mentions one of the Waldens meeting "Walden 2" and from there is takes on the tone of the book Walden 2 which was written by B. F. Skinner. This book sands in stark contrast to Walden as it takes on a contradictory stance of self reliance in a group. The premise is that the society is controlled and orchestrated by a single person (or persons in this case). If Walden was/is Dark Wheel, perhaps he had gone wrong somewhere.
