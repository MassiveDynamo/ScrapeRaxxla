I don't quite understand the meaning of the words : original group.
And now ...
The phrasing opens up the possibility that the current TDW faction seen in-game is not the original TDW. That leads onto the in-game possibilities that the original TDW no longer exist, or that the original group no longer goes by that name, &/or that current TDW faction are imposters making use of the reputation of the original group for their own (possibly nefarious) purposes. Read this in conjunction with the TDW Codex entry!

All this is part of what @Rochester said in his 21:42 post above (https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-10179211). that plans seem to have been established for a TDW / Raxxla narrative but that it is not clear that narrative actually now exists in-game. It might be speculated that such narrative plans were originated/driven by Michael Brookes but they were dropped around the time when he left the ED dev team.

Members of this thread have asked FD for confirmation that such narrative still exists in-game but no confirmation has been received.
