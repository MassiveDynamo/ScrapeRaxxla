The phrasing opens up the possibility that the current TDW faction seen in-game is not the original TDW. That leads onto the in-game possibilities that the original TDW no longer exist, or that the original group no longer goes by that name, &/or that current TDW faction are imposters making use of the reputation of the original group for their own (possibly nefarious) purposes. Read this in conjunction with the TDW Codex entry!

All this is part of what @Rochester said in his 21:42 post above (https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-10179211)...that plans seem to have been established for a TDW / Raxxla narrative but that it is not clear that narrative actually now exists in-game. It might be speculated that such narrative plans were originated/driven by Michael Brookes but they were dropped around the time when he left the ED dev team.

Members of this thread have asked FD for confirmation that such narrative still exists in-game but no confirmation has been received.
I found my old (before the Odyssey, I will need to compare with the Odyssey) screen of the TDW Codex entry.
It also says about 8 moons, but it sounds different: at the dawn of the organization.
Those. when the organization first appeared.
Again, below it is written that this station is still there and working.

P.S.
Interestingly. At the beginning of the article it is written that all TDW imitators quickly disappear.
At the end of the article there is an entry about TDW in Shinart D...
If she's a copycat, why didn't she disappear?

P.P.S. By the way, who is familiar with the numbering and name of bodies in the system ? It says it's the 8th moon of an unnamed gas giant.
In the unnamed star, what are the names of the planets? Should it be something like XXXX-D-8 or what?
