I found my old (before the Odyssey, I will need to compare with the Odyssey) screen of the TDW Codex entry.
It also says about 8 moons, but it sounds different: at the dawn of the organization.
Those. when the organization first appeared.
Again, below it is written that this station is still there and working.

P.S.
Interestingly. At the beginning of the article it is written that all TDW imitators quickly disappear.
At the end of the article there is an entry about TDV in Shinart D...
If she's a copycat, why didn't she disappear?
Likelihood is that A: as the text alludes, they have not risen to any state to warrant them being considered a threat; B: that FD has plans for that faction, and has simply ‘paused’ that narrative.

At one point a single Cmdr was able to flip the status of the SD system to anarchy, FD quickly reset it, indicating they liked the status quo.

FD has indicated via a series of independent tickets, that the DW missions were removed, but may be turned back on at an unknown point in time, likewise in regards the associated Trinkets of Hidden Fortune, indicating a narrative existed but was retconned circa 2016/2017. It’s FD prerogative as to if they choose to reinstate that narrative or leave it alone.

Either way I’m inclined to suspect it’s a redundant narrative. One could read the DW Codex as confirmation of this. However, the evidence of ‘new’ information, ergo the description of the DW station and a gas giant with an eighth moon is new intelligence - indicating the possibility a station could be out there and just needs finding.

If viewed in that respect it could just relate to a re-write, and the station can just be found by anyone, it’s just out there someplace.
