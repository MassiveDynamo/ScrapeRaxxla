Like to mention the excellent work by @ScolioTheMost on the Discord channel in regards to the spectro-audio analysis discovered in the recordings of stations. There is an obviously sequential set of numbers and letters behind the audio: 0-9, A-Z, seemingly random, which deserves more analysis.
Recently on one Russian video there was a clip about what unclear signs at the stations and that they are not at all stations. It's not clear what it is, but I think it's just light math.
