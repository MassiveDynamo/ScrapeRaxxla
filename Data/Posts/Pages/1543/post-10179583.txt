Has anyone else ever been to Placet - specifically Placet B (it is a planet)? It is part of Old Worlds Coalition region. We were supposed to look for Walden. Hear me out here: What if Walden is part of The Dark Wheel? It is a weird little system on the outskirts of that region with a bizarre history:





The weird part is system looks abandoned. It also has the 8 moons of an unnamed gas giant.

I just need a way to see something hidden..
