This is what I was twiddling my thumbs about. I was curious how quickly it would end up here.
I would like to point out that these codes have been known about since before I was playing over six years ago. Many have attempted to crack it and everyone as far as we know have given up.
My contributions is tying the Raxxla logo to the signal. It finally clicks. (you have to click the gif to see the animation)

Logo Breakdown:
Notice in the image the dotted line is the shape made by the lights.
The large black objects are the support structures for the back of a station.
The three lines are the three lights at the back of each station, and/or they line up with details on the back of the station.
The circle with the dot (sometimes Sol, more often refered to as an Omphalos, or more recently an "Axis Mundi") is the rotation axis of the space station and the point at which the characters can be picked up in the station (only while in the station, I suggest docking and staying on the surface)
Since the Dark Wheel codex icon represents an orbis station it makes sense the Raxxla icon would represent a thing in the game
Discussions are happening on the IRH and Canonn discords, and should certain happen here
I think its been hinted at for a while that maybe TDW station has a 'Gateway' at the back, we maybe need to find someway to activate it.
