I doubt there is an active Raxxla narrativ in the game, at the moment. Perhaps there never was one?
Most likely the E/F missions were switched over to the Guardian story line. After all, the Guardian ruins are perfect Raxxlas. Ghost worlds, alien constructs and access to tech from another universe.
It’s possible that the original idea and model for Raxxla, were used for these ruins.

It is also possible that the ruins actually are Raxxla and that we just haven’t been able to prove it.

Depends what you mean by narrative!
