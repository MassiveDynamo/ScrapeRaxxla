I suspect it might be significant that Drew Wagar’s Elite Reclamation book had a character explicitly say TDW in Shinrarta are just a front, & “the outer rim” of a multi-layered organisation that operates “wheels within wheels”. The duplication of that “outer rim” phrase with its first use in the description of one of the deleted Shinrarta E/F missions is what sets me pondering. I wonder if the apparent dropping of a TDW storyline is related to the clear falling out of DW and FD....he clearly wasn't impressed with their storytelling ability (witness his comments on PowerPlay).

Now I fully accept that as well as their love for the game itself FD also have commercial drivers for the way the game develops and the narratives within it, so there might be sound reasons for the termination of such a storyline. IIRC a lot of retconning happened around the time FD went more commercial, gaining outside financial backing & those backers would presumably have a say in the way the game developed.

Perhaps this and other storylines were put on a back burner to be restarted when the Thargoid war is over? Personally I think that would be a mistake as these other storylines are needed for non-pewpewers to remain connected with the game. Once player interest is lost then it’s lost.
I doubt there is an active Raxxla narrativ in the game, at the moment. Perhaps there never was one?
Most likely the E/F missions were switched over to the Guardian story line. After all, the Guardian ruins are perfect Raxxlas. Ghost worlds, alien constructs and access to tech from another universe.
It’s possible that the original idea and model for Raxxla, were used for these ruins.

It is also possible that the ruins actually are Raxxla and that we just haven’t been able to prove it.
