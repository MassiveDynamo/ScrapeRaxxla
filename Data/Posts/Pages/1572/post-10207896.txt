Take the lost realms systems as an example. You have the names in ‘the names’ list, after each other.
When you append this list to the ‘systems that need a name’ list, it is reasonable that the end up in systems close to each other.

Doing it this way is easy and as a bonus you get a sense of regional connection between systems.
You don't solve problems by thinking like a programmer when it is about mythology. I would operate as though it was designed this way on purpose. You still aren't dealing with the issue itself. Also, if Raxxla was found in 2296 or earlier it may be near either capitol system (though we do have that annoying gap from 2230 - 2296 also known as "era of rapid expansion").
