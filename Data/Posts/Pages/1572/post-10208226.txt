That may be oversimplifying matters. Example, South City, Xezaor from the TDW novella. This is one of the systems Alex Ryder passed through on his travels. Canonically, per several sources Coriolis stations as activity died down in a system (this was an older star) are converted to outposts to reclaim materials for new systems and to right-size the station for the amount of traffic. Additionally, the Dodo designs were being decommissioned. There is but one "South City" in all of Elite Dangerous in Hurukuntak. Perhaps that is enough to believe it is true. There are two outposts (South City and Bullialdus City) in the system and a newer Coriolis named Bauschinger Terminal. Just because things changed and time passes doesn't make the past automatically false or just myth.

Do you believe in Raxxla or not? If not, why are you here?

Didn't all Coriolis stations have a South City and a North City, according to TDW?

"A Coriolis station is nothing less than a vast city built on six planes and spread, around the wide empty sky of its interior, facing inwards. From South City, the roof on the world is North City. At night, the lights that glow above your head are the lights of streets and buildings."

Could be I'm reading it wrong, but I don't think the ' South City' name was exclusive to Xeazor.
