I mean that in the most kind and sincere way possible. If you won't go look, why bother?
Of course I believe in Raxxla.
I believe that Raxxla is a real location with a mysterious device, built by an ancient alien civilization

I believe it’s something real, that was actually usefull to the aliens.

I guess it may have been located shortly after the Mars relic was found, by a very small group. After the roumor of it’s existence started to spread, they went completly silent and hid the relic.
I don’t think anyone outside this group has found it.

I also have a feeling that the Raxxla building aliens visited earth and interacted with humans, some time between 10000 BC - 2000 BC.

I think the names that matters are the names of constelations and stars that were known to those may have interacted with the aliens.
