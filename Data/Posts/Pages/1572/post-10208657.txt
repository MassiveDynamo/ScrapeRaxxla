Didn't all Coriolis stations have a South City and a North City, according to TDW?

"A Coriolis station is nothing less than a vast city built on six planes and spread, around the wide empty sky of its interior, facing inwards. From South City, the roof on the world is North City. At night, the lights that glow above your head are the lights of streets and buildings."

Could be I'm reading it wrong, but I don't think the ' South City' name was exclusive to Xeazor.
Good catch. Would South City and North City be the end-caps? To me it almost feels like Orbis were developed when someone realized having a very alien looking station might just bring some suspicion from the locals.

Also, pay attention when you are traveling. There are sub-types on Coriolis stations that are visible on the exterior. Environmental lighting has multiple variants including the blue-green like Guardians. Don't know if it is a homeage to Oolite. I do suspect colors are significantly more important. Reading through Holdstock he used color symbolism a lot. I really should do a dedicated posting on the forums about color symbolism utilized by TDW and how Mic Turner was a huge insight into all this. The colors are not randomly chosen in Elite Dangerous and a lot of it goes back to Earth. It is actually really fascinating.

P.S.: Half tempted to just run with Essafa indicating Mic Turner was from Earth when I do this. In many ways, that explanation seems easier. But will probably post both given the Jones Colony bit. The deeper connection are the Druze and it explains so damn much.
