I’ve long said Facece is a good fit. The path of Jacques is peculiar,

Not only does Facece sit at the heart of the Lost Realms fulcrum, it oddly passes a system named Bridge and a Gen ship named after ‘death’ which potentially could be a Miltonian reference, but also said ‘bridge’ hits a boundary which ‘other’ systems linked to RH ‘wider’ Lost Realms might also sit upon; namely the boundary of the underworld…. It’s circumstantial at most, possibly an archeological dropped narrative, but nether the less it’s one of our best leads I believe.

*Rough draft of Lost Realms boundary of underworld (to be published in full real soon).
