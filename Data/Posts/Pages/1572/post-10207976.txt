CMDRCorrMorningstarFelian makes a good point about lessons (and maybe other hints or clues) being found in the description of Individuals in the Codex (and perhaps, by extension, other areas e.g. Corporations). I shall have to go back and review mentions of dates and systems. The entry that has always stood out the most to me is that of Alba Tesreau. Her beginning in an isolated community is reminiscent of The Dark Wheel's self-isolation.

I agree that the Mars relic is an indicator that another alien civilisation visited Earth - but it is proof that they visited Mars. I wonder what they wanted there, or is the relic just something that was left behind from routine exploration?

If Raxxla was originally discovered, as seems likely, during the era of rapid expansion, then to be ingrained in myth by 2296, it could well have been found decades before then, in the earlier stage of that expansion. That might also bring us back to a deep space location for Raxxla, with a Generation Ship leaving Sol on a heading to another system and passing close to it. However, the mythological leads pointing to the Lost Realms region and references to moons and moon goddesses, suggest to me that it is on or in immediate proximity to a moon, very possibly a remote one but still not requiring us to travel for LY in supercruise on an imprecise heading when we might need to be within 1000Ls for it to show up on our Nav Panel.

The issue of whether we will get any indication from any kind of scan or nav panel poi or have to eyeball it is a different matter!
