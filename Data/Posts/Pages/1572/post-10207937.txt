Everyone knows it’s the same universe. The old games and old novellas are just not accurate descriptions of that universe. They are stories and myths.
There are things that are true and things that aren’t. This is the easy path. When the old stories doesn’t fit the vision of the new game, the vision wins.
That may be oversimplifying matters. Example, South City, Xezaor from the TDW novella. This is one of the systems Alex Ryder passed through on his travels. Canonically, per several sources Coriolis stations as activity died down in a system (this was an older star) are converted to outposts to reclaim materials for new systems and to right-size the station for the amount of traffic. Additionally, the Dodo designs were being decommissioned. There is but one "South City" in all of Elite Dangerous in Hurukuntak. Perhaps that is enough to believe it is true. There are two outposts (South City and Bullialdus City) in the system and a newer Coriolis named Bauschinger Terminal. Just because things changed and time passes doesn't make the past automatically false or just myth.

Do you believe in Raxxla or not? If not, why are you here?
