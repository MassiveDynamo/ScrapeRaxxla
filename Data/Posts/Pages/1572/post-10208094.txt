Before anyone argues that cannot be:

Oresrians are in TDW novella from the first game.
Frontier / First Encounters (both occur between 3200 -3300) both make reference to ancient alien civilization.
FFE journals explicitly referenced another intelligent species beyond just a Thargoids. It was notably a species that the Thargoids had been at war with for millions of years.
Orbis stations are present in Facece for the TDW station (2 actually) as well as a secondary Coriolis.
Insofar as checking it this could have been ignored for years because Holo-diagram of stations is not accurate until you drop at station and request docking. Even then, the CMDR would need to be paying attention as they dock.
There is nothing in the established lore that would prevent this being a potential solution.
