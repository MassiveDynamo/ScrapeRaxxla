"A Coriolis station is nothing less than a vast city built on six planes and spread, around the wide empty sky of its interior, facing inwards. From South City, the roof on the world is North City. At night, the lights that glow above your head are the lights of streets and buildings."
Could this be a figure of speech for the northern celestial sphere? Remember, Frameshift Suite featurles constellations almost exclusively in the northern celestial sphere. This would be in line with Axis Mundi/World Tree/Yggradasil. I've learned better than to take things too literally, occasionally. Also, FFE journals references to Northern Edge is typically a reference to northern celestial sphere as viewed from Earth - in other words generally in the direction of Alioth and Ursa Major/Ursa Minor/Draco.
