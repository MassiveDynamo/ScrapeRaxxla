Good spot about Avalonia, but I have to disagree -those phrases were not italicised in the novella:
Elite: The Dark Wheel

“Jason Ryder was convinced that Raxxla existed. That's why he trained for, and became a part of, the Dark Wheel, the legend-seekers. I hadn't heard much from him or about him for some time until just before he died, when he told me he'd found evidence for the real existence of Raxxla. He came back from
Deep Space to get a proper team together . . .

I have a copy of The Dark Wheel that came with the original BBCB version (I had the cassette version). It is italicised there as I have shown. I wouldn't read anything special into it, though.
