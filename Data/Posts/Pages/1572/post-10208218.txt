I have a copy of The Dark Wheel that came with the original BBCB version (I had the cassette version). It is italicised there as I have shown. I wouldn't read anything special into it, though.
Ah, that’s interesting. Wonder why the emphasis was removed in the eversion; no italics on “evidence” but Deep Space is indeed title case.....so a specific name rather than a generic description. There’s also a line break immediately before it.....

Yes, I had the cassette version too! Happy days!
