Though just to clarify, although all of the Club have featured in Galnet, there's nothing to say we hear of all of them often via Galnet.

True!

Han_Zen mentioned it above before I could say it (going to anyway ) but “Princess Astrophel” could represent a Thargoid:
since they are all female (I believe)
a princess is a young queen, and queen insects lay eggs, and there are eggs in the Thargoid structures which show the ‘spiralling stars’ .

In conjunction with the possible Maia solution to the earlier clue (who posted that? Can’t find it) then it is suggestive.
