Astrophel in the poem is a bloke (the Author) - no princess The name means 'Star Lover' - I think this is likely a false positive, in the same way that obscure biblical analysis gives 'Raxxla' as a form of 'Gallicia' in greek.

Have you been in a washing machine ?

The 'child' thing petered out for me. after a couple of missions being given. It seems this is a new game mechanic in 3.3 and also that NPC's called child have been seen in other systems. A cold lead for me at the moment, but maybe I screwed up the sequence or didn't have the pre-requisites, etc. Who knows..

I like the idea of the tale of Odysseus, it being a 'personal journey' - it fits some of the bits of the toast, but fails at the first hurdle, the 'mother of galaxies' bit and also many of the names in the Odyssey are not in game.

The 'Mother of Galaxies' is very curious, as there can be no mythological reference to galaxies, as the concept wasn't around then - there was only the milky way, and the Greek's/Romans had no idea that it was made of stars. Even Andromeda wasn't recognised as anything special - the proper name was 'The Great Nebula in Andromeda' up until recently, that being the name of the constellation where it is found.

It seems that the explanation is either non-mythological or else the plural is a clumsy error - the latter seems unlikely given the importance in the game of the subject matter..
