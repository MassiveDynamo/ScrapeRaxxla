There’s another possibility. I think everyone so far has assumed “Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars” refers to the “Astrophel and Stella” sonnets by Philip Sydney, however it might also be an association instead of a single entity, i.e. “Princess Astrophel” and “The Spiralling Stars”. Someone recently posted that they thought the earlier clue pointed towards the Maia region, and of course that is now in the Thargoid area of influence. What if the “Spiralling Stars” part of this refers to the display in a Thargoid Structure?

I think who Princess Astrophel is, determines what the spiraling stars are. They are 'together' in the meaning.

If the Princess is Vega that loves Altair, then the spiraling stars are the Milky way.

If the chilenerens book is a reversed gender version of the poem, I would guess the spiraling stars are twin black holes or twin neutron stars. Something black but radiant.

The thargoid structure fits well with the mother analogy. Thargoid(queens?) are typical virgin mothers, that creates the hive or omphalos.

Andromeda could be a Princess Astrophel, as she loved Perseus, a neighboring constellation. Both spiraling around Polaris.

Even planets were considered stars in classical times, making Venus/Aphrodite a possible candidate. She loved a lot of figures in the sky. This would probably point to the spindle of Necessity and the classical cosmos model as the spiraling stars.

There are many options. The challenge is to find the option that fits all the clues in a consistent way.

Who is the mother of galaxies?
Who is Princess Astrophel?
What kind of Omphalos?

What about Cora and Art Tornquist(thorny twig)? Do they hint to Phersephone and Atremis? Both sharing the mother goddess archetype and sometimes considered sisters(by Zeus and Demeter). Is it just the date that is important?
