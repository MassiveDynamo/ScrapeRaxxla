When we talk about Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling stars...why do we insist on it relating to a real life book?

Did you know that a star lover found some spiralling stars, and called it 'Caroline's Rose'?

Happens to be in the Cassiopeia Constellation relative to Sol as well. And in the general direction of her 'brow' depending on which drawing you use.
