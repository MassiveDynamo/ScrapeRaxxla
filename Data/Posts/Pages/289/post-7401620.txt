The Lovers Woe may pertain to Zhinu and Vega. Star-crossed lovers Zhinu – represented by the star Vega in the constellation Lyra – and a humble farm boy, Niulang, represented by the star Altair in Aquila.
just a thought i have been combing this thread for 3 days now chasing leads. Going to check this out tonight.

I've seen that several posters have made good point about Vega and Lyra. I think the strongest point is the 'Princess Astrophel and the Spiraling Stars'.

Princess star lover and the spiraling stars, seem to fit well with the story of "The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cowherd_and_the_Weaver_Girl

Even more so with the Japanese version of the story: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanabata

Where Princess Orihime(Vega) loves Hikoboshi(Altair) and they are separated by the River(Milky Way).

Orihime is the daughter of the Tentei, who is the Sky King or the universe itself.
Hikoboshi means 'Cowherd Star, or literally Boy Star'.

Lyra itself is the lyre of Orpheus. Orpheus was one of Jason's Argonauts and his music was able to quell the voices of the dangerous Sirens.

There may also be a Mother of Galaxies link to Lyra. The Arabs knew Lyra as a Vulture or Eagle.

The Egyptian goddess 'Mut', which literally means mother and is the basis for word in many European languages, is usually depicted with a Vulture on her forehead.
Some of Mut's many titles included World-Mother, Eye of Ra, Queen of the Goddesses, Lady of Heaven, Mother of the Gods, and She Who Gives Birth, But Was Herself Not Born of Any.

Lyra is certainly worth some deeper investigation.

Edit: Vega was of course also the North Pole star, around 12000 BC. That should qualify it as a propper Omphalos candidate, as well.
