One thing that struck me (and I realise I may be taking an overly simplistic view here) is the reference to spiralling stars.
Seems to me to be describing a Neutron star. Everytime I have done a boost it's like the view from inside a washing machine, so I was wondering about this being a more obvious clue than some of the others.

English is not my native language but I had that impression that “spiralling stars” refers to multiple stars moving in a way so that creates a spiralling shape. It’s just our home, Milky Way imho or something else representing a spiral galaxy, like the Thargoid Map. Also it’s just a children’s book and I believe most of the referances will make sense once the story unfolds.
