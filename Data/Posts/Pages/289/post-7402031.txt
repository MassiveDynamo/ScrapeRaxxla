When we talk about Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling stars...why do we insist on it relating to a real life book?

Did you know that a star lover found some spiralling stars, and called it 'Caroline's Rose'?

Happens to be in the Cassiopeia Constellation relative to Sol as well. And in the general direction of her 'brow' depending on which drawing you use.

It’s been addressed before and nothing came out as far as I know. My anti-thesis on this is that the in game book is for children, that said irl book is a solid scientific research. I see no similarities in between but yeah, that’s just me. Maybe there are some data links or crashed ship containing few chapters of this in-game book.
