True!

Han_Zen mentioned it above before I could say it (going to anyway ) but “Princess Astrophel” could represent a Thargoid:
since they are all female (I believe)
a princess is a young queen, and queen insects lay eggs, and there are eggs in the Thargoid structures which show the ‘spiralling stars’ .

In conjunction with the possible Maia solution to the earlier clue (who posted that? Can’t find it) then it is suggestive.

Or the Thargoid may have similar mythology. The are an old species. They could have watced the formation of the Pleiades ‘live’. Perhaps it was something special, that made them build monuments all around it?
