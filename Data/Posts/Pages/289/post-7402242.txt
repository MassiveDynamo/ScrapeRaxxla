On the other hand, we don’t know what Raxxla is in ED, so we don’t know what capabilities it offers (if any) to anyone who can access it!
True!

I suspect you are right in that the Club comprise a group of powerful characters that we hear of often in galnet articles and have no access to Raxxla, but we don’t have any canon source that says Raxxla is inhabited.
Also true. (Though just to clarify, although all of the Club have featured in Galnet, there's nothing to say we hear of all of them often via Galnet.)

However I also think Raxxla is a hidden station that will turn out to have no special capabilities. It might be an alien construction, but I’m not expecting it to be end-game or a super SD.
Hmm... Maybe there is something there but it isn't active and it's not known how to activate it, with all the rumours beings based on things which indicate what the construct should do when active. Which would actually fit pretty well with it being very closely guarded, but with little sign of what might be expected from the use of the construct. <Wild speculation ends>
