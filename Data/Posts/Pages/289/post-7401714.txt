One thing that struck me (and I realise I may be taking an overly simplistic view here) is the reference to spiralling stars.
Seems to me to be describing a Neutron star. Everytime I have done a boost it's like the view from inside a washing machine, so I was wondering about this being a more obvious clue than some of the others.

There’s another possibility. I think everyone so far has assumed “Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars” refers to the “Astrophel and Stella” sonnets by Philip Sydney, however it might also be an association instead of a single entity, i.e. “Princess Astrophel” and “The Spiralling Stars”. Someone recently posted that they thought the earlier clue pointed towards the Maia region, and of course that is now in the Thargoid area of influence. What if the “Spiralling Stars” part of this refers to the display in a Thargoid Structure?
