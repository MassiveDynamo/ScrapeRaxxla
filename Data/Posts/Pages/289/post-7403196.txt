I don’t know where to find the source of this but a while back now, when questioned about Raxxla, frontier said that one person had been in the system at some point?

If that was said and someone can confirm I’m not just chatting rubbish, then surely Raxxla wouldn’t be as close to the bubble as we think?

I get that space is huge and all that but still, if only one person at that time had jumped into the system and jumped out, we should probably be setting our eyes a Tiny bit further out of the bubble

There might still be clues and things around the bubble but the end destination probably won’t be.

This is one of those self-perpetuating myths that has absolutely no proof whatsoever - there has been no claim from Frontier that this is the case nor any link or internet reference to a forum or video that supports this.
