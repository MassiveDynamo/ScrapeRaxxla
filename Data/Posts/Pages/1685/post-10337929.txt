I still think that means the name of the system containing Raxxla/Omphalos Rift is a sub anagram of "Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars"
Given the capitalised letters spell "PASS" that sort of thing is possible.

If you expect it to be pointed directly at a system name that could narrow the search down to the (extremely large!) number of systems named of the form "<one word region name beginning with P> AS-S ..." e.g. Phylucs AS-S b17-1.
