Remember that the Alliance has grown from just over 200 systems originally to 1277 now, and other faction control will also have changed in the meantime.

Both SNG's Alliance factions are non-native ones which have expanded in - looking at the native factions it will originally have been either Federal or Independent

In Azaleach, Galnet 4 Feb 3302 and 27 April 3302 has the CGs being conducted by the Azaleach Partnership, which suggests that the system was probably under Federal control at the time as well. (From memory I'm fairly sure it was Federal when Halsey was doing her tour)
Yes, think you're correct there..and you read my mind. Was wondering what the extent of Alliance space was in 3301!
