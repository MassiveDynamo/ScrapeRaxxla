Given the capitalised letters spell "PASS" that sort of thing is possible.

If you expect it to be pointed directly at a system name that could narrow the search down to the (extremely large!) number of systems named of the form "<one word region name beginning with P> AS-S ..." e.g. Phylucs AS-S b17-1.
If you go down that rabbit hole you could also take "with eyes to see" literally. There are plenty of system names that spell out "Raxxla" (although all known ones are far away from the bubble).
