You could see it that way. There is also the opposite argument. Raxxla is an old mystery. Far older than the timeline of the games. If those that originally found Raxxla named planets or systems to act as a map or 'waypoints', it would be strange if those names only appears over the last 50 years.
Sure - but well over 95% of the named systems in Elite Dangerous weren't in the older games at all (and conversely many of the non-catalogue systems in the older games aren't in Elite Dangerous), so their names can certainly be more than 50 years old in-universe.

Similarly a lot of the internals of the systems which are in common - even lore-significant or prominent ones - have been changed between FE2 and Elite Dangerous either partly or entirely.
