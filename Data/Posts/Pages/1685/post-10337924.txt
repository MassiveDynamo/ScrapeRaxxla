Does that tie in at all with @Rochester 's Milton cosmology theory?
Just wondered if MB's apparent antipathy to the Alliance was another hint- might work if the Alliance region matched with Milton's Chaos/Hell

I believe it does. I was waiting for someone else to highlight this first.

Yes in this concept the bubble is an elongated blob, if you apply my cosmology over the top it effectively shifts the axis, although I also suppose Brookes may have been employing a tiered construction.

So red is at the base (Hell) blue at the centre (Chaos) and green towards the top (order / Empyrean).

I believe this correlates also with the shape of Yggdrasil, not just Miltonâ€™s cosmology. But yes it correlates.

All of this in my opinion continues to establish the enormity of Brookes work. The construction is breathtaking, I would not be surprised if it is as much part of Raxxla - not just a map towards its location, and very likely is what the codex alludes to as; the state of cosmic enlightenment!
