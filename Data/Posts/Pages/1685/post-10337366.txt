Though one has to be slightly careful about analysing names inherited from FE2/FFE that way - they may have been incorporated into the puzzle, and they certainly had quite a bit of choice over which FE2/FFE systems and stations to inherit, but they potentially have slightly different standing to ones that first appeared in ED.
You could see it that way. There is also the opposite argument. Raxxla is an old mystery. Far older than the timeline of the games. If those that originally found Raxxla named planets or systems to act as a map or 'waypoints', it would be strange if those names only appears over the last 50 years.
