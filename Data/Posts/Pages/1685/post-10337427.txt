I've just started building a model of the bubble in Blender, to visualize patterns across mythologies/motifs/sectors myself.

For performance reasons it's restricted to the named systems, so not even those from the HD / HIP / Gliese et al. catalogs are present. And there's still the issue of learning Blender in the first place.
Named-systems-only suits the subanagram hypothesis.
