Flying around last night and decided to re-visit the gen ship Thetis.

I have 2 accounts. A PC archived account and my current PS5 account (PC is dead - console was a present). So I realised I had never gone to the Thetis on console…

So it’s an unexplored system on my second account; normal signal scan initiated and boom up it pops.

I recall all the faff we used to employ to find these things via number stations. And I just recalled Brookes dissatisfaction with the max range scanner and how easy it made everything.

I just hope if we find Raxxla it’s actually called Raxxla and not Quagarrs. Otherwise I think we’re likely to just ignore it along with all other things?
