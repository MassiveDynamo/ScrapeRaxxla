was reading through this thread tonight and found this comment interesting. I've been listening to ice planets with geological/biological formations, a specific line "come speak to me" comes out clearly but the rest is garbled around noise. I haven't yet figured out what that is related to but your comment seemed related to my curiosity about what that transmission might be. I noticed that I hear "come speak to me" on any ice planet with geysers even those with atmospheres. I noticed it first when I was out near the rim and it got me so curios I started fixating on it. Tried to leave it alone for a while thinking I was just hearing things but having started exploring again I've noticed it once more. I am going to find some other types of planets ,rocky metal etc and see if they also say something or add to the line I'm hearing. It had not occurred to me that it might relate to raxxla but I will post more details if I find any thing new.
How do I speak to a planet?

With a very large megaphone!
