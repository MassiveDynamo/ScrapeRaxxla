Installation probably a bug, friend in Colonia has one on their Nav Panel with no name but can still be targeted and flown to, just says unauthorised when you get there iirc, no name of it at all anywhere, so put it down to bugs.



Sounds a lot like the Engineers huh? Been thinking for a while that they are the DW. Felicity refers to DW in Codex as being real (only one who actually does rather than say theyre a myth), names like Turner & Jameson imply certain heritage and Ryder is a direct link. Quite a few have to go through nefarious contacts to access, the others require a test of 'skill' in various roles - combat, trade, smuggling, explo. Cant quite make their bases into a wheel on the GalMap though....

Except Jorki is allied with all of them (except t’ young lass that recently appeared & is Palin’s sacrificial offering to t’thargoids (who’s the nearest engineer to Col 70?)), has been for a long time and never got any mission or been offered any other test from them. But yes, that is another example of the in-game test mechanism. So there is a test for engineer acceptance, there may be a similar test for the mysterious Elite Federation of Pilots, and we hope for
a similar test for TRDW so we can get some hints as to Raxxla’s location.
