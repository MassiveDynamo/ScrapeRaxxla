Except Jorki is allied with all of them (except t’ young lass that recently appeared & is Palin’s sacrificial offering to t’thargoids (who’s the nearest engineer to Col 70?)), has been for a long time and never got any mission or been offered any other test from them. But yes, that is another example of the in-game test mechanism. So there is a test for engineer acceptance, there may be a similar test for the mysterious Elite Federation of Pilots, and we hope for
a similar test for TRDW so we can get some hints as to Raxxla’s location.
You mean Chloe Sedesi, the Palin clone engineer in Witch Head Sector DL-Y d17 (closest to Col 70)?
I'd like to think FDev are going to add cut-scenes for the engineers inviting you to visit, maybe one day...
