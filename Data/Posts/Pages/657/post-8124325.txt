Just finished 'And Here The Wheel' , there is a part where they navigate and asteroid belt using visual clues on certain asteroids that point the way to Smuggler's Junction, which was an asteroid base. I seems like a cool way to hide something that couldtve been incorporated into the game. I feel like i remember possibly DB saying you don't know what you might find in an asteroid belt. Pretty sure the vid was posted in this thread but i have no idea who posted it.
Uncle Brabes said similar things about nebulae, but alas I don't recall when or where either. Dev diaries?
