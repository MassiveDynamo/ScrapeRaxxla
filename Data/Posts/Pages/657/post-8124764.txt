Ok, listened to DBOBE’s talk at Malmo again. Still not quite sure what he was getting at with the defaced ensign bit, sounds like he went off on a bit of a tangent. If I recall correctly back in the Olden Days of Sail the Royal Navy had three fleets Red, White & Blue, each with their own admiral and appropriately coloured ensign. Nowadays a Blue Ensign defaced with a crown is authorised for use by several British yacht clubs, but a White ensign is reserved for RN ships and RN/Royal Marine shore establishments.

The interesting thing is that the EFP are supposedly a group within the PF (to which we all automatically belong as ED pilots) & they can invite people to join them after a test of some kind. Those candidates will be primarily Elite, but also Dangerous and Deadly ranks may be tested and invited (hence this is talking only about Combat play). He implied the EFP can then make that lower rank up to Elite to reduce the time it takes to get Combat Elite. Has anyone come across this gameplay? I suspect Han_Zen is correct and this mechanism was scrapped in favour of the Founder’s World permit to Shin Dez. The one thing that makes me pause here is the realisation that within Shin Dez Lori Jameson will befriend Dangerous, Deadly and Elite combateers, so perhaps there is a test for EFP via her? Either way I don‘t think it’s anything related to TRDW or Raxxla.

May have been reference to various naval forces employing privateers, maybe false flags / pirates?
Agreed re Lori and no, I haven't seen a way to get in SD without Founder or Elite (Trade in my case).
