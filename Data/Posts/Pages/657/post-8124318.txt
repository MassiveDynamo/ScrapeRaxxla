I'm assuming this is nothing new. But do the new surface deposits usually look this thargoid. I usually only do fissures. And not usually up close. I was exploreing and looking in asteroids because of the other thread. Couldn't remember if this is a normal look and can't find any good pics online.

I could actually see this from a pretty good distance away. As in multiple asteroids away. Not what I normally think of as a normal asteroid deposit.


Don't have stuff to scan it on me.

Just finished 'And Here The Wheel' , there is a part where they navigate and asteroid belt using visual clues on certain asteroids that point the way to Smuggler's Junction, which was an asteroid base. I seems like a cool way to hide something that couldtve been incorporated into the game. I feel like i remember possibly DB saying you don't know what you might find in an asteroid belt. Pretty sure the vid was posted in this thread but i have no idea who posted it.
