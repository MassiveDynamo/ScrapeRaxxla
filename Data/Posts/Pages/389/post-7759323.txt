Player named. So...


Or the "obfuscation" if it's Raxxla's system ? Or class star X (=exotic) symbol ?
Asteroid belts symbols look slightly diferent, imho.
Okay sweet Thank you wasn't aware of it being player made edsm doesn't mention this at all on the site. Nor is there information that this was player named. Thanks for the heads up.

I figure it was referencing Maia one of the 7 sister's of the Pleiades
