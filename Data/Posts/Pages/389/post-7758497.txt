Curious observation: "To the whisperer in witch-space, the siren of the deepest void!"
In the Formidine Rift Alpha mission, one of the crew talks about both a siren song and some weird voices during his jump/time spent in witch-space.
I really think you’re onto something here. That Alpha mission text also mentions the void, in addition to what you said. I think it’s likely that a clue is located out there, possibly a clue that’s during a specific hyperspace jump in that area. There does seem to be whispering sounds during hyperspace jumps, but who is recording them? Are they all the same? Is there a possibility that the “whisper” changes somewhere in the Formadine Rift?
