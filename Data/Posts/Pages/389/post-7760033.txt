Do we have a master list of systems with eight moons orbiting gas giants? I have one to cross off - Flyeia Dryoae BM-K d9-34 B 3 H - nothing apparent from scans and flying in orbit.

Edit: Although the moon itself isn't uninteresting...

Now there is a name I haven't seen for some time. He lives! ;-)

Now all we need is Luke, Zach, Zoltan, Arc, and a few others to show up and the original band will be back together.
