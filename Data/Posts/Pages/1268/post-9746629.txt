If the Dark Wheel toast were to refer to commodities (I don't want you to believe it, but just imagine 2 minutes), what could it be? My knowledge of the commodities is very limited, I would appreciate a little help.
For the jewels that shine on the forehead of the mother of all galaxies!
Mother of all galaxies = nothingness, void
void jewels = Void Opal [Mining]
For the one who whispers in the confines of hyperspace, the siren of nothingness!
Thargoid whispers in the confines of hyperspace. Thargoid heart? [Combat]
The mourning of a parent, the sadness of a lover,
Sadness = tears = water.
Mourning = death = memorial
Shintara water, Rare at Jameson Memorial [Trading]
The desire of our wandering hearts (+fernweh)
Travel, exploration, desire elsewhere, discovery, treasure hunt. An item representative of Dark Wheel's vocation. Or linked to The Dark Wheel.
[Exploration thing?]
