Not convinced by your hypothesis re Alleged Toast= commodities,
but intrigued by the hypothesis that "Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars" implies Thargoids (they're all female & young queen insects might be princesses) and the Thargoid Base machine display does show spiralling stars. Think someone else has mooted this hypothesis before but can't remember who or if anyone investigated.
It would mean that this is MB's "We did look at a story involving Raxxla, but felt that was a story that should be played out in game rather than as a novel‚Äù- Raxxla may be intimately connected (stop sniggering at the back there!) with the Thargoid/Guardian storyline. We know that Raxxla is part of the Alien Background lore document.

Has anyone checked to see if all these machine displays are identical??
