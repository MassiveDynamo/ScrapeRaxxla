DW is in no position to confirm Raxxla's existance in the game.


"The system Raxxla is in was visited" claim thingy: https://m.twitch.tv/clip/SnappyScaryMousePupper

Other than those anonymous "I heard that someone heard that someone said that someone heard" chains.
Sure, technically he's not a developer, but he was a main story writer, hugely dedicated player, and also controlled the NPC Salome (in case you didnt know.... Drews stories directly effected Salome and visa versa, he has said so directly himself, right upto and including her death).....

So it's a fair assumption that if he was told directly by MB/DB, or anyone at fdev, that it is in game, told to his face, than YES, he is in a position to confirm that to us!

Also, there have been several times where MB/DB (I can honestly never remember which) have directly said it THEMSELVES in interviews, that Raxxla is IN GAME, so again, YES, Drew is in a position to confirm that to the best of his knowledge, yes it is in fact in game.

If you believe he's not, then that's your choice, but the facts are the facts in this case and can't be twisted, they are what they are.
Google the MB/DB interviews and see for yourself.

Anyways.... Drew is a heck of a lot more trustworthy than they player who claims to have overheard the system was visited at Lave Con. That's someone claiming to over hear someone else's convo, thats second hand information at best. Drew had direct conversation and then directly told us, first hand information, much more trustworthy.

Addon: I don't mean to call anyone else's statements untrue either, I'm just saying in order or trustworthiness of comments, it goes Fdev, MB/DB directly, Drew Wagar, everyone else
