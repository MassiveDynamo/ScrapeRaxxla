I doubt that Polaris has any connection to Raxxla. Polaris is most likely just part of the Thargoid story.

That being said, there are plenty of hints that fit Polaris:

Polaris is an Ophalos point.
Polaris is the centre of the spiralling stars of the night sky, in the northern hemisphere of earth.
Polaris did have a portal in FFE, that lead to the Thargoid universe (Miackce, possibly the same as COL 70 sector fy-n c21-3).

This is all nice. It would however feel a bit silly to me to find out I visited Raxxla in FFE, without knowing it.

A bit silly yes but then would that also make the existence of Raxxla in the older game truth and it was in the game after all we just didnt get to explore it
