If the Dark Wheel toast were to refer to commodities (I don't want you to believe it, but just imagine 2 minutes), what could it be? My knowledge of the commodities is very limited, I would appreciate a little help.
For the jewels that shine on the forehead of the mother of all galaxies!
Mother of all galaxies = nothingness, void
void jewels = Void Opal [Mining]
For the one who whispers in the confines of hyperspace, the siren of nothingness!

I've been out of Elite for a while, been back a week, and looking for mysteries, I re-read the Raxxla Toast to see if I could get back into the search for mysteries to solve in ED.

I always took 'The Toast' to be a a 'meta-statement' about the act of playing a video game:

"the parents grief, the lovers woe", "Omphalos Rift", aside its historical/mythological connections sounds like a riff on 'Occulus Rift', and all that stuff about being a portal to other realities/dimensions and so on.

The (real) Omphalos Stone was 'the Navel of the World' and the Raxxla symbol looks like the structures you can see at the far end of the docking bay when entering a station. The Stations navel, perhaps?

What if people have said Raxxla is 'in' the game, because Raxxla IS the game?

I know, I know, it's probably been said a million times before, I just had to get it out of my system and I'm not reading 1200 pages of replies to find that out ;D

When thinking in less Meta-terms about it though, I always come back to the Omphalos (stone), Delphi, and the Thargoids. Maybe I'll start exploring that again.
