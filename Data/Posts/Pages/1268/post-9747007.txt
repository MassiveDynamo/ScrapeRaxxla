Is a link to Drew saying in no uncertain terms, Raxxla is IN GAME and fdev knows where it is.
Point blank.

Sure this mean just a reference to the codex entry, but look at Drews face and listen to his tone. He whole-heartedly believes it exists ingame in some accessible format.

i really dont think hed have been allowed to walk away from that conversation believing that if it wasnt true. He was a close friend and I doubt they'd lied flat out to him.


Anyways, all conjecture, let's move on with our assumptions again XD in Polaris not in Polaris, until someone gets into Polaris, next topic please

DW is in no position to confirm Raxxla's existance in the game.


"The system Raxxla is in was visited" claim thingy: https://m.twitch.tv/clip/SnappyScaryMousePupper

Other than those anonymous "I heard that someone heard that someone said that someone heard" chains.
