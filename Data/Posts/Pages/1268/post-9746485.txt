Though I will say, I like that I got a conversation going again, last few weeks been kinda quite with just small bursts of light comments lol....

But if someone can give me evidence that Polaris is hiding somthing to do with DW/Raxxla, im more than willing to listen, but so far there isn't ANY that I'm aware of point us to Polairs for this story arch...

There's evidence of Polaris having Thargoid history/connections, but not DW/raxxla... (and yes I get it, DW/raxxla and thargoids could also be connected, blah blah blah, show me some hard proof of that, not just conjecture)
I doubt that Polaris has any connection to Raxxla. Polaris is most likely just part of the Thargoid story.

That being said, there are plenty of hints that fit Polaris:

Polaris is an Ophalos point.
Polaris is the centre of the spiralling stars of the night sky, in the northern hemisphere of earth.
Polaris did have a portal in FFE, that lead to the Thargoid universe (Miackce, possibly the same as COL 70 sector fy-n c21-3).

This is all nice. It would however feel a bit silly to me to find out I visited Raxxla in FFE, without knowing it.
