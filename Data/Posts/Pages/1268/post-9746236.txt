Hello Dear Cmdrs.

I seek to demystify like you the quest for Raxxla. I would like to report the facts that I was able to identify as well as some associations of ideas. You will see that the approach is quite different from what I have read here. I had no desire to rush headlong to analyze many systems (too lazy for that) without even knowing what I was looking for. So I wanted not to search by brute force, but rather to reconstruct the myth of Raxxla, where it comes from.

And this quest is more of an archaeological investigation quest than a fierce exploration of space.

Attention Cmdr, these ideas give a general plan until you find Raxxla. Very few things are missing, but they are crucial things.. And uses all the paragraphs of the codex.

If you don't want to know and find out for yourself, look no further.

Below are my notes, translated from French by Google. => Keep an open mind

SPOILER: RAXXLA




















SPOILER: THE OMPHALOS RIFT














SPOILER: THE RIFT RITUAL





























SPOILER: THE ROAD TO RAXXLA







SPOILER: IS THERE A BUG?










Pour Raxxla !
