"[2+4+9] => [17] The clue is probably within reasonable range in the human bubble."

There is hypothesis you have to consider: The clue is probably within resonable range in the human bubble at specific time.
Some people, me including, think that Raxxla is not static: it's moving through different systems and was very close to Sol around 2296.
Since then, we don't know how many time do we have to wait for Raxxla to comes back again near Sol.
Until then, Raxxla is moving and could be found in any system in the game (400 billions systems, IF it stays in milky way ).
This association of ideas "[2+4+9] => [17]" is more of a side commentary to ensure the consistency of the whole story. The clue is contained at Delphi 5A (see [29]), which seems at a reasonable distance from the human bubble.

Regarding the mobility of Raxxla: There is no reason to claim this. I'm only using game information, I don't claim anything. However, "[1] The nature of Raxxla is unknown. (Codex)" implies that it may be mobile. Or not. In both cases, the Rift Ritual must make it possible to find it at the moment where it is currently. If the rift points to an old Raxxla location, then there must be a clue at that location to find the new one.
