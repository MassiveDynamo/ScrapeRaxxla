Brandy helps, as do chocolate biscuits!

The only thing that is outstanding in my mind is MB’s statement that they considered another book about Raxxla, to follow on from Holdstock’s The Dark Wheel, but thought it would be better played out as a storyline in-game. That is hugely significant, it implies Raxxla exists, can be found, there are clues to its location. However where is that storyline? Ive followed the “Princess” hypothesis out to Colonia, Ive looked in Shinrarta (Holdstock’s “you have to be Elite”), I’ve flown thousands of light years tracking down possibilities from the Alleged Toast...I can’t see any other hints of a “storyline” in-game since the original TDW missions from Jameson were removed.
Maybe a condition to unlock something specific is to carry both trinkets of hidden fortune and either guardian relic or SAP8 core container (which is a guardian relic fragments).
I never done TDW missions but i saw what they needed us to find. Clue?
