Some Lovecraftian references for Jorki Was fun - I havent looked at lovcraft since the MB days and was interesting to see if there were any parallels to the toast.

We have the dreaded page 751 of the Necronomicon which i wll only give some salient quotes as to not incur any more madness.
SPOILER: YOG-SOTHOTH

And from "The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadeth" after finally finding Kadeth (empty) Randolph Carter is being taken from the city by Nyarlathrotep the Crawling Chaos to Azathoth. (more snippets)
SPOILER: AZATHOTH




hmm looks like the content filters dont like one of the words oh well.
Oh and a last bit on Azathoth from Dreams in the Witch House "...he had read in the Necronomicon about the mindless entity Azathoth, which rules all time and space from a curiously environed black throne at the center of Chaos."
