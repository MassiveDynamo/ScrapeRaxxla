Ya I tried finding just Lovecraftian references... The dragon thing in the bottom right is Cuthulu i think but there are some obvious things like the tree of life and harpies and charon that are norse greek myth... could be part of MBs version. Found a decent list of lovecraft gods and descriptions here:
Cthulhu Mythos deities - Wikipedia
en.m.wikipedia.org

Edit.. Ahhh his book is Lovecraft and Milton... Its the tree of knowledge and the apple and the snake the fall of man...
Hmmm no apples and the leaves dont look right... Meh

Think itâ€™s the Tree of Life rather then the Tree of Knowledge. Former gave immortality, the latter knowledge of good & evil. Eve ate the Cox instead of the Pippin!
