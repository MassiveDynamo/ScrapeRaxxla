Interesting, well done! Though think you may be wrong on 16, that angel definitely looks female to me; Archangel Michael might fit #10 instead? And I preferred Yog Sothoth instead of Hades-just because it fits “the lock that is also the key” line!
Anybody else got more ideas? It’s a strange mixture of Cthulhu and Norse mythology. Pity I can’t find the book, would have got it for my son’s Xmas present. Anybody read MB’s The Third Path trilogy?
