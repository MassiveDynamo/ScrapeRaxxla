So Yog-Sothoth is the gate, and the key and guardian of the gate (@Scytale: “door that is also the key” sound familiar?); presumably that’s him top left in the tattoo? Then below him is Charon rowing his boat on the river. My son tells me Cthulhu is the tentacled dragon bottom right. Assume the pic is all about chaos, but cant see any “curiously environed black throne at the center”. Tree of life in the centre? Presumably gates of paradise top right? Don’t understand anything else!
Ya I tried finding just Lovecraftian references... The dragon thing in the bottom right is Cuthulu i think but there are some obvious things like the tree of life and harpies and charon that are norse greek myth... could be part of MBs version. Found a decent list of lovecraft gods and descriptions here:
Cthulhu Mythos deities - Wikipedia
en.m.wikipedia.org

Edit.. Ahhh his book is Lovecraft and Milton... Its the tree of knowledge and the apple and the snake the fall of man...
Paradise Lost - Wikipedia
en.m.wikipedia.org
Hmmm no apples and the leaves dont look right... Meh
