Interesting, well done! Though think you may be wrong on 16, that angel definitely looks female to me; Archangel Michael might fit #10 instead? And I preferred Yog Sothoth instead of Hades-just because it fits “the lock that is also the key” line!
Anybody else got more ideas? It’s a strange mixture of Cthulhu and Norse mythology. Pity I can’t find the book, would have got it for my son’s Xmas present. Anybody read MB’s The Third Path trilogy?
As this is ED, not Prison Break....do we really think MB tattooed a map to Raxxla on his back?
