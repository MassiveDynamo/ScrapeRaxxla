Some Lovecraftian references for Jorki Was fun - I havent looked at lovcraft since the MB days and was interesting to see if there were any parallels to the toast.

We have the dreaded page 751 of the Necronomicon which i wll only give some salient quotes as to not incur any more madness.
SPOILER: YOG-SOTHOTH

And from "The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadeth" after finally finding Kadeth (empty) Randolph Carter is being taken from the city by Nyarlathrotep the Crawling Chaos to Azathoth. (more snippets)




hmm looks like the content filters dont like one of the words oh well.
Oh and a last bit on Azathoth from "...he had read in the Necronomicon about the mindless entity Azathoth, which rules all time and space from a curiously environed black throne at the center of Chaos."
Click to expand...

So Yog-Sothoth is the gate, and the key and guardian of the gate (@Scytale: “door that is also the key” sound familiar?); presumably that’s him top left in the tattoo? Then below him is Charon rowing his boat on the river. My son tells me Cthulhu is the tentacled dragon bottom right. Assume the pic is all about chaos, but cant see any “curiously environed black throne at the center”. Tree of life in the centre? Presumably gates of paradise top right? Don’t understand anything else!
