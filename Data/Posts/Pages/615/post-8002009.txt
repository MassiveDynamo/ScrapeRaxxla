Discussing the sex of the Angels, Pa ? Please, do know that they haven't, you heretic Brit !! . Besides the flamigera sword. Definitely St Michael (Brookes ?).
Hades is right at his place as King of The Underworld. Not really mixed, as upper left quadrant is Greek, center is Norse, lower right Lovecraftian, upper right is Christian or... what?

Ofc not. But showing off such a monstrous tattoo might very well inform us about what the person is fan of. Which in the case of MB could be very interesting. It's like... espionnage ?

This.
A series about a guy who had his body tattoed with all the information, maps, clues, etc.. he will later need to escape from the prison he was about to enter. Great series !
Might have inspired MB... up to a point ?

Mm, far-fetched plot device! he would have to carry a mirror (actually two, large) to see what’s tattooed on his back! That would be awkward in the escape tunnel!

Disagree, the angelic being (sexless or otherwise) at #16 has no sword so can’t be Archangel Michael (and in the distant past I dated a couple of angels who were definitely female ; also a few harpies! ) . #10 has a spear, as does the one to the left at #9, though the two to the upper right at #9 do have swords. I’d go for the larger one as Michael.
