As this is ED, not Prison Break....do we really think MB tattooed a map to Raxxla on his back?

I’m just interested in his way of thinking; that might be relevant

But actually now Scytale’s got me into this I’m also interested, in an abstract way, in the mythology and symbology he’s used here. It seems strange to me to mix Cthulhu mythology (invented by Lovecraft) with ancient Norse mythology.
(Edit: and don’t know if any other thread has discussed this. Don’t remember any detailed discussion like this back in the day in the UA mysteries thread where he revealed the tattoo)

P.S. what’s Prison Break?
