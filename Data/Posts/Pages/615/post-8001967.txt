Interesting, well done! Though think you may be wrong on 16, that angel definitely looks female to me; Archangel Michael might fit #10 instead? And I preferred Yog Sothoth instead of Hades-just because it fits “the lock that is also the key” line!
Discussing the sex of the Angels, Pa ? Please, do know that they haven't, you heretic Brit !! . Besides the flamigera sword. Definitely St Michael (Brookes ?).
Hades is right at his place as King of The Underworld. Not really mixed, as upper left quadrant is Greek, center is Norse, lower right Lovecraftian, upper right is Christian or... what?

As this is ED, not Prison Break....do we really think MB tattooed a map to Raxxla on his back?
Ofc not. But showing off such a monstrous tattoo might very well inform us about what the person is fan of. Which in the case of MB could be very interesting. It's like... espionnage ?

I’m just interested in his way of thinking; that might be relevant
P.S. what’s Prison Break?
This.
A series about a guy who had his body tattoed with all the information, maps, clues, etc.. he will later need to escape from the prison he was about to enter. Great series !
Might have inspired MB... up to a point ?

Think it’s the Tree of Life rather then the Tree of Knowledge. Former gave immortality, the latter knowledge of good & evil.
Pretty sure it's Yggdrasil.
(Yggdrasil from Old Norse Yggdrasill) is an immense mythical tree that plays a central role in Norse cosmology, where it connects the Nine Worlds. ) Like Raxxla ?
