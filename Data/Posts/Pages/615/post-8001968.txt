Cthulhu(Chthonic), Persephone/Cora, gates of Hades, valley of the shadow, cerberus, Sheol and so on, al point to the underworld. The realm of the dead.

In ED the therm ‘The Dead’ has been used as a direct reference to the Guardians.
Combined with the use of the word ‘construct’ both for Guardian AI and the Alien device on Raxxla, this makes it easy to think in that direction.

Halsey’s vision of the Caretakers that supposedly lead to Guardian ruins, is another connection.
