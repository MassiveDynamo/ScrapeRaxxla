I’m just interested in his way of thinking; that might be relevant

But actually now Scytale’s got me into this I’m also interested, in an abstract way, in the mythology and symbology he’s used here. It seems strange to me to mix Cthulhu mythology (invented by Lovecraft) with ancient Norse mythology.
(Edit: and don’t know if any other thread has discussed this. Don’t remember any detailed discussion like this back in the day in the UA mysteries thread where he revealed the tattoo)

P.S. what’s Prison Break?
Don't know how much the symbology used is MBs and how much is the artists (Luciana Nedelea). From MB's blog where he first shows the image, he does not say whether he commissioned the image of used one the artist had already done. Might all be from the artist without connection to anything else. MB says the image shows the line of his (as yet unwritten story) does not have to have any connection to ED.
