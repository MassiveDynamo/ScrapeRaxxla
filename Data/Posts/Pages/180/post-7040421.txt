What do you guys think? Or has this been brought up before?

You may add every "Ryder Revolutionnary Party" and similars which populate the Bubble.
Brought up before and even "fan fiction-ed". Page 18 (of the novel, 20 of the interface): https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1fwIZbNexwPRV9rXzlYSjlHRlE/edit
But don't be discouraged. You may succeed where others failed.
