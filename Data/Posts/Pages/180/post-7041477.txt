At this stage, I believe there is one hint.
When flying into the system, a special sound clip is played.
Simply put, if there is a lighthouse of one type, the ruins of another type, and so on.
If you systematize them by type, and understand what it refers to, then when you visit the system with Raxxla, it will be completely different from those that are (unique).
