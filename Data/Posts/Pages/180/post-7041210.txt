Has anybody heard of any files for Elite Dangerous that where listed as "Rouge Planet" and/or "star class X = exotic" from some forums from Fdev?

I believe someone looked at the Journal file format when it came out & that has object types that include those. But canâ€™t find my link to that journal spec. Should be googlable!
