I believe someone looked at the Journal file format when it came out & that has object types that include those. But canâ€™t find my link to that journal spec. Should be googlable!

I remember the exotic star class. The classes were listed in open text files in the beginning.

I can't remember any rouge planet, but that does not mean it's not there.

Rouge planets would be like any other planet in a system, except that they wouldn't orbit any star.
They could potentially switch systems, but this would be rare. Systems are big and planets move slow, so it wouldn't happen every Thursday morning. [big grin]
