On my way to several waypoints I have set... fun thing: "the core of the problem" I thought, maybe problem translates to maths... so I did some calculations considering coordinates...

Tonight I landed on a planet to take a break... this is what I found shortly after. Do note, this is over 15,000 light years away from Earth, and Colonia... I have no words and I seriously found no data points, no information. However one thing I know, this is creeping me out. And yes, after repairs I will be checking out the rest of the system and neighbouring systems.
