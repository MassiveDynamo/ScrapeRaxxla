Just had a thought Raxxla is supposed to be older than the galaxy so are we looking for a system with a star older than the galaxy ?? what is the age of this galaxy ?

About 486 millions years, I believe. At least, that's the age of Sag A* in game, but I believe 13,5 billion or something close like that is the age of the Milky Way.
