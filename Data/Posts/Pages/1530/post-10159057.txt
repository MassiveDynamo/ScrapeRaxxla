The logo might be meaningless but there was a special significance to getting triple elite from the beginning- I seem to remember a £10,000 prize to the first to reach that?

Yup:
The first Elite: Dangerous player to reach Triple Elite status gets £10K
Well, this is one way to encourage players to race through your endgame content.

though there have been many triple elites… no one seems to have noticed a difference… but ya as far as special achievements to unlock before getting an invite to the dark wheel … this is one of those possible hurdles…
As stated previously, Alex Ryder was not ELITE - he was Deadly. I have sincere doubts about rank being a prerequisite. This is all the more true factoring in membership is likely kept to key lineages. All members who received ships in Frontier and First Encounters were grandchildren at minimum of Peter Jameson. The connection is not the Ryders. It is the first ELITE CMDR, Peter Jameson. The test involved survival. A rank only means you passed a test. For example, traders and bounty hunters just due to nature of their work had to outfly and outgun pirates. Survival in dangerous fields and your age in dangerous fields speaks more to survival instincts.
