The Adamastor, the tree above hell, to the war and the bridge

The following image shows the locations of various systems groups, namely Yggdrasil, the path of Persephone (green), systems discovered upto 2296 (white), the underworld below (red), the path of Jacques and the location (and proximity/relative distance from Sol) of the Adamastor.



The second image is the cover illustration from Michael Brookes (RIP) un-published book and back tattoo.



Tin-foil hypotheses, is the image from the Brookes represented in game?

The positioning of the Yggdrasil systems do seem to hover over the systems representing the Underworld, similarly as does the tree of knowledge over Brookes version of some type of underworld or hell.

The Adamastor does seem to be in a relatively opposite distance and orientation to that of the path of Jacques, as does the image of Adamastor in Brookes image to that of heavens gate?

The path of Jacques does seem to journey around the Thargoid maelstroms (Brookes war of older gods) but notably this path also travels between two particular systems namely ‘Bridge’ and another which holds the Gen ship ‘Achlys’ the personified spirit of death.



Does this represent the path of Lucifer in Paradise Lost? from Pandemonium through Hells gate, towards Heavens gates?

In Paradise Lost, Lucifer wanders upon the outermost sphere (the outer rim). Is there something above ‘bridge’ in a relative position to that of the Adamastor!

One of the maelstroms is within such a relative opposite position to the Adamastor!

Collectively do these alignments mirror an abstract representation of those elements shown ultimately in Brookes image, if so where would heavens gate be located?
