While there is no Charon system in-game, we do have the moon Charon (of Pluto in Sol) which is landable and we have the system Charonium. Charon was the ferryman to the Underworld. Have those been checked? Additionally, the rivers of the underworld may need to factored in to determine how to get in there.
