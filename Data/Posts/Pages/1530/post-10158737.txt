There was a rumor that the game's main creator flies the Cobra Mk 3
Its still my fav ship to fly (yes even with the silly 'left hand drive') and its even more usable now in the current Thargoid climate, even with a D rated g3 Drag drive set of thrusters, it can easily outrun any space flower when you accidentally jump into one of their systems
