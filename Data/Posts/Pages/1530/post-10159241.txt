I have more bad news .. Teorge is not what is labelled Teorge. It is, however, very nearby and semi-obvious:

Brood mother? Greek? Incubating clusters? That meant that Elyssia Fields was from Teorge, the so-called 'clone-world'. Alex struggled to remember what he'd been taught about Teorge ... an inhabited world ... settled by two colony ships that had proceeded to clone a select few of the crew and colonists, killing the others. For centuries Teorge had been a world apart, cut off from the normal flow of trade and commerce, and banned from sending representatives into space.

The system labeled as Teorge has no inhabited worlds unless you somehow consider methane, argon, or helium breathable. The real Teorge is Lave which was settled by Colony Ships Hershel and Oberon. The Universe it seems is not lacking in a sense of irony. The cloneworld being Lave. Well, clearly The Club needed an army to defend what was found 116 years before Lave was colonized in 2412. Lave was one of a handful systems containing an Earth-like which did not require terraforming.
