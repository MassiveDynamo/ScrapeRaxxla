As stated previously, Alex Ryder was not ELITE - he was Deadly. I have sincere doubts about rank being a prerequisite.
'I've put you through your paces, Alex, you and Elyssia both. The Dark Wheel needs you. Both of you. But believe me, what you've just been through is nothing to what you face now. You've got to become elite, Alex. And that means a lot of training, and a lot of fighting, and maybe a lot of months, even years.
But then the Universe will open up before you in a way you never imagined possible.'

Ya he wasnt elite - but he wasnt accepted into the dark wheel yet either.
