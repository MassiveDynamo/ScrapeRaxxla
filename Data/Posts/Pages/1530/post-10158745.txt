In the old games there were only combat rank. It was a simple kill-count. One kill, one point.

In Elite the players don't have access to galactic maps. We see only the Galcop trade maps (8). In TDW Alex travels to Cirag, that is not on the Galnet maps. Manual jumps like that, was not possible for players (Cirag didn't exist in the game).

According to the old lore a Galcop pilot had to be Elite, to apply for full jump navigation. This was of course not available for players, even after becoming elite.

There are a bunch of details on Galcop bureaucracy in the book, Imprint: http://www.dream-ware.co.uk/elite/books/imprint/
I will have to read that. Thanks for the background. Also, the more I think about it the weirder it seems Pilot's licenses were only offered at Lave (actually pretty sure must be false as Mic Turner graduated elsewhere). This sounds like, in the case of Lave, someone actively seeking to create a personal space Navy.
