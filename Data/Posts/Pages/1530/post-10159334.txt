In the past there was much discussion on the tattoo representing a journey through ED, search back for Scytale’s posts on this.
At top left is the Triton statue from Portugal’s Peña Palace (& there is a Triton system in-game), lying above Charon the ferryman on the Styx.....there are lots of possible ED systems. But since Triton (Neptune’s moon) is permit locked we cannot start the journey from there, which is suspicious!

P.S.
We have always assumed it starts at top left and the joirney goes anticlockwise...what if it reverses that?
