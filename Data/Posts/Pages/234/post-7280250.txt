"For those with eyes to see" or something like this was the line about Raxxla earlier. Just some absolutely random fact about the animal 'eagle': " The eagle eye is among the strongest in the animal kingdom, with an eyesight estimated at 4 to 8 times stronger than that of the average human." -iPatrickDev on Reddit.

I see two scenarios here. One, following the lead previously suggested by Stonn Mrogg, heading to the Eagle nebulae to see what we can see - or perhaps the Eagle Eye is a reference to the program of the same name in Delphi, designed to locate Thargoids.

Furthermore, in Delphi there exists a Thargoid structure. Since Delphi is almost definitely related to the Raxxla story by viture of being the center of the 'world' in Greek mythology, and it is a hotspot for Thargoid activity, being Aegis' headquarters, can we assume the Thargoid/Guardian storylines and the Raxxla storylines are intertwined?

As for eagle nebula - there's a series of white-stars there (11 groups, placed on 11 planes from Sol), i get it how they are an artifact of how the galaxy forge works with real data, still they look even more strange, than cupid's arrow.
Have anyone tried already to draw those 11 separate planes with stars as dots on a plane, may something be coded there in plain sight? Like, some symbols, that could be decoded and point some other place?
