Well, I'm out at M17 SECTOR UJ-Z D16 where I estimate is halfway between the Aquila Dark Region and the Eagle Nebula. Now that I'm here...

What am I looking for? lol

I know it's all conjecture but I don't have anything good. Especially about what an Omphalos Rift should look like. Any good foil-covered ideas?

edit-

I guess more to say, should I be probin every body? Was there something about eight moons and ammonia I caught somewhere? I feel like the FSS by itself is gonna let me down maybe.
