I feel people were getting too close; FD underestimated peoples skill levels and they moved the goal posts.
Well the original goal-posts, from the time and state of game when teases were made about Raxxla being in-game and findable, would be a max of triple-Elite (CQC not launched yet), and nothing planetary (Horizons not launched yet).

Also remember Horizons is still an add-on, so base game players couldn't find Raxxla if it was needed, and the assumption is all CMDRs can find Raxxla, which again means no planetary stuff is required.
