Omphalos,
"An omphalos is a religious stone artifact, or baetylus. In Ancient Greek, the word ὀμφᾰλός (omphalós) means "navel". In Greek lore, Zeus sent two eagles across the world to meet at its center, the "navel" of the world."
Possibly implying it's an object. Fingers crossed the FSS does it's job and notifies when you find something as unique as this.

Rift,
/rift/
a crack, split, or break in something.
"the wind had torn open a rift in the clouds"
synonyms: crack, fault, flaw, split, break, breach, fissure, fracture, cleft, crevice, cavity, opening
"a deep rift in the ice"
