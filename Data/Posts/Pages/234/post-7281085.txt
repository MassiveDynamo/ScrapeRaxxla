Omphalos,
"An omphalos is a religious stone artifact, or baetylus. In Ancient Greek, the word ὀμφᾰλός (omphalós) means "navel". In Greek lore, Zeus sent two eagles across the world to meet at its center, the "navel" of the world."
Possibly implying it's an object. Fingers crossed the FSS does it's job and notifies when you find something as unique as this.

Rift,
/rift/
a crack, split, or break in something.
"the wind had torn open a rift in the clouds"
synonyms: crack, fault, flaw, split, break, breach, fissure, fracture, cleft, crevice, cavity, opening
"a deep rift in the ice"

I think there is quite a bit of omphalos symbolism in the Robotic Avian.
SPOILER

Small planet at the bottom, axis with up and down markers and a big winged creature at the top.

Aquila, Cygnus and Draco would be likely candidates as winged beasts of the sky.
