I been trying to think what FD may have installed for us upon discovering Raxxla? I think one possibility might be that this is the challenge the Dark Wheel have set us and this will be the trigger to their invite and not the other way around.
Iv'e been Admiral / King and triple Elite for longer than I can remember and was allied to the Dark Wheel a long time ago back in the days of Sap 8 missions and have never had a sniff of anything out of the ordinary.
Was a Kickstarter and still going strong to this day (thanks to VR) but I still think the path to Raxxla probably either starts in SOL or Shinrarta only because as far as I am aware those were the only 2 systems that FD ever put hand placed items in when the game was first brought into existence.

Fly safe CMDR Q!!!!
