i’ve been an elite dangerous commander for a while now, and I find the search for Raxxla very interesting. I’m curious as well. I’ve noticed a few references to movies, names on stations, Easter eggs, ect. Is there a station called Alexander Kerensky by any chance? I thought I’ve seen that name in the bubble somewhere. I’ve also noticed a reference to Arcadia. The information I might part with is based on Star League and the SLDF and their leader Alexander Kerensky. Gen. Kerensky was leading the SLDF from SOL (inner sphere) on an Exodus some 1300 light years distance and ended up at the Pentagon worlds. One of the worlds was called Arcadia. The five worlds are called Babylon, Eden, Circe, Dagda, and Arcadia. Raxxla has a pentagonal symbol right? I have a hunch they could be system names but I haven’t looked into it as of yet. Heh, just food for thought.

Good try, but the Raxxla icon is hexagonal..
