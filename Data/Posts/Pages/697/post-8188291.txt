On this, I'd like you to elaborate.
What about "the Old Systems"? Regular starter system and the few around it (Alpha/Beta transferrals)? Achenar? Alioth? All the rest of Federal/Imperial/Alliance/Independent systems more or less transferred from FE2/FFE? And all the catalogue stars?
What point in testing/releasse timetable you reckon "the game was first brought into existence"?

I wondered about the Old Worlds, but on Sunday while I was reading through the codex I checked their Wiki entries. Most were colonised after the first reported rumour of Raxxla. Together with the emphasis on them in the original game etc I think this decreases the liklihood Raxxla would be located there. Cant be conclusive though.

I do think the DW station is significant in the quest though, and I donâ€™t think the star types are correct for that.
