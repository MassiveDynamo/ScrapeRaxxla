I honestly don’t like my last one. Too weird for me haha. I’ll keep an eye out for more like it though.

I want concrete stuff, dates, times, and locations. Going back to older articles it seems like at some point they changed their reporting format to sound more like what we have currently they didn’t name reporters back in 3300 at least. I’m curious when that began. I’m never going to read all of Galnet at this rate haha. Keep going backwards and going on tangents.

Problem with Google translate is that there was a similar Translategate in 2014 which led to many interesting issues which made it seem as if there was a conspiracy. Still interesting though.

TLDR example from the article: "After all, Google Translate interprets “w hy ar e th e tran stla tions so wei rd” in Somali, for instance, as “It is a great way to make it so much better.” "
