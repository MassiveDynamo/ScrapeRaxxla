I like a solid testable hypothesis. Scientific method is a proven way to get results.

On the other hand i also enjoy the wild speculation, as i feel like that can spark ideas and offer different perspectives that can potentially lead to a hypothesis.

Sorry to hear about your dog mate, hope its alright.

Thanks mate. He recovered pretty quickly, especially after his breakfast - typical labrador! But itâ€™s a bit worrying, no previous symptoms & straight out of the blue (black at 05:00!). And I had just got back to sleep properly after another night of insomnia waking at 02:30
