as far as I am aware those were the only 2 systems that FD ever put hand placed items in when the game was first brought into existence.
On this, I'd like you to elaborate.
What about "the Old Systems"? Regular starter system and the few around it (Alpha/Beta transferrals)? Achenar? Alioth? All the rest of Federal/Imperial/Alliance/Independent systems more or less transferred from FE2/FFE? And all the catalogue stars?
What point in testing/releasse timetable you reckon "the game was first brought into existence"?
