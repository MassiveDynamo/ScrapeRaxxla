Im pretty sure that someone ran 'raxxla' through with hexedit as the key and came up with Kwatis or something on those lines, since in hindsight im not sure how the 2 xs wouldnt become the same letter. Decryption isnt my strong suit. Wild speculation is my strong suit lol

Well, I preferred it when people posted hypotheses which were investigated. I still do that, but have rather run out of ideas since my Alpha Centauri/Paradise Lost hypothesis seems to lead nowhere. I never believed much of the mythology discussions.

My dog had a fit 90 minutes ago, Iâ€™m tired and rather grumpy!
