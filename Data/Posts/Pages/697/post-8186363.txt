Well, I preferred it when people posted hypotheses which were investigated. I still do that, but have rather run out of ideas since my Alpha Centauri/Paradise Lost hypothesis seems to lead nowhere. I never believed much of the mythology discussions.

My dog had a fit 90 minutes ago, Iâ€™m tired and rather grumpy!
I like a solid testable hypothesis. Scientific method is a proven way to get results.

On the other hand i also enjoy the wild speculation, as i feel like that can spark ideas and offer different perspectives that can potentially lead to a hypothesis.

Sorry to hear about your dog mate, hope its alright.
