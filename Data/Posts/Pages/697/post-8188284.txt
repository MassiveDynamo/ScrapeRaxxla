Slightly off topic...but as this the Raxxla thread anything could actually be on topic, even by mistake...

Heading over to the Conflux sites, probably there tomorrow or next day latest. Anyone on XB want to wing up and check them out? First time for me there but all welcome.

I visited them in DW2 earlier this year. At the time one site was being overflown by 3 aggressive NPC. Seem to remember I landed some distance away and visited by buggy.
