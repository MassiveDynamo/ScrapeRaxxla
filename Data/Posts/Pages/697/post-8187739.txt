CMDR Marcos Black (or something along those lines) created the thread, and as I have said on numerous occasions, people spend more time on the thread than they do searching for Raxxla. This thread was meant to be a progress log, but now it's a tinfoil-fest.

Edit: nobody has any idea what we are dealing with. Raxxla is currently nothing more than a name and a rumor.

I sure do love reading this ship's log, not because I started it, but because of all the great and imaginative contributions through the last 4Â½ years. In my mind any tinfoil post could turn out to be the spark that ignites the fire that is Raxxla (and so the end of this ship's log).

The quest has personally led me to many adventures, unexpected journies and subject matters I knew nothing of. I would love to be able to follow up on every theory, but even with my cockpit time, this is sadly not possible.
