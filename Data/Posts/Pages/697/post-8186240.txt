I honestly don’t like my last one. Too weird for me haha. I’ll keep an eye out for more like it though.

I want concrete stuff, dates, times, and locations. Going back to older articles it seems like at some point they changed their reporting format to sound more like what we have currently they didn’t name reporters back in 3300 at least. I’m curious when that began. I’m never going to read all of Galnet at this rate haha. Keep going backwards and going on tangents.
