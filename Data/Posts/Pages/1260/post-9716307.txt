There is a realistic possibility that it is in game and can be found (that relates to 50% probability).

However I still wouldn’t be at all surprised if it wasn’t. FD has an MO of inserting content over time; to date all content insertion has been temporal and community focused. If it were such a big deal as FD make it out, it’s probable they don’t want some random Cmdr finding it by accident; unless it’s not actually that big a deal and just an Easter egg.

Based on that one assumption one could presume it isn’t in game ‘yet’. We also have to remind ourselves this thread sits within the 'lore / Role Play' section...

FD statements are generally noncommittal; to say it’s in game, in the galaxy, or simply out there is not enough because it also has to be ‘accessible’. It can technically be in the game if it’s locked behind a narrative wall. The Mars relic is in game, it’s lore but according to MB, it’s a narrative element, so although we can’t locate it, nor interact with it, technically its in game.

It’s a question of semantics, and relative to what we as participants want out of the exercise.

I would like to presume it is in game because the evidence isn’t conclusive either way; but it does presently provide me a reason to explore and visit various locations, I remain a healthy sceptic, and an optimistic pessimist.
