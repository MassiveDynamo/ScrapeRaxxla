EDSM Duplicate Names (570 Systems) there also triple and a quadName

StellarForge would call them:
"Synuefe QZ-O e6-23" <-> (64#: 100103349436) and
"Prua Dryoae UO-A f5" <-> (64#: 2852647525) = "Prua Dryoae UO-A f0-5"

my guess (can't start game atm) the Synuefe is the one whit the bilionares description.

SystemNames do not need to be uniqe (but still most are) only the 64bit# must be uniqe
there is also this List whit Systems having same Coordinates.

Sadly nothing to worry to much about.
