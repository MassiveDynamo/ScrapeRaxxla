To me it seems like the toast includes artists descriptions of degenerate stars and their jet cones. Perhaps the mechanic of FSD supercharging remaining persistent until a jump is made points to possible prerequisites for some sort of activation. Consider one of the recent events where scanning a beacon provided a permit lock, a mechanic not previously discussed. Perhaps a supercharged ship is the key to unlock new information/trigger when docked at the correct station or when scanning the correct POI.
I could agree with you for the beacon scan that gave us the permit for HIP 22460 (where the megaship overlook was) IF it wasn't bugged for months (almost 3 years).

IF it wasn't bugged, we could have follow the lead to HIP 22460 and learn about "The Witch" and Azimuth. But the game narrative were asleep at that time and the logs' storiy depended a lot on it.
Fdevs just invented a story to justify the bug/lack of will to fix the Colonia Crash Ship T9 (commander Hyford in game lore).
