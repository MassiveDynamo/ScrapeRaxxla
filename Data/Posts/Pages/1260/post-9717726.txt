To me it seems like the toast includes artists descriptions of degenerate stars and their jet cones. Perhaps the mechanic of FSD supercharging remaining persistent until a jump is made points to possible prerequisites for some sort of activation. Consider one of the recent events where scanning a beacon provided a permit lock, a mechanic not previously discussed. Perhaps a supercharged ship is the key to unlock new information/trigger when docked at the correct station or when scanning the correct POI.
