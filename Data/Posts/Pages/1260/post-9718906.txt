I Carinae?
I don't have the same system
Only the faction "Secret Billionaires"

In system Information i don't have the same as you.

Edit: I tried with Horizons and it seems that there are 2 systems named "I Carinae": the one in attached files and the one CMDR Davanix posted.
It seems that Odyssey gives you only the first occurence of the system name that we search.
