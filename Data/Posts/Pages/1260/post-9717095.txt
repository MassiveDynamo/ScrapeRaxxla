I think it's pretty safe to assume Raxxla isn't in the game at this point.
Well according to FD’s latest message (and they should know):

“Explored star systems: 222,083,678
(Approximately 0.0555% of the estimated 400 billion in the galaxy explored so far).”

So I think it’s pretty safe to say your definition of “pretty safe” isnt the same as mine!

And since you don’t know WHAT it is, how do you know you haven’t already found it?
