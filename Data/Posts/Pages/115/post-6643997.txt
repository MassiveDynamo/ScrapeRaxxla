On the subject of interesting names, have you ever heard of Naomi Jameson?

She was a miner that crashed on the innermost planet in the Zearla system. The planet was named Jameson's Wreck, in the previous games, but is now simply Zearla 1.

/fun fact.

Nice find. Is that info from the Gazetteer or in-game references?
