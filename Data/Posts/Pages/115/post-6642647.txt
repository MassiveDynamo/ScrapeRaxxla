Sorry to go off-topic, but since there's a few ex-Rifters floating around here, I wanted to mention that DrewW has decided to publish a blog about the Salome event and his reflections on it a year on.

It'll go up on the precise anniversary of her death - 29 April

Info is on his Facebook page.

Meanwhile, I STILL haven't found Raxxla

Don't go off topic! They'll close this thread too!

(Translation: thanks for the info)
