The Mycoid vaccine was developed or at least produced on Hotice 1. Hotice does not exist under that name in ED. The vaccine was made by Inter-Gal/Sirius Medical Research, presumably for INRA. I don't know if the vaccine is still lore at all.

It's a bit difficult to track the position of systems from the FFE map, because the galactic coordinates were reversed in the old map. I made an explanation in this post: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showt...-Discoveries?p=6086544&viewfull=1#post6086544

The region between Sol and Alioth is not unlikely, I think.

Hi, thanks for clarifying ! But somehow I have in mind that Alioth had something to do with the first Thargoid war, I am quite sure having read something about a hidden base in Alioth system...... maybe someone be so kind and enlighten me ?

Yesterday I "extended" the trail ( if it continues that heading it defintively could at least strife Alioth) beyond Alioth and the bubble and tried to find a stellar formation or nebula or cloud where the trail could lead to, but I found nothing like that at all with such characteristics.
