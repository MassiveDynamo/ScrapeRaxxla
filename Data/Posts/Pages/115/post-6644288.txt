And Jameson's Pride in, I think, Leesti?

EDIT: I bet if we map out all the planets named after or connected to the Jamesons it'll draw a big arrow pointing right at Raxxla

That one is in the Uszaa system. None of the planets in Uszaa were named in Fe2/FFE.
Probably means that a Jameson managed to crash there in the last 50 years.
