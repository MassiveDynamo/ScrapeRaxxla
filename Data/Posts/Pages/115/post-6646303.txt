Ok I know it's probably space madness, but it isn't the Traikaae Nebula the attacked station line points to, it looks more like CD-23 13397 (which is also searchable in galmap by cycling through 'TRAIKAAE AA-A H', and appears to be TRAIKAAE AA-A H0') a planetary nebula around a wolf-rayet star. H1 is a planetary nebula around a neut.
