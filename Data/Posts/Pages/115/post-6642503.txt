Sorry to go off-topic, but since there's a few ex-Rifters floating around here, I wanted to mention that DrewW has decided to publish a blog avout the Salome event and his reflections on it a year on.

It'll go up on the precise anniversary of her death - 29 April

Meanwhile, I STILL haven't found Raxxla
Cheers! That should make for interesting reading.
