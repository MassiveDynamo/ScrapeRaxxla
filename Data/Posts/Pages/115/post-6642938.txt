Is it offtopic? Salome said she found Raxxla "..first mentioned in the year 2814." This is from Salome's message during Distant Worlds expodition. Salome isn't exactly Drew Wagar. The date seems to point to weird things happening in Pleiades Sector, and first contact with Thargoids.

I think they are still hiding something behind this word, "contingency", you see mentioned sometimes, like a hidden meaning or something like that.

Weirdest planets in my opinion are Mars and Merope 5 C, but I don't think its either.
