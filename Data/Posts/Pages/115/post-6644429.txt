Do we think the recent galnet article detailing the assassination of the imperial senator has any bearing on this? I'm thinking no, but just curious what the hive thought.

It takes a resourceful group to off a senator on Capitol. It's hard to pin this one on anyone we know though. Could be a false flag operation, to make thargoid friendly activists look bad?

I don't know of any solid connection between the Jameson family and The Dark Wheel.

I think the reintroduction of Halsey may be the first sign of thargoid friendly activism.

Palin has spoken out against the 'dark forces'. This presumably includes INRA, Black Flight and the Club. His possible association with Lori Jamseson(Wings trailer), may be a clue?

I can't see any connection to Raxxla though.
