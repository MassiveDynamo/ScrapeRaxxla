I guess the two that we know of. John Jameson & Naomi. Though I've personally launched from Lave Station and flown directly into the planet while playing as CMDR Jameson and I'm sure I'm not the only one

There was also a planet called Jameson's Rock, in the Zemien system(in FFE). I have no idea if a Jameson ever crashed into it.
