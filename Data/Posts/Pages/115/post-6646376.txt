Considering the Raxxla outside-the-bubble theory, I got a wild hair to check out the Thargoid progression pattern of disabled stations. The general line doesn't line up from origin to Sol, it points up and beyond the Bubble and there's this nebula about 4klys coreward (Ara-something?) I'm checking out as it seems to line up with their general heading.

Hey, I have the strong feeling that the "trail" of systems attacked by Thargoids is leading more or less towards Alioth - where the cure for the mycoid was developed (as far as I know lore) - maybe the Claxians (are these the ones being persecuted by the Klaxians or was it vice versa ?) hope to get support by the Alliance again ?
