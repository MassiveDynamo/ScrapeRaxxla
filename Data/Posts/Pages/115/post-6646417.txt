Hey, I have the strong feeling that the "trail" of systems attacked by Thargoids is leading more or less towards Alioth - where the cure for the mycoid was developed (as far as I know lore) - maybe the Claxians (are these the ones being persecuted by the Klaxians or was it vice versa ?) hope to get support by the Alliance again ?

The Mycoid vaccine was developed or at least produced on Hotice 1. Hotice does not exist under that name in ED. The vaccine was made by Inter-Gal/Sirius Medical Research, presumably for INRA. I don't know if the vaccine is still lore at all.

It's a bit difficult to track the position of systems from the FFE map, because the galactic coordinates were reversed in the old map. I made an explanation in this post: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showt...-Discoveries?p=6086544&viewfull=1#post6086544

The region between Sol and Alioth is not unlikely, I think.
