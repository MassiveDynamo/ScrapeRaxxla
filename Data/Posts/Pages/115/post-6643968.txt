Of course not. This is Raxxla. We have no idea what is or isn't off topic. We could spend days and days discussing engineering with Liz Ryder and not be off topic. Isn't it a bit interesting that one of the engineers has a last name of Ryder? Conspiracy!

On the subject of interesting names, have you ever heard of Naomi Jameson?

She was a miner that crashed on the innermost planet in the Zearla system. The planet was named Jameson's Wreck, in the previous games, but is now simply Zearla 1.

/fun fact.
