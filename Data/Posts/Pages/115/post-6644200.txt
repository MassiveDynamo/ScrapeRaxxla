There was also a planet called Jameson's Rock, in the Zemien system(in FFE). I have no idea if a Jameson ever crashed into it.

And Jameson's Pride in, I think, Leesti?

EDIT: I bet if we map out all the planets named after or connected to the Jamesons it'll draw a big arrow pointing right at Raxxla
