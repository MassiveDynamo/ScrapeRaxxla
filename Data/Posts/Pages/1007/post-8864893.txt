MB only said that Raxxla was in game, and not whether it was accessible at the time. Maybe they were waiting for Odyssey mechanics to turn it on? (as a Zurara-style "it was always here" reveal). It does seem to be hard to find a station when you have a broken canopy and working sensors that do pick it up, so a "dark" station sounds way worse.

It seems as though the "station salvage" mechanics in Odyssey might be how TDW station is even used, if the station is still lost. But it is not hard to imagine that even an abandoned (or staffed, but without interstellar communications, etc) "dark" station could use a small amount of fuel occasionally to maintain orbit. Maybe some more detailed mentions of TDW station (clues) are in another station or planetary base requiring Space Legs. Maybe in addition to being cut-off from interstellar contact, they are waiting for help rebuilding once they are found again.
Raxxla could well be uaccessable. I have this memory of MB or DB saying: ‘we know how to get there’, but I can’t find that interview.
Knowing how to get there could mean knowing you have to wait ten years, so it really doesn’t matter.

No one from FD has claimed that the DW station has been in the game from the start. It probably wasn’t and may still not be.
