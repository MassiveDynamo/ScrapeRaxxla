The one with a hat or the one with an axe?
The one with the hat. He recently started a new commander. Imitation as the sincerest form of flattery and all that. Or is it mockery? Never could remember that one. Updated just now but haven't got up the nerve (motivation) to start it up and hit the kill switch yet (or to reset up my joystick and throttle and keybinds, sigh.) Although the strange draw of parallax might pull me back in more than the new exploration changes (eventually, maybe). Parallax and lockdown.
