Oh yes, I agree! It’s good to talk! Discussions in this thread have been the most fun since... well, I forget ‘cos I’m getting old, but I’m sure I used to have other sources of fun, something to do with young ladies in Lave....

(Edit: you want FD consistency too?? Watch out-here comes another aerial porcus porcus! )

Yes, many things that were discussed around the time of the original design discussion forum and related interviews/posts/ streams seem to have been forgotten/changed. This is to be expected in development of a complex game, I just wish FD would be more upfront about what has changed, why, when, if there is any possibility of a feature coming back at some stage, and especially about lore changes since this is the history our characters have grown up with and defines the context of in-game life. Of course documented history doesn’t necessarily (often?) reflect the true historical events & I think FD are deliberately trying to bring that “fog of history” into the feel of the game, but!

However the “secret society” idea from the video is reiterated in the Codex when it talks about the recruitment practice of the Dark Wheel. They needn’t have done that if the secret society idea had been dropped, so I think this was corroboration of the fact. I also think that as a couple of devs appear to have said either the Elite missions are still in-game, or they cannot comment, that this is a storyline which is deliberately obfuscated to keep us guessing but it’s there to find. It’s working, this is post 20,180!!!
