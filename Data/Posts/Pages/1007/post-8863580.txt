I'm still interested to see how they'll deal with players just squashing commanders with space ships (which i will 100% do whenever possible). you can't exactly explain away being ground into the dirt with magic escape pods anymore. And i presume your walking around body is an actual body and not a cyborg avatar-style clone we just happen to have on our ships.

All ground exploration suits will be fitting with titanium reinforcement connecting from helmet along the spine and legs to the boots, and come with a high-powered plasma tin opener to cut a hole in the hull of any ship attempting it, instantly depressurising the craft and perma-killing the pilot
