Yes again true.Then again FD also imply that every element of game play style is seemingly justified. E.g. being a pirate, breaking the law doesn't stop you becoming Elite, in fact in some instances it expedites it.

Nor does the Pilots Federation kick you out for just killing everyone.

Factions have short memories, assassinate a few diplomats, then hand over a few credits and alls forgiven. Your rep goes up / down / then up again.

Nowhere does FD stipulate that crime stops your progression. I think this was inferred at the start, but only inferred, much like a gentlemans agreement, so yes maybe crime does impact some progress bar - but surely, that ought to have been stipulated someplace (and dont call me sherley) I honestly feel the game was launched incomplete, and has been put together over time like Theseus’s ship.

Ok Shirley!
(You don’t moonlight as a wrestler do you?)

But TDW are described explicitly in the Codex as a band of adventurers etc, so I’ve long argued that they wouldn’t be interested in the normal faction mission stuff. I can’t see the real DW offering assassination missions etc. This is partly what makes me think TRDW might be a PF group-not a normal faction. TDW in SD may be the outer rim of TRDW (as described in Reclamation); we need to contact the inner wheels. But I’ve no idea how we do it!
