You’re probably right sir. I have gone lore crazy probably hundreds of times in this thread by now.

I enjoy a little creative madness from time to time but if I test my wild ideas and come back empty handed I’ll own up to it.

I need to start creating an ED RPG campaign by now with how much tinfoil I created or subscribed to here. It’s very hard to get a Cobra Mk III to fit in a normal DND setting haha.

You’re not the only one!
Wild ideas, testing them and discussion is what this thread is all about. It’s not as if we have anything concrete to go on!!
And I hear tinfoil can be recycled into Anacondas, if you find the right station!
