You’re probably right sir. I have gone lore crazy probably hundreds of times in this thread by now.

I enjoy a little creative madness from time to time but if I test my wild ideas and come back empty handed I’ll own up to it.

I need to start creating an ED RPG campaign by now with how much tinfoil I created or subscribed to here. It’s very hard to get a Cobra Mk III to fit in a normal DND setting haha.
