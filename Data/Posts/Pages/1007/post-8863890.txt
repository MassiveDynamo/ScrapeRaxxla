(You don’t moonlight as a wrestler do you?)

But TDW are described explicitly in the Codex as a band of adventurers etc, so I’ve long argued that they wouldn’t be interested in the normal faction mission stuff. I can’t see the real DW offering assassination missions etc. This is partly what makes me think TRDW might be a PF group-not a normal faction. TDW in SD may be the outer rim of TRDW (as described in Reclamation); we need to contact the inner wheels. But I’ve no idea how we do it!
Thats the spirit.
Good sound reasoning
