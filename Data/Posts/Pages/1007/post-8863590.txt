I like this idea a lot. Not sure as to how it should be approached or what we’d look for there but great thinking nonetheless. This would also seemingly tie into the right side of MBs back tattoo, the portion that appears to be the pearly gates being a hint to Golden Gate. I still find it very curious that an image of Adamastor was discovered on the left side of tattoo and we just so happened to receive an in game ship named Adamastor mentioned in the super cruise news skit that mentioned a Raxxla discovery around the corner. That’s a mouthful.

I’ll admit I was discouraged when I found out New California was renamed to Argents Claim but this idea could still explain the magazines on the desks of the presenters. The magazines were two regarding Alioth and one about Winking Cat, which also took place first in Alioth.

Thinking out loud again.

Well, strictly speaking it’s not Adamastor on MB’s back. That figure is taken from the Triton Gate at the Pena Palace in Portugal. However the gate may well have been inspired by Adamastor character in a story by an earlier medieval Portuguese novelist. Of course FD could have decided to merge Adamastor into the lore mix quite independently, or then again perhaps it is all related .......

P.S. careful, Lore Madness is much worse than Space Madness!
