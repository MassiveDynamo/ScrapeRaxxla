Still looking huh? Just my annual check-in. Happy holidays all. Maybe in 2021 someone will be able to walk to Raxxla... Toying with the idea of killing my commander and starting over from scratch again for something to do, but not sure if I have the motivation, haven't tuned in for a while now.

Does the PF have a Samaritans section dedicated to dealing with pilots who are suicidal? Space madness is common... staring into all that Void! Quick, give them a call!
