Triton wasn't always locked though, but has been for some time (At least as far back as Dec. 2015)

Although previously it was open AND land-able!

Evidence here, here, and here.

From what I postulated previously, I believe it's close to the bubble, but not necessarily at the heart of the bubble... Is there a reason we are assuming it's in the heart of the bubble? and that it has to be land-able moon? Not to question Jorki as he is almost always spot-on, just curious if I missed something...

I've always been suspicious of Polaris. As far as i know it's been permit locked since launch with no explanation, is relatively close to the bubble, and has links to previous lore.

Hi Cmdr!
ALWAYS question! That's what science is about! And I freely admit I've been wrong lots of times!

I was just speculating on the possibility of Raxxla being within the bubble for short travel times with old-style drives and extrapolating that onto the centre of the bubble. There is no other reason. But there are frequent npc visits to Triton so something is going on there.

I suspect Polaris is locked because of previous (in lore) Thargoid connection; however I'm still at a loss to understand the lore retcon in ED and if Thargoids are coming from the Col70 direction then don't think it now makes sense for Polaris to have any such connection. I've just watched a YT vid that suggested Triton might be locked while FD experiment with atmospheric landings, which may be a possibility, but I would have thought they would be testing that sort of thing in one of the other locked sectors.
