We feel like it would be funny to take a picture of it and upload it to imgur and see how long till the forums and discords explode when someone stumbles across it.

You could set up a Thargoid base and claim it for your queen, then use the time portal to go back and destroy the Klaxians in their original nest (assuming you're an Oresrian!)

Depends how much it lived up to expectations.

If I found it and it was disappointing then I'd keep my gob shut and not tell anyone.

If I found it and it was reasonably decent then I'd invite a select group of people, who could be trusted with the knowledge and power, to join me there.

Could you get dark chocolate Hobnobs and Lavian brandy delivered?
