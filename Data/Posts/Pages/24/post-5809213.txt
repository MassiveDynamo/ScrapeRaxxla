It's Gerard Huke. Looking at the in-game credits and the digital art book he has been co-exec producer alongside Michael for a while, just keeping clear of the forums. See: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showt...hael-Brookes?p=5670850&viewfull=1#post5670850

Ah, not heard the name. I can understand a desire to keep clear of the forums after the vitriol that has been flung around at times by some trolls, but it was nice when Michael Brookes used to occasionally pop into the Canonn thread, gave a bit of human customer relations, even if his posts were awesomely ambiguous- I teasingly rechristened him Machiavelli..
