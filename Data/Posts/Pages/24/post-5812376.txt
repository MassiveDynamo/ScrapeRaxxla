Illogical, does not compute!
Triton is in Sol, the heart of Fed space, and is frequently visited by fed ships; the thargoids have been attacking fed ships and convoys. This only works if the recent Thargoid attacks were not by Oresrians but by Klaxians and why then only against federation? And a spaceport would require Thargoid ships to visit for resupply which would certainly have been noticed in Sol and would have hit galnet in BOLD CAPS!

however, if Triton were a military base with captured technology and Oresrians from the first war then that might make sense! It might also explain how the Club know so much about goid intentions. Did Patreus get his Admiral's rings by pulling the legs off insects??

But I still want to know about the Mars alien artefact; I'm convinced that is highly pertinent.

We were referencing Polaris! And since that other guy is not here WE LAY CLAIM TO THE BOLD CAPS HERE!
