Since MB said yes Raxxla is in the game, you will get no hints about it, it could very well be Permit Locked. It is in the game like he said, but he never said whether or not it was accessible. We think the more likely scenario for that permit locked moon is a Thargoid Base.



But it could also be locked because it has an atmosphere:

Not because it has an atmosphere, from the galmap it is landable but needs a permit. I have occasionally wondered if Triton might be locked due to an alien presence, especially since the Alien Artefact was found on Mars, but I suspect it might be more Guardian than Thargoid (though you should know! ), but it would also be a good hiding place for RaXXla.
