What would you do if you found Raxxla?

Depends how much it lived up to expectations.

If I found it and it was disappointing then I'd keep my gob shut and not tell anyone.

If I found it and it was reasonably decent then I'd invite a select group of people, who could be trusted with the knowledge and power, to join me there.
