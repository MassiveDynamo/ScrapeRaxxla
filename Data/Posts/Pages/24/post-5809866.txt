Not because it has an atmosphere, from the galmap it is landable but needs a permit. I have occasionally wondered if Triton might be locked due to an alien presence, especially since the Alien Artefact was found on Mars, but I suspect it might be more Guardian than Thargoid (though you should know! ), but it would also be a good hiding place for RaXXla.

I might be remembering it wrong, but wasn't the permit only put in place relatively recently?
