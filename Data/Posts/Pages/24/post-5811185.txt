just my off the wall thought process, but has anyone considered Raxxla might be Triton? It is permit-locked, it is visited by Fed military ships (I've watched them), it is a land-able moon of Neptune (i.e. ties in with Neptune Ryder), is at the heart of the bubble, "Triton" & "Raxxla" have the same number of letters- I'm no good with codes but it may be an encryption of the name...

Since MB said yes Raxxla is in the game, you will get no hints about it, it could very well be Permit Locked. It is in the game like he said, but he never said whether or not it was accessible. We think the more likely scenario for that permit locked moon is a Thargoid Base. But it could also be locked because it has an atmosphere:

I might be remembering it wrong, but wasn't the permit only put in place relatively recently?

Triton wasn't always locked though, but has been for some time (At least as far back as Dec. 2015)

Although previously it was open AND land-able!

Evidence here, here, and here.

From what I postulated previously, I believe it's close to the bubble, but not necessarily at the heart of the bubble... Is there a reason we are assuming it's in the heart of the bubble? and that it has to be land-able moon? Not to question Jorki as he is almost always spot-on, just curious if I missed something...

I've always been suspicious of Polaris. As far as i know it's been permit locked since launch with no explanation, is relatively close to the bubble, and has links to previous lore.
