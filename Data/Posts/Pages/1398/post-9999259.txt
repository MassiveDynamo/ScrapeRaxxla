Die was cast long ago, it’s inevitable by now, those without sight followed their greed. FD (club) provided the kindling but not the matches. They always said it was a social experiment….

Some of the nicest people I’ve met are Thargoids. They certainly don’t see us like we see them. Unless you covet certain toys, things might get interesting at last.

I wouldn’t worry. It’s a big enough galaxy, plenty of room for everyone.

Indeed so many toys to be coveted, The Dark Wheel hiding in its Lagrange 3 Point of the 8th moon of a gas giant, the Song that Sings across the galaxy that is the SagA* signal but is so much more, many secrets that only science and persistence will bring results to... We have no confirmation Fdev is 'TheClub' plot-wise though it would explain the lack of information for the players in many regards.
