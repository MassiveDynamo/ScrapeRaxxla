Very curious. Ophiuchus rings another bell. Ophiuchus also known as the 13th sign of the zodiac. Ophiuchus is also home to a certain nova SN 1604, Kepler's Supernova, Kepler's Nova or Kepler's Star.

Allegorical illustration from 1618 showing the Rosicrucian's Invisible College in its role as a bastion of free thinking in the arts and sciences. The new stars in Serpens in 1604 (upper left) and Cygnus in 1600 (upper right) are pictured as being major influences on the movement at this time.


Johannes Kepler's book of 1606 on the stellar nova seen in Serpens in the year 1604 and in Cygnus in 1600. Right, a page from the same book with a woodcut showing the new star in Cygnus located at the base of the swan's neck. Next to it appears the letter "N."

St Michael and Lucifer as Ophiuchus… I know a certain someone who likes his archangel references!
