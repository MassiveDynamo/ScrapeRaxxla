A slight, tangent but I thought this may be of interest. Little bit of an exclusive.

As I have mentioned before, Robert Holdstock is something of an anomaly in SF and Fantasy scholarly circles as he is lauded for his fantasy work, but his science fiction and his contribution to Elite (by writing The Dark Wheel) is largely forgotten.

I am going to redress this. I have been commissioned to write the new edition of the Historical Dictionary of Fantasy Literature for Rowman and Littlefield. The previous edition was written by Professor Brian Stableford in 2004. This is a massive compilation of fantasy writers and fantasy concepts and is used by academics all over the world.

Included below is the current draft for Robert Holdstock's entry:

HOLDSTOCK, ROBERT (1948– 2009). British writer whose early work was mostly science fiction and horror; some commodified sword and sorcery was bylined “Richard Kirk” and “Chris Carlsen.” His novella, The Dark Wheel (1984), published with the computer game, Elite (1984) is still regarded as a seminal work of mythology amongst fans.

Holdstock’s series comprising Mythago Wood (1984), Lavondyss (1988), the title piece of The Bone Forest (1991), The Hollowing (1993), the stories in Merlin’s Wood (1994), Gate of Ivory, Gate of Horn (1997, aka Gate of Ivory) and finally Avilion (2009) are about a magical wood where archetypes of the collective unconscious of British and Breton folklore—including Arthur, Robin Hood, the Green Man, and the Wild Hunt—are systematically manifest. The Fetch (1991, aka Unknown Regions), “The Ragthorn” (1991 with Garry Kilworth), and Ancient Echoes (1996) are further dark fantasies based in a similar metaphysical system. The Merlin Codex series begun with Celtika (2001) and The Iron Grail (2002) is a hybrid of Celtic and classical forms.

I can't include much more, as this is one entry amongst more than 800 fantasy writers. But, The Dark Wheel deserves to be in there.
