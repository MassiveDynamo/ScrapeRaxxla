A slight, tangent but I thought this may be of interest. Little bit of an exclusive.

As I have mentioned before, Robert Holdstock is something of an anomaly in SF and Fantasy scholarly circles as he is lauded for his fantasy work, but his science fiction and his contribution to Elite (by writing The Dark Wheel) is largely forgotten.

I am going to redress this. I have been commissioned to write the new edition of the Historical Dictionary of Fantasy Literature for Rowman and Littlefield. The previous edition was written by Professor Brian Stableford in 2004. This is a massive compilation of fantasy writers and fantasy concepts and is used by academics all over the world.

Included below is the current draft for Robert Holdstock's entry:

British writer whose early work was mostly science fiction and ; some commodified was bylined “Richard Kirk” and “Chris Carlsen.” His novella, (1984), published with the computer game, (1984) is still regarded as a seminal work of mythology amongst fans.

Holdstock’s series comprising (1984), (1988), the title piece of (1991), (1993), the stories in (1994), (1997, aka ) and finally (2009) are about a magical wood where archetypes of the collective unconscious of British and Breton folklore—including , Robin Hood, the Green Man, and the Wild Hunt—are systematically manifest. (1991, aka ), “The Ragthorn” (1991 with Garry Kilworth), and (1996) are further based in a similar system. The Merlin Codex series begun with (2001) and (2002) is a of and forms.

I can't include much more, as this is one entry amongst more than 800 fantasy writers. But, deserves to be in there.

He covered the Lore of the Feyfolk during his holidays in Cornwall and Devon im assuming, interesting information and conforms to understandings of the flavour that lore links ingame along with evidence of the hand-in-hand rather than handwaviem when mixing science and fantasy together.
