Dye was cast long ago, it’s inevitable by now, those without sight followed their greed. FD (club) provided the kindling but not the matches. They always said it was a social experiment….

Some of the nicest people I’ve met are Thargoids. They certainly don’t see us like we see them. Unless you covet certain toys, things might get interesting at last.

I wouldn’t worry. It’s a big enough galaxy, plenty of room for everyone.
