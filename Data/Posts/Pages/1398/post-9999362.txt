Yes and also 6 constellations (six shapes in logo) Kepler's star being in the center of said discovery, known about for a long time and still very muich being investigated today, between 10000-20000 light years away (makes it relevent in our galaxy and also far enough to remain hidden) was seen by humanity (known and rumored as different things and timelines) the list goes on
Kepler’s Star was SN 1604, 14,000 ly. Most recent readily visible supernova within the Milky Way. Kepler’s star was brighter at its peak than any other star in night sky. I tried to find it as a potential pulsar & hence gravitational wave source to visit, but I believe it’s not in-game. Also apparently omitted are Parker’s Star, Tycho’s Star & Cassiopeia A.
