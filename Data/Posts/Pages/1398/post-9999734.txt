Kepler’s Star was SN 1604, 14,000 ly. Most recent readily visible supernova within the Milky Way. Kepler’s star was brighter at its peak than any other star in night sky. I tried to find it as a potential pulsar & hence gravitational wave source to visit, but I believe it’s not in-game. Also apparently omitted are Parker’s Star, Tycho’s Star & Cassiopeia A.
SN 1604 (Keplers) was a Type 1a Supernova, It left no core remnant expelling its matter entirely and the remains though visible in real life now would not be visible in 3307, not all Type 1a Supernovas leave remnant cores... This also applies to SN 1572 ( Tycho’s Star)...
3C 58 (Parker's) is despite claims in the media likely not the remnant you are thinking it is as its several thousand years to old, It also didnt make the special imported list as it has very little if any information available for its actual location and numerous papers have been retracted regarding its distance and location.
As for Alpha Cassiopeia thats 100% ingame as its in the bubble, are you getting your names mixed up with something else?
