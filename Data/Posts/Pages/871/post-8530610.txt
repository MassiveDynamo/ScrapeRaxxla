If this is something required to find raxxla i would be seriously upset as console users do not have these abilities on their consoles and may not own a computer

No, decoding sound recordings was related to UA (aka thargoid sensor), back in the good old days, and some stations gave out easter eggs in their sounds. Dont think sound is anything to do with Raxxla.
