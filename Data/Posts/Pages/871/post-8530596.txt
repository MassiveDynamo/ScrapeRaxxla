So we need to get Allied and do missions for Pilot’s Federation (with/out space and/or apostrophe??) to get the LFT 509 permit? tDW are a faction of PF if I remember the tourist beacon messages correctly. Run PF missions from Jameson’s Memorial? Reacue missions? Goid bashing missions?
You are correct. They are a "clique " of PF...so why doesn't doing TDW missions increase you hidden PF status??
