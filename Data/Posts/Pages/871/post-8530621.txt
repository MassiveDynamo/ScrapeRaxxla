The Omphalos rift of ancient myth could supposedly be the fissure in the earth directly underneath the Oracle of Delphi (later suspected to be an underground stream).

One myth describes it as the location of the rotten corpse of Pytho slain by Apollo, the fettered vapours drifting up to intoxicate the Oracle.

If it were so simple (obvious) then how about a system directly below Delphi...but following the axi mundi, if you were to align Delphi with Polaris?

Not in game for some time, twas an old theory never investigated.

It was (and still is there) a fissure with high concentration of Carbon monoxide that intoxicated the Oracle.
Another similar place is IRC in todays Turkey - Hells Gate. Sacrificial animals died when a priest waved his hand.
He stepped on a high stone (clever) and animals were brought in front of a fissure.
CO concentrated at ground-level zone killed them instantly, making priest looks cool.
