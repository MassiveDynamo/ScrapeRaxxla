hmm, well that makes sense. I don't know if those two have always been there or I have just noticed them. I see them e.g. by yawing left about 180 degrees.

Those have been there as long as i can remember, been playing since august of 2017.

So we need to get Allied and do missions for Pilot’s Federation (with/out space and/or apostrophe??) to get the LFT 509 permit? tDW are a faction of PF if I remember the tourist beacon messages correctly. Run PF missions from Jameson’s Memorial? Reacue missions? Goid bashing missions?

Turn in exploration data at jameson gives you pilots fed local branch and thargoid kills gives you pilotsfederation.

Im pretty sure what you're think i terms of tdw being connected to pf is elite federation of pilots
