I reckon we need to expand the dark wheel faction to within a certain distance of LFT509 or to a specific system before a permit mission is released.
FD's response about it not being obtainable now, would be true.

I currently have a little project running to expand TDW. We just took LFT 926 in the name of TDW and are currently on Phase one with intentions to expand TDW to near Sol to see what happens. After this we will be looking to expand TDW close to LFT 509 and then onto Lave. For more information on that project see it's thread here: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/turning-the-wheel.546088/ or to get involved in the discussion you can join the Elite Week Discord where it is all being coordinated at: https://discord.gg/Wtgnsbq

We are quite hopeful that group effort (and we have quite a decent size group) is the missing piece of the puzzle to possibly get beyond the current wall we are facing in this search which I believe to be some permit that needs to be obtained. Keep in mind with these permits Frontier hasn't told us that we CAN'T obtain them they simply haven't told us how to. I believe they have been waiting quite some time for us to figure that bit out.
