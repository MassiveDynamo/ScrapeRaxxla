That was more of a response for Vetinari as to why its probable the hero's journey has always been part of it rather than not, although I do agree that confirmation bias increases as variables/additional myths increase.

Ah interesting, I had always thought that IRH would have known, seeing as this information was in the first page of this thread since 2015? I was genuinely surprised to see this very obvious example not included.

I look towards your progress in this quest with interest.

I certainly knew about it but me being one person rehashing what I remember on a topic am not likely to remember every detail that I have read over the last three years at a moments notice. Let alone my specific theory of the hero’s journey as a map, is a very recent one.

Thanking you for pointing it out again. Also IRH isn’t a group, it’s a place.
