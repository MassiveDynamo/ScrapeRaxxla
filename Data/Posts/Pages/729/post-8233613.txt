A lot of it comes down to, what journey/game is fdev expecting me to have and do they have the same 'input' today as in the first few months or years when a lot of the galaxy was being written seemingly with the players direct experience in mind? Or is that a mis-perception of a newer player hearing all the stories of the old days and hunts and chases across the galaxy? Blaze your own trail, yes, but how much are you wanting me to do certain things, you encourage me to visit thagoid space and sites via Felicity Farseer, Guardian through Ram Tah, Colonia even through the Codex and Engineers. Nothing so far points me to any gameplay history, no signpost to Tionisla or Salome or Halsey for example, or am I missing them? What story journey am I expected to be on compared to a player 3 years ago? Do certain things just happen and not need remembering and others need every new player to be more aware of for some reason, maybe just gameplay not role-play? I don't know but I have become comfortably numb.


see the bigger picture, you are starting to
The reason why nobody else makes mmo's with a fixed longterm narrative, this is. (hint: because it's wasteful and unsustainable and basically a middle finger to any late-comer)

Though, even as someone who has been in since the beginning, the narrative and story like everything in the game is ignorable. It means nothing and doesn't matter unless you choose to make it matter. So even those of us playing that long, few have experienced any of the story. It's just been the same game the entire time, 0 things have changed except how many credits you get for doing something and minor tweaks to how you do it in some cases.
