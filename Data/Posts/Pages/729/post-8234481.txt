I was more impressed with the look-a-like lock some short distance in front of the doors. Does not fit visually with other objects.

You are talking about Ancient Ruins or Guardian Structures? If Guardian Structures, I had checked recently and there are no hidden assets behind the doors currently. You can try again, maybe you can see something different.
