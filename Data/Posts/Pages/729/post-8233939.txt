Thank you for pointing out something I had missed, though I had seen it before. It certainly fits the theory.

I am not sure if you are aware your correction comes off with a twinge of a condescending attitude. People miss things, this is why collaboration was created. This is how we have this forum thread, and several discord servers with people sharing knowledge and assisting in filling in blind spots. Though, generally those corrections are done in the knowledge that a friendly correction will be offered in return some day. You have so much to offer the discussion, but your 'blessings' feel an awful lot like 'curses'.
