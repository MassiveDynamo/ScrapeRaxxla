The hero's journey narrative is said to be a prerequisite of having your script read when trying to sell it to a studio and it's likely to be a factor in writing books, if you want them to be successful. In very basic terms, the twelve trials of Hercules are based on the progress of Sol along the ecliptic plane each day and year.

It's fairly safe to assume mythology is similar because our ancestors were looking at the same local star.

[Edit: We're still only half way through a (delayed?) ten year project. I'd guess Raxxla is on hold for now.]
