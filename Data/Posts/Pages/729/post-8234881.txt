Ra is tricky. Is it an old world, or isn't it?

It's an Elite Galaxy 1 system, but it's also an Egyptian deity. There are probably 50 other in ED.

I think the thing might be that an originally procedurally generated world would catch the attention of developers by having a recognizable name. the mythos just followed.
Anyway, you are right, there isn't a way to know if Ra is the old Ra or not.
