Thank you for pointing out something I had missed, though I had seen it before. It certainly fits the theory.

I am not sure if you are aware your correction comes off with a twinge of a condescending attitude. People miss things, this is why collaboration was created. This is how we have this forum thread, and several discord servers with people sharing knowledge and assisting in filling in blind spots. Though, generally those corrections are done in the knowledge that a friendly correction will be offered in return some day. You have so much to offer the discussion, but your 'blessings' feel an awful lot like 'curses'.

That was more of a response for Vetinari as to why its probable the hero's journey has always been part of it rather than not, although I do agree that confirmation bias increases as variables/additional myths increase.

Ah interesting, I had always thought that IRH would have known, seeing as this information was in the first page of this thread since 2015? I was genuinely surprised to see this very obvious example not included.

I look towards your progress in this quest with interest.
