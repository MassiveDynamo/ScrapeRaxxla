how you get this quest?
How much you want to bet that raxxla was some sort of old adventurers joke like hutton orbital is now...

To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies! To the whisperer in witchspace, the siren of the deepest void! The parent's grief, the lover's woe, and the yearning of our vagabond hearts. To Raxxla!

That or the whisperer in witchspace is a reference to that story that might be guardian related about the people being told to do things that involved that senator. Also that ship being stolen supposedly. Assuming that wasn't a cover story.
