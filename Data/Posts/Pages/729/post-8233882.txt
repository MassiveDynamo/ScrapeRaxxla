Guardian doors: Has someone tried to use the external camera and possible clipping errors to look behind those doors?
(Even if FDev somehow lazy loads the complete content behind the door when the door opens, there might be something to see. First part of a hallway?)
Hm, I don't remember seeing doors at all ... have to travel to some Guardian location next..

Yep, tried it. Did not see anything special. However, that should not stop you from doing it.
