Spotted an error in your précis, he actually said “Raxxla itself, the mystery, who's rumours and sightings seem to ebb and flow on a 50 year cycle and we're approaching that 50-year peak”

So his concept was that Raxxla was a wandering planet (or perhaps a comet?) on a 50 year orbit. I find it interesting that FD didn’t allow this (DW said all writers were told by FD to avoid the topic of Raxxla) but made some alternative suggestions.

Oh, and interesting that there were some indigogo ED book ideas that presumably didn’t get the funding, but didn’t look at those links.
Much appreciated, I will correct my transcript.

Yeah, I think I noticed some 12 writer-package backers, but from what I understand it was 5 that made it? Or perhaps that was from this one publisher only?
