I miss MB you could tell he had a passion for the game... Just read the latest missive about Galnet..... Dont even know who the Executive Producer is these days but I think he should be fired....

Latest missive? Thereâ€™s a Galnet? I thought that had been archived, along with The Club, a plot, and lore
