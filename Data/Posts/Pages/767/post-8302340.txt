theres a bit of a clue in the Codex its under Geographical & Biological not Xeno

Some anomalies have 2 or 3 'traits' that become apparent under different cicumstances (things that you can do in your ship to activate) so do something and scan again just in case until 'All traits found' in Codex entry. Cant remember if 'electricals' have more than 1 trait, think their defences is the only one.
