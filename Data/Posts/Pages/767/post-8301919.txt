We can, but we also have a fair idea for where things are going to take place, and we've had those locked off from the start, as well as some speculative areas as well.

Just an interesting quote from MB. Answers a lot about why some things are permit locked...as well as some speculative.

Means that Lave 2, Diso, Triton etc are going to be important at some point hopefully, Col mostly Thargs isn't it but these are more Raxxla related possibilities?
