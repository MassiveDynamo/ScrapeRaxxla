Jeeps not sure. I don't like the look of that it says to the left of your fuel gauge... "use you to anal" RUN!!!
I don't know if this is an intentional troll post with that picture but if you look over on the left hand side where it says that's what he has targeted and where it says 'use your composition scanner to analyze' and you just put your hand over where it says the KO2 type and look the whole way down from there it says 'use you to anal', KO2type right above it, with the line that's above where it says 'use you to anal'. so I don't know if this is just how it glitches out the Hud or UI or if its just a photo shopped troll post.
