breaks scanner as thargoids do
...tried to feed it by mining asteroid near it - don't eat
this thing can fly itself, also close to ship it can control my engines. If i try to "mine" this thing it turns engines so i go close to it to "hit" and it drains shield.
If you just fly direct to impact, you just pass through.

Maybe it need xeno scanner installed? >:

Scan it with the Composition Scanner, have a look in the Codex for what it is...should be in a Stellar Phenomenon/Lagrange Cloud but a lot of bugs out in the black so not sure what should be where sometimes.
