I'm lost with ur anal humors ... usually russians translate "a.s.s " as "anal" ...jut because in rus same word and they always think about it.
any way, nothing like that there. I'm thinking to return there later with xeno scanner installed.
Info about it is short too:
https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/K-Type_Anomaly

If you check ingame codex for sections around center, there are couple other things like Q anomaly etc. And they look like some kind of energy as well.
1st records are dated somewhen after 3304 and xeno scanner was added in 3303 wiki says.
The wiki you linked shows KO1 then KO3. You might be the first to find a KO2. I wouldnt know for certain though personally. Ive not seen any of those myself
