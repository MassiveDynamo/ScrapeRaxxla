I'm lost with ur anal humors ... usually russians translate "a.s.s " as "anal" ...jut because in rus same word and they always think about it.
any way, nothing like that there. I'm thinking to return there later with xeno scanner installed.
Info about it is short too:

If you check ingame codex for sections around center, there are couple other things like Q anomaly etc. And they look like some kind of energy as well.
1st records are dated somewhen after 3304 and xeno scanner was added in 3303 wiki says.
