breaks scanner as thargoids do
...tried to feed it by mining asteroid near it - don't eat
this thing can fly itself, also close to ship it can control my engines. If i try to "mine" this thing it turns engines so i go close to it to "hit" and it drains shield.
If you just fly direct to impact, you just pass through.

Maybe it need xeno scanner installed? >:

Info about it is short too:
https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/K-Type_Anomaly

If you check ingame codex for sections around center, there are couple other things like Q anomaly etc. And they look like some kind of energy as well.
1st records are dated somewhen after 3304 and xeno scanner was added in 3303 wiki says.

The xeno scanner was the goto piece of kit folllowing first reports of alien interdiction,although i dont know how sales stack up against the shutdown field neutralizer. But the codex was introduced at a later date along with the fss. Being an anomaly, it's difficult to know,but if i were to speculate ,(such is raxxlaaa's way) ,i would say a proto black hole feeding and growing steadily more powerful than you could possibly imagine.Or fairies.
