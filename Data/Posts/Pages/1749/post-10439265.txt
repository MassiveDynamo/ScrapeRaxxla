Sorry if this is off-topic, but maybe it has something to do with it.
The other day I noticed that some unpopulated systems are given names. In particular, I visited (for the first time) the Rex system. Why is this done?
Not off topic at all. FDev clearly made a choice to name these systems but it's never clear why until something shows itself. In the case of Rex, its real designation is - WISE 0458+6434

The Rex character in the Legacy novel might be linked to this system somehow, but on the other hand if it is uninhabited and nothing is there then the lore connection becomes less likely.
Chances are it was a name picked from a candidate list and nothing more...
