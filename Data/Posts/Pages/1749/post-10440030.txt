Ya I like to imagine it indicates a Cave in a valley partway down the Mountain.
This got me thinking about an earlier pondering I had about caves in a mountain.
I was so focused on Zeus' mythological birthplace in Mount Ida that I hadn't explored the alternate - Dikti and the nearby Lasithi Plateau.

In planetary geology a cavus is "an irregular steep-sided depression that does not seem to be an impact crater".
The Cavus family in Legacy may refer to a cave, but it may be just as valid to use the above planetary geology definition.

In mythology, Zeus fathered Minos with Europa. Minos being the king who founded the Labyrinth built by Daedalus. Minos and his brothers Aeacus and Rhadamanthus also became the judges of the dead in Hades.

The idea of Hades / Hell / Dis led me to investigating Mars names - Noctis Labyrinthus, and various Cavus formations - eg. Deuteronilus Cavus, Ismenius Cavus etc.
Also, the alternate name of Dis Pater (Roman god of underworld) is Rex Infernus.
As I was looking around a globe map of Mars near Olympus Mons I started to see familiar shapes and patterns...Of note, the region around Olympus Mons including the smaller mountains Arsia, Pavonis, Ascraeus, and Alba are all within the Daedalia Planum.
This is totally a shot in the dark, but the ideas around geological formations and mountains started to get my imagination spinning
SPOILER: THE PRISON OF DAEDALUS





I have no idea if this would mean Mars is a candidate or there is a further mystery to explore (ie. the Mars Artifact). Maybe something floating in space above Mars? Maybe the idea of a newer civilisation building upon the stories and legends of an earlier civilisation?
Probably nothing, but it was an interesting surprise when things started lining up
