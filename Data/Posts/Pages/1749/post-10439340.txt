There's enough noise in the signal to see a lot of things if you zoom in.
What's almost certain is an escaping bird, with something in its beak (a prize?).
I'm not sure it is a mountain; it looks more like a cave entrance to me.
I agree, I'm pretty sure it's not a mountain. It's a line that's essentially just the most visible part of a larger image. I don't think it's a bird either, but it's certainly bird-like. That's why I originally called it "The bird in the mountain", but I always add that it's not a bird or a mountain! I used to call that small feature to the left the 'Hummingbird' too.

As you can tell there's definitely more in the so-called 'landscape signal' than people have previously investigated.

This is only one small segment of a very long signal, and there's a lot more features like this - more than I've been able to see, definitely.

Whatever it is, it's certainly a hidden mystery that needs solving.
