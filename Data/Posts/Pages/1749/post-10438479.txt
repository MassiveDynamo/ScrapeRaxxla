Definitely the idea of the Labyrinth as a prison / domain for an entity seems appropriate. The notions of "journey we must all take for ourselves" and a "test of skill and courage" as well as a "state of cosmic enlightenment" for reaching it are all befitting the symbolism of a labyrinth. Also the historic design of labyrinth is one that is unicursal with no branching paths (as opposed to a maze) so if Raxxla is such then at least we won't have to contend with dead ends once we find the path........ right?

It would also make sense that the logo represents this in an abstracted manner.

Ya i still think there is a Axis going on here. So ya essentially a Heaven / Middle / Hell. I assume Ascension is associated with Heaven .. or is it Ascendancy? The dark wheel/omphalos rift and maybe even the Wanderer… with the middle and the Labyrinth - Exile associated with Hell.

But ya im spitballing based on what i feel is the structure. The mountain signal in the center makes alot of sense to me as a symbol for ascension. - and as ascension isnt a physical thing … maybe that is all there is for us there now? But a labyrinth is often used as a tool for meditation… so maybe labyrinths all around? Im focusing on the middle and the hell at the moment though.
