Again caves and barrows.

‘An omphalos may be a stone marker, or egg shaped conical object, a protruding hub or raised central area, such as that of a wheel, shield or vessel, but it also stands as a descriptive term for a protruding navel as a raised hill or geographic mound.

The location of Crete can be identified as such, which it’s name of, the city of the navel, and similarly the location in Dante’s Inferno is a mountain.

So, one projection is maybe, given the potential clues in game and Brookes book, we may be looking for a ‘mountain rift’.

RH identifies the lineage of the Celts as originating from Switzerland and talks of the sacred mountain and caves of, Hallstatt as being a proto-gateway’.

I can suspect the use of ‘Julia Cavus’ was a reference towards a cave, in Celtic mythology a passageway to the Otherworld. Again Brookes may have used his reference to ‘Beaumont’ far below Achenar, and the placement of tannhauser gate, as a potential clue ‘for those with eyes to see’ a journey to the underworld, and onto to the mountain!
