Ya i still think there is a Axis going on here. So ya essentially a Heaven / Middle / Hell. I assume Ascension is associated with Heaven .. or is it Ascendancy? The dark wheel/omphalos rift and maybe even the Wanderer… with the middle and the Labyrinth - Exile associated with Hell.

But ya im spitballing based on what i feel is the structure. The mountain signal in the center makes alot of sense to me as a symbol for ascension. - and as ascension isnt a physical thing … maybe that is all there is for us there now? But a labyrinth is often used as a tool for meditation… so maybe labyrinths all around? Im focusing on the middle and the hell at the moment though.
The concept of the mountain is key somehow.

There are those systems with bodies named mountains which encircle the bubble, sloping up to the upper hemisphere and below to the underworld. One side is named after Hindu locations, then a whole bunch on the other from Celtic mountain ranges.

The wider references are tied to mountains too.

Gilgamesh which has systems named after his story, like other myths associated with Otherworlds, had to go the Cedar mountain, and through its forest.

Milton had his Eden on top a mountain topped with cedars on Earth (inside the spheres).

Dante had mount purgatory, with its spiralling path upwards to the top where again Eden resided.

We also have various lost realm worlds whose myths are linked to mountains or caves too, not least Tannhäuser Gate which is slap bang in the middle of this lost realms!

And of course Brookes various references to waiting his turn on the mountain.

And of course the potential Beaumont link via Legacy?!

Not least forgetting that ‘omphalos’ is a word used to describe a mound or mountain.

Mountains, are key, somehow.
