‘An omphalos may be a stone marker, or egg shaped conical object, a protruding hub or raised central area, such as that of a wheel, shield or vessel, but it also stands as a descriptive term for the navel and a raised hill or geographic mound.

The location of Crete can be identified as the , and similarly the location in Dante’s Inferno is a mountain.

So, one projection is maybe, given the potential clues in game and Brookes book, we may be looking for a ‘’.

RH identifies the lineage of the Celts as originating from Switzerland and talks of the sacred mountain and of, Hallstatt as being a proto-gateway.

Note Hallstatt is a village on the shore of ‘Lake Hallstatt’ in Austria's Hoher Dachstein, Holdstock may have been referring to the Hallstatt culture.’

I can suspect the use of ‘Julia Cavus’ was a reference towards a cave, in Celtic mythology a passageway to the Otherworld. Again Brookes may have used his reference to ‘Beaumont’ far below Achenar, and the placement of tannhauser gate, as a potential clue ‘for those with eyes to see’ a journey to the underworld, and onto to the mountain!
