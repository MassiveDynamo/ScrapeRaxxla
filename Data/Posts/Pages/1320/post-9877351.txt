Thanks for the post and clarificiation...and yes, I completely agree with you. He is speaking to the nature of a Q&A session on a live stream and nothing more.

And apologies to @Jorki Rasalas , you've changed your avatar and I didn't recognize you. I'd probably have been less snippy had I noticed it was you, old bean!
