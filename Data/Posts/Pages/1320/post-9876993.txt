Ah, but there was also a suggestion by someone that the originator of this report most likely actually spotted a Children of Raxxla outpost (edit: ah, no it was rOmiLaYu suggesting it might have been a CoR staging post tourist beacon https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-9848975) in his nav panel. Michael Brookes said Raxxla is very difficult to find, so I’m quite sceptical about it appearing in a nav panel by happenstance. I suspect from that MB utterance alone that asteroid belt/planetary ring is a likely location.

Not throwing stones, but while you’re doing a search then be aware that unless you’re thorough then you might actually miss the real thing!
There was also a suggestion in another thread (which I can't seem to find now) that Raxxla could be a rogue planet that moves from system to system... so perhaps it was seen in the area we are searching but has moved on now. I am also kind of skeptical of it appearing in the nav panel just from a basic d-scan honk, that doesn't really make sense when everything else in a system is unexplored at that point. Well I'm still looking anyway... the COL70 sector is intriguing, I have been checking every system one by one (Thanks @Aris Tarkus for helping) to see if they are actually ALL permit locked.
