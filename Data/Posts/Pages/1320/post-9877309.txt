Ah, but there was also a suggestion by someone that the originator of this report most likely actually spotted a Children of Raxxla outpost

Not throwing stones, but while you’re doing a search then be aware that unless you’re thorough then you might actually miss the real thing!
Yes I'd seen that comment which I thought was highly likely hence my expectation of drawing a blank. I held off a few days but eventually decided why not help out as nothing to lose and something to do.

I'm still of the mind that we don't know anything about it
what it is
where it is
whether it is locked away
overlooked (alternate name etc.)
requires specific triggers
only becomes known when in close proximity
a myth or legend with nothing to find
