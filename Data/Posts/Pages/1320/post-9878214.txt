The rogue planet is a much discussed option. The question is how far could a rogue planet have moved?
Even a fast one would move at a fraction of light speed, one would think.
Realistically it may have switched system once, since 3300.
From the time it was first mentioned, it may have moved about the same distance as the generation ships, I think.
Ya my little pet theory if it is a “rouge planet” - it would move like a fleet carrier on a schedule and attach itself like a moon to existing planets within systems.
