There was also a suggestion in another thread (which I can't seem to find now) that Raxxla could be a rogue planet that moves from system to system... so perhaps it was seen in the area we are searching but has moved on now. I am also kind of skeptical of it appearing in the nav panel just from a basic d-scan honk, that doesn't really make sense when everything else in a system is unexplored at that point. Well I'm still looking anyway... the COL70 sector is intriguing, I have been checking every system one by one (Thanks @Aris Tarkus for helping) to see if they are actually ALL permit locked.
So long as you’re enjoying the search, that’s the crucial thing!

Rogue planet has been a popular hypothesis for a long time with no real justification. In his Oolite fan fiction series Drew Wagar had Raxxla as a wandering planet, but he said several times that his stories have nothing to do with the game, & he doesn’t know what it is or where.

I lean against the wandering planet hypothesis because Michael Brookes said (see my quotes thread, url in signature) that “it’s not a random thing” & “anyone can find it and more than once”. Like most (all?) of his utterances there is plenty of scope for alternate interpretations, but I’m not convinced wandering planet fits. IMHO far more likely to be a “comet” (due to range restriction for dropping into the instance) or asteroid (since very few people check these out).

The other alternative is always Neptune’s moon Triton: why is it permit locked? Holdstock’s novella had Raxxla occupied and controlled by “powerful twisted men”.
