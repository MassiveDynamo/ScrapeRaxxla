The rogue planet is a much discussed option. The question is how far could a rogue planet have moved?
Even a fast one would move at a fraction of light speed, one would think.
Realistically it may have switched system once, since 3300.
From the time it was first mentioned, it may have moved about the same distance as the generation ships, I think.
Yes indeed, unless 'they' have somehow enabled an FTL drive for the entire planet I guess it couldn't get too far, maybe a fleet carrier like jump of the ENTIRE planet? how much tritium would that require?! Perhaps the gateway to other universes is also an infinite supply of energy.

Or something like this movie .... (it was an amusing idea anyway)
