There was also a suggestion in another thread (which I can't seem to find now) that Raxxla could be a rogue planet that moves from system to system... so perhaps it was seen in the area we are searching but has moved on now. I am also kind of skeptical of it appearing in the nav panel just from a basic d-scan honk, that doesn't really make sense when everything else in a system is unexplored at that point. Well I'm still looking anyway... the COL70 sector is intriguing, I have been checking every system one by one (Thanks @Aris Tarkus for helping) to see if they are actually ALL permit locked.
The rogue planet is a much discussed option. The question is how far could a rogue planet have moved?
Even a fast one would move at a fraction of light speed, one would think.
Realistically it may have switched system once, since 3300.
From the time it was first mentioned, it may have moved about the same distance as the generation ships, I think.
