Thanks for the post and clarificiation...and yes, I completely agree with you. He is speaking to the nature of a Q&A session on a live stream and nothing more.

And apologies to @Jorki Rasalas , you've changed your avatar and I didn't recognize you. I'd probably have been less snippy had I noticed it was you, old bean!
No problem me old male hen!
But I do disagree! I’ve watched that video many times and see no reason at all to change my mind. He was clearly talking about Raxxla and us not knowing what it is. To be clear he answered a question “does Raxxla exist?” And he showed some signs of amusement/chortling in that response, so I suspect the nature of Raxxla is not obvious. Yes, he was looking at Ed when he said those words, but that was because Ed was continuing to chat about the predictability of questions, but David was just continuing his thought train about the question about Raxxla.

@13:45, Q: “does Raxxla exist”? A: “There’s an interesting one! What a silly question, of course (i.e. of course it exists)....You don’t know what it is though! And he did stress the “what”; The italics are my own interpretation!

My change of avatar was due to a) need for a change and b) in relation to this post

I may change it again soon, but it seems so apt at present!
And I havent logged on for over a month now...I’m getting old, and my hands hurt.

And in one of my old posts I pointed out that someone said it’s important to know what you know (awareness) and know what you don’t know (wisdom).
Its not knowing what you know (amnesia/senility) and not knowing what you don’t know (Questing/obfuscation/ politics) that gets you.
