It did, but quite likely retconned by DB who said we donâ€™t know what it is!
This old chestnut is still out there is it?

You'll have to go back and watch the video for the context but it is clear, from watching the video, that Delta Bravo is not saying that we do not know "what" "Raxxla" is. He is commenting on the process of discovering it or finding out about it...or something. I can't be bothered to rummage around and find it, but he is CLEARLY not saying that we, the players, do not know "what" Raxxla even is.
