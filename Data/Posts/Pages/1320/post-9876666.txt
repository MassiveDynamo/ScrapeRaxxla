Nope!

Since there is no evidence to say what Raxxla is then how can you ignore anything if you are doing a concentrated search. Raxxla may be a planet, moon or star...it may also be a ship, station, comet, NPC, Guardian AI, Thargoid Queen, wormhole or asteroid (or asteroid station, or Guardian arkship disguised as an asteroid). If you are searching thoroughly then you need to check out everything, including all the asteroid belts and planetary rings!
Doesn't the original Robert Holdstock novella say it's a planet?
