I'm hoping to narrow down then possibilities over the next week or so...I'll let you know!
If it doesn't have Technetium somewhere in the system, don't bother. From a science perspective, we are looking for something on the asymptotic giant branch (0.5 - 8 solar masses M, F, G, and occasionally K) or something that came from one of these. If you want something to last forever, you err on the side of long-lived but cooler stars. While this helps, that"s still a lot of candidates.
