I think there is a semblance of truth there and agree on all points, Yeats outside my skill set, I long suspected there will be hidden code in the data, remember Brookes clue about the Thargoid sensors for us to listen to them - sound has always been an integral element for ED.

But the concept of ‘Bell’ being involved with ED I find highly doubtful, considering his personal history with Braben!
Agree wrt Bell. I suspect you're right about a mathematical basis to the glyphs; personally long wondered about a link to Braille symbology, but never sufficiently to investigate it myself.
