Exactly, and it goes back to our earlier discussion about the potential design of Raxxla.
Brookes and Braben's intent for these mysteries would likely involve a technical math/science aspect and I can easily see it being in the realm of hobby science and electronics. Braben was one of the co-founders of the Raspberry Pi Foundation and I would imagine Brookes also had an interest in science and astrophysics alongside his science fiction writing. Solving mysteries is often a great vehicle for learning about new things so what better way to combine a love for mythology, philosophy and STEM than with a big complex decades-spanning sci-fi mystery.

A vast amount of astrophysics relates to EM spectrum analysis, which as you say, includes maths and science, and the way Elite Dangerous tends to represent things like that is via audio/visual representations in the frame of "ship sensors".

Now if only there was a mysterious audio signal to analyse...
