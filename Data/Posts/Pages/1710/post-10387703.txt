Perhaps a turreted Beam/Burst/Pulse combo?

This is my current PVE loadout, as far as I can remember...thought I'd saved it but couldn't find it just now so recreated from memory. Something's off as I'm sure the jump range is better than this 20ly. Did try with a mix of MC & frags but that was just confusing in combat. All frags could be very good. Spent an hour or so yesterday in a high Res and got 17MCr bounties. But also got my hand pains reasserting-getting too old for combat!! And in the heat of the moment forgot to check ammo status & ran out of ammmo while taking down a Deadly Imperial Clipper, still did it though! The two thermal vent beams mean I go so cold I suspect hostiles were having difficulty targeting me. Will be interesting to hear your findings on the near-ammo less build! Went all energy weapons on my vette and never have to dock to rearm, just wondered if a MK2 could also do it, but I suspect the 6A power plant is a bit undersized to be truly successful.

Edit-updated this. Had a few memory failures/typing glitches. This shows just 28ly whereas I get 31ly in-game
