Well, took the plunge yesterday...bought some arx and the Phantom MK2 Stellar. As per previous discussion I'm going to call her Kosmic Muppet! Pity the name fields are so limited. I'd quite like to add a secondary line "to infinity and beyond..to Raxxla!"

Was going to engineer it but got sidetracked onto other things. Might be useful searching those planetary rings, endlessly plagued by over-optimistic pirates.

Anybody got one and set up with Beam Lasers & PA/railguns instead of the stock MC/pulse lasers? Only do PVE and get annoyed having to break off to refill ammo.

With the Paradise Lost theme I'm assuming once I find Raxxla they'll all be smitten by thunderbolts and turned into pillars of salt!
