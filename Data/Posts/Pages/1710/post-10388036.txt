I did watch the vid you posted about mining mapping but also found this one by D2EA which I think is interesting.
The first one seemed to be just about using mining laser to mark promising asteroids (couldn't find the second part, which might have clarified things). D2EA's vid makes the points that asteroids are repeating non-random and regenerate after 2 hours (neither of which I was aware of-always thought they were totally randomly generated!) and that some mining maps have been generated by several groups for anyone to use. The second point is useful for anyone doing mining to find the high-value asteroids. But I think the first point is really quite pertinent to the Quest for Raxxla. It could explain why Raxxla was apparently placed in a planetary ring. It might also suggest what Raxxla could be, though I'm not fully convinced it is just a hugely valuable asteroid (e.g. solid Void Opal)...since someone told us it is a topic in the secret FD Alien Lore Manual, so still think it's likely to be an alien ship/object.

I also took a copy of an odd pic I saw recently, I think from FD. A moon orbiting above a planetary belt? I suspect that is not physically possible, but might also explain possible Raxxla location? People wouldn't tend to search there, so a hidden object might well stay hidden!
