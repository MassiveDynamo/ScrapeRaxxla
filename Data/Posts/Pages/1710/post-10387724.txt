I think there is a semblance of truth there and agree on all points, Yeats outside my skill set, I long suspected there will be hidden code in the data, remember Brookes clue about the Thargoid sensors for us to listen to them - sound has always been an integral element for ED.

But the concept of ‘Bell’ being involved with ED I find highly doubtful, considering his personal history with Braben!
Exactly, and it goes back to our earlier discussion about the potential design of Raxxla.
Brookes and Braben's intent for these mysteries would likely involve a technical math/science aspect and I can easily see it being in the realm of hobby science and electronics. Braben was one of the co-founders of the Raspberry Pi Foundation and I would imagine Brookes also had an interest in science and astrophysics alongside his science fiction writing. Solving mysteries is often a great vehicle for learning about new things so what better way to combine a love for mythology, philosophy and STEM than with a big complex decades-spanning sci-fi mystery.
