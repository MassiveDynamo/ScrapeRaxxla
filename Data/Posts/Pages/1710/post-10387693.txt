It's a mathematical pattern known as the Sierpinski triangle, so it makes sense that he would feature it in a guide for programming math.
Although it's not a direct clue, I have long suspected the Guardian secrets are based around math and programming. For instance the obelisk transmissions are likely encoded radio frequency modem tones transmitting data packets and error correction signals. The sentinels and beacons also appear to transmit some kind of WiFi 802.11 or Bluetooth protocol.

Thargoids were scanning us from the very beginning for a reason.

I think there is a semblance of truth there and agree on all points, Yet this is outside my skill set, I long suspected there will be hidden code in the data, remember Brookes clue about the Thargoid sensors for us to listen to them - sound has always been an integral element for ED.

But the concept of ‘Bell’ being involved with ED I find highly doubtful, considering his personal history with Braben!
