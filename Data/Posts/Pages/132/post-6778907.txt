Oh so I just have to look at the Label? I hope that one is not Label-sized because it's already hard to find buildings on planet surfaces...

It is not only having a label on top of it, it has to smell like Raxxla and it has to bark like Raxxla to be the real Raxxla. Other than that is just a copy.
