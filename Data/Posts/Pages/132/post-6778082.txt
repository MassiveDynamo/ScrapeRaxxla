Welcome to the club, CMDR. We have already found raXXla.

Yay! Several of them! Here are two more:

Ooscs Bra XX-L a7-2 and Ooscs Bra XX-L a7-1, right next to the one you already tagged, Ooscs Bra XX-L a7-0.

I cannot tell anything Special about them. They are all similar: a cold Brown dwarf with several cold and barren icy bodies.

BTW it's getting a bit hard to follow all theories on Raxxla. Is there a specific planet number I should take a closer look at?
