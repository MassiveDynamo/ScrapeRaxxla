I agree totally. Beats me why I accepted to do this vain job, but who am I to understand my brain? But I also think that we cannot afford to not explore those systems. Because you never really know for sure until you see it.

A small suggestion if you don't mind, whenever you feel like doing something 'because we can't let it pass just in case' you might want to add this as a subgoal of any other task you had in mind or you may get burned out pretty quickly (I'm looking to all the barnacle hunters out there).
