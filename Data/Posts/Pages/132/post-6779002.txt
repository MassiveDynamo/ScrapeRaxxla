If there are that many raxxla systems maybe if they are found and looked at the same time on the map they will do something interesting. Either help locate another location. Or maybe it will make a connect the dot puzzle with a picture to make a clue! ><

They are literally numbered so you could literally play connect the dots. And as we have found at least 4 different names attacked to the beginning like oosc. Maybe there are four or more puzzles to connect and make a picture that you must figure out. See this game is full of extras! 8D Sort of reminds me of the white line graphics of the original elite. maybe the fit together in a way that is similar to the graphics of the original game and you have to unlock a 3d or 4d puzzle. There is a whole new theory for people to try to unlock. ;d Maybe that is raxxla. The puzzle itself.
