Got excited, honked a random system about, oh, 8000ly from Sol, got a red error that said "scan data corrupted" in place of the normal blue "24 objects found" or whatever.
I was like omg! But then the game said I lost connection to the matchmaking servers and crashed. Boo.

See! If my "theory" from a couple of pages back is correct (that Raxxla is just stepping away from the game screen and enjoying real life) then you just found Raxxla! Game crashed forcing you back into the real world, lol.
