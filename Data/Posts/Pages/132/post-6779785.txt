I believe if there was any special piece of scripts attached to any of the systems or anything containing the Raxxla word, unlike all the other plain barren systems, it would have hit the radars of the people who do the data mining/game file digging gig. Considering FD wouldn't go such depths to create a web of scripts about and cleverly encode them all and especially stick a bunch of curious lines to those systems without anyone realising, I conclude the chances for stumbling into any leads in the what-e-veraxxla systems doesn't look too bright.
