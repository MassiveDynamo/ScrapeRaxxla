For those interested in AHTW related searches, here is the sheet I dervied in January searching the then extant EDSM database for:

M class Star
Asteroid Belt
GG class III with 8th moons (in this case only Xh - not moons of moons etc.)

GG8s Class III Mstar primary
docs.google.com

I'm planning a looser search without the 8th moons - just M+Ast+GG III

Please feel free to finish off the mapping in the sheet - I stopped after doing a few as most GG class III were Blue, and not Blue-Green - I wanted to find a B-G one to identify the type and the other attributes, but haven't really come across one.
