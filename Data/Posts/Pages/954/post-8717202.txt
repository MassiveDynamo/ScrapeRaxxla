If Raxxla is an alien structure in space (so it is of alien origin and accessible without horizons), what space structure would be more impressive than the Dyson Sphere? It may also have some sort of the "ringworld" section so people live there like on the paradize planet, as it is said in the original novel.

And if FDev were going to put Dyson Sphere somewhere in their RL-based galaxy, what place would be more obvious than KIC 8462852? Especially in 2015

There are 9 stations in ED with "Boyajian" in their names. Boyajian is an astrononer who discovered KIC 8462852 light fluctuations. Why so big honour for her?

KIC 8462852 can not be found via the galaxy map, and its other names too, but we know where it should be and its spectral class. So i have scanned all F-class stars in that area, and then L-class too in case if Dyson Spehere looks like L-star. Found nothing so far
