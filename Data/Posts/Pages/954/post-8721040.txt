what place would be more obvious than KIC 8462852

Well yes when you put it like that, I mean, well....

I tried HIP 1984, I thought that was the obvious one

Maybe I'm wrong, correct me, but don't you think that the developers are helping some factions of players in search of something new, solving certain riddles? For example, they give keys to decrypt the signal, or hint to them how to do it, or help with the search for anomalies. I just mean that I am afraid that they will help them find raxxla...

Dont worry, I think the fdev led ones (UAs, Guardians, Thargs etc) were all aimed at the community at large with GalNet and videos & LS. There have been hints given on the forums to threads that are either getting real close or have hit a dead end and seem to have stopped. I dont think they will 'leak' to a specific group as much as to a specific place if there are any clues (maybe clues to DW, none to Raxxla) eg Twitter, FB, these forums ( lol couldn't resist it), LS hint or clue, maybe even some magazine article to be found.

its also unlikely that anything of any interest won't be found by someone and eventually posted on the forum.

The parent's grief, the lover's woe, and the yearning of our vagabond hearts.
Two planets in orbit of eachother, never to embrace?

I like this interpretation of system bodies or planets.

The parents grief - dead son / dead Sun (LYT?)
The lovers woe - binary orbiting never to meet or separated by a BH or god forbid 2 asteroid fields that used to be planets?
The yearning of our vagabond hearts - gravity pulling them into BH?
