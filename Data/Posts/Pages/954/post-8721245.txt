Dont worry, I think the fdev led ones (UAs, Guardians, Thargs etc) were all aimed at the community at large with GalNet and videos & LS. There have been hints given on the forums to threads that are either getting real close or have hit a dead end and seem to have stopped. I dont think they will 'leak' to a specific group as much as to a specific place if there are any clues (maybe clues to DW, none to Raxxla) eg Twitter, FB, these forums ( lol couldn't resist it), LS hint or clue, maybe even some magazine article to be found.

So, have you tried running any anagrams of “Chief Technician Rory Webster”??
