I see there’s an Imperial call out for exotic goods for Harold’s funeral, including Lavian brandy. Two thoughts occur:
1) Good grief! it will push the price up and make it difficult to find on the supermarket shelves! and
2) What does he want it for? He’s dead! Perhaps they’re going to pickle him in it?
Gosh, what a way to go!
