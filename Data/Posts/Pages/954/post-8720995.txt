Having a new insight on the toast, it isn't a map to find Raxxla, but a map to find their station. This may invalidate the idea of being near the 8th moon of a gas giant.

To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies!
Star orbiting black hole?

To the whisperer in witchspace, the siren of the deepest void!
I'm not up on my exploring, don't black holes whisper/sing? Or is that a NS?

The parent's grief, the lover's woe, and the yearning of our vagabond hearts.
Two planets in orbit of eachother, never to embrace?
