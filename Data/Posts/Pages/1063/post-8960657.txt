Yep, I only today looked up Wikipedia for the Veil Nebula, and there's of course NGC 6960 = Witch's Broom.

But I don't think there's a Northern Veil Nebula in the game, I think it's just a "fake name" which can be used to find "The Witch".
Why do we need north veil tho? i just joined into this raxxla research
