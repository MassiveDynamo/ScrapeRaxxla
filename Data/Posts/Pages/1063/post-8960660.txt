SIFI B24-5 is actually pretty close
You have to experiment as much as you can, think as much outside the box as possible, perhaps there is some neighbour star that is so obviously a "hint" that you need to fly towards it. Just note that you actually never arrive at another system by flying in supercruise.

EDIT: corrected star to system
