Just note that you actually never arrive at another star by flying in supercruise

Technically you can, you cant arrive at another system using SC which is what I think you mean. Some systems have a secondary star system you can fly to in SC, some of them unless I keep bumping into the same one have a Gliese in them which I think is when they are too close together to generate it on the GalMap so you actually get 2 systems in one instead of 1 'normal' binary system. (on the edge of my physics here so be lenient )
