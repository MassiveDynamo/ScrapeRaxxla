Dont kill my dreams, please! 400bn minus 1....possibly. Give me that at least


Technically you can, you cant arrive at another system using SC which is what I think you mean. Some systems have a secondary star system you can fly to in SC, some of them unless I keep bumping into the same one have a Gliese in them which I think is when they are too close together to generate it on the GalMap so you actually get 2 systems in one instead of 1 'normal' binary system. (on the edge of my physics here so be lenient )
Yes, corrected, I meant system.

If it's true that the 52 signals are not findable, as FrakesAnim said, then the Sifi-system just became much more interesting; so there's hope.

EDIT: Ah, I'm stupid, it's 50 bodies (49+1 star), so this would be 2 signals
