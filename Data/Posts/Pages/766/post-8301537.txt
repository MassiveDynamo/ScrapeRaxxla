I think we have concluded this by looking back at how the Thargoids & other pieces of lore have been rewritten. I tend to agree with HZ though, the 5 or so novels at release time (re)defined most of the new canon. And this is how we have concluded by ourselves.

I recently dug into John Harper's videos and backstory. His journey from idea to concepts, blogs and updated info from the Writers Forum. It is interesting to hear what he and other writers discussed at the time as well as where MB put his foot down. (From his blogs & videos).
It's clear that some areas were completely cut off as "don't go there" while others appears as having been redefined later (in context of what Drew W. have told us).

If you want, you may have a look at Harper's video, kickstarter & blogs.
3 video references + my notes.






















































It was a nice story to follow, especially in context of how all the lore has evolved and the release of ED itself.
I just haven't had the time to buy & read his "And Here The Wheel" publication yet. Which I will.

Spotted an error in your précis, he actually said “Raxxla itself, the mystery, who's rumours and sightings seem to ebb and flow on a 50 year cycle and we're approaching that 50-year peak”

So his concept was that Raxxla was a wandering planet (or perhaps a comet?) on a 50 year orbit. I find it interesting that FD didn’t allow this (DW said all writers were told by FD to avoid the topic of Raxxla) but made some alternative suggestions.

Oh, and interesting that there were some indigogo ED book ideas that presumably didn’t get the funding, but didn’t look at those links.
