Anybody any idea where DJ gets this quote from that MB said there will be no clues, where did MB say that previously that DJ is referring to? What was said if anything by MB at that point as well as 'no clues'? Is it all lost to folklore now or is there a record somewhere?

MB usd to come into the old Canon threads and drop interesting little comments (that never seemed to be actual clues), so it could have been said there, but they seem to have been lost in the forum “sanitisation”.
