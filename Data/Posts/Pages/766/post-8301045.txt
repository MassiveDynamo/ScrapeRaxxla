The most well-kept secrets on the age of discoveries were maps, navigation markers and shortcuts. Check the V. da Gama, Columbus and others. I think the easy and viable way for Raxxla to be in-game is to be a shortcut (or network of shortcuts) that are activated under strict conditions and/or some randomness (for Randomius). Where to find it.... that's anyone's guess. My guess is Ra, and the old Elite worlds that are not part of the old worlds screenshot. At the other end, maybe the permit locked regions or guardian sites scattered conveniently around the galaxy. The mechanics should be simple. The right target, a jump... A wormhole could be in-game with little to none code trace. (my guess)
