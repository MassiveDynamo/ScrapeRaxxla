I believe what they did was take some parts and still use it on the game. They may say the books are non - cannon but they never up right say parts of it are true. If you take a look a look at the Elite: The Dark Wheel book it still shares variable information you could even cross reference with Premonition, for instance the clones and Teorga which is referred to as the Clone world. olive skinned, dark eyes. with spike hair woman is still part of the cannon.

For all we know some of the stuff still pertains to the story because of hard written history they can't undo. Which could still mean something no matter how little it is still remain relevant.

Maybe we should be looking for olive skinned, dark eyes, with spikey hair women as mission givers to work for
