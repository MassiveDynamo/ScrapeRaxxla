Only started reading reclamation, as soon as i finish it i also just got premonition and out of the dark. Perhaps by then i will have some decent speculation on some overlooked nuance. At least i hope.

We can but hope there are clues in the books, but remember that Drew Wagar (Reclamation & Premonition) and the other authors were not given any details about Raxxla and told to stay off that subject. The only one with any knowledge was Michael Brookes himself. Re-read his book (Legacy) the other week & couldnâ€™t spot any clue.
