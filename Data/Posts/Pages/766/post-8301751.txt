breaks scanner as thargoids do
...tried to feed it by mining asteroid near it - don't eat
this thing can fly itself, also close to ship it can control my engines. If i try to "mine" this thing it turns engines so i go close to it to "hit" and it drains shield.
If you just fly direct to impact, you just pass through.

Maybe it need xeno scanner installed? >:
