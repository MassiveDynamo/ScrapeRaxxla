What was said if anything by MB at that point as well as 'no clues'? Is it all lost to folklore now or is there a record somewhere?

.., and I haven't found any reference to how he'd have come up with the 'there will be no clues' question in that interview to ask MB.

MB usd to come into the old Canon threads and drop interesting little comments (that never seemed to be actual clues), so it could have been said there, but they seem to have been lost in the forum “sanitisation”.
I know MB said that as well, but I couldn't find that statement again yesterday. However, Braben has also been clear on this in the past.
MB's statement was interpreted in two ways previously. Some thought it was just regarding a particular interview. Other thought it was more in general that there would be no clues given. Many assumed there was not more hints (facilitation) coming after that.

But I think we're also missing the point. We know MB carefully chooses his words.
MB said they had to try "make it a tiny bit obvious", not that it was too obvious as we previously may have thought.
Hence two conclusions may be drawn from this:
Raxxla is meant to be found. By us, the players. It appears they have not made it inaccessible then.
They even facilitated finding it somehow. Whether this is the Codex articles and something more, time will tell.
This also goes speaks against all who thinks Raxxla is not in game or is not meant to be found.
