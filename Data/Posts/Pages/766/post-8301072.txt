Maybe we should be looking for olive skinned, dark eyes, with spikey hair women as mission givers to work for

Ah, good idea, but the spiky-haired woman (dark eyes, olive skin, spiky coloured hair-Premonition, Alyssia?) was only one member of TDW. There were also Rebecca (brown hair & brown eyes from Reclamation), Salomé (shoulder-length straight dark hair, eyes were grey with a hint of blue- Reclamation), Luko (can’t find a good description other than short & muscular,salt-and-pepper moustache and beard framed a swarthy face),
...and possibly Emperor Arissa (brown hair, grey eyes-Premonition)...

The grey eyes & brown hair seem typical of clones, but not all clones would be TDW. And didnt Aryssia die with Rebecca at Tionisla graveyard?
Edit: perhaps not, can’t find that bit. But found that Octavia (another of the clones) had grey eyes but blonde hair.
