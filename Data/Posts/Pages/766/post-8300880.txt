Anybody any idea where DJ gets this quote from that MB said there will be no clues, where did MB say that previously that DJ is referring to? What was said if anything by MB at that point as well as 'no clues'? Is it all lost to folklore now or is there a record somewhere?
I've trawled through a lot of 'old' videos from Elite's conception backer days till now just recently looking for tip bits, and I haven't found any reference to how he'd have come up with the 'there will be no clues' question in that interview to ask MB.

Anyone else?
