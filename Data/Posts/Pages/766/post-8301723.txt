Ok been thinking more about the second line of the toast to Raxxla.

I’m just stabbing around with what was available in 1.0 release, what was on offer.

I mentioned that the frameshit drive could be the whisperer. However the whisperer could relate to the Alliance, they created it but don’t manufacture it, Sirius does. So in some respect that could mean that they are the whisperer in whitchspace tech. I’m guessing Alioth as a destination target to fly towards. The deepest void though 1ly? Or more. The jewel could be earth, shin or even a giant potato. Oh the madness I LOVE IT.
