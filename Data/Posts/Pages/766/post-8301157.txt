So I did read through the first 100 pages of this extraordinarily cool and entertaining thread and jumped here to the current end to see if there was found something a bit nearer but sadly obviously still not!?

However, seeing this interview snippet again and hear the statement that there might be something I am wondering if you smart guys did investigate the video as such (like the background, his pullover, ...)?

Only read 100 pages???
You’ve missed the best bit!!!
AND we’ve found loads of things!!!
See the remaining pages!!!
Just not what we we’re looking for though
