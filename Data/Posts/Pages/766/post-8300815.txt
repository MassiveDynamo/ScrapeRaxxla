MB: "... That is true, but you have to make some of it a tiny little bit obvious, but so people know what they are doing. But, there is nothing to be revealed at this stage."

Anybody any idea where DJ gets this quote from that MB said there will be no clues, where did MB say that previously that DJ is referring to? What was said if anything by MB at that point as well as 'no clues'? Is it all lost to folklore now or is there a record somewhere?
