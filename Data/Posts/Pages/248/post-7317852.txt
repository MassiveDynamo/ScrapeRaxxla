I saw two ships over the FR sites, an Orca over Alpha and a Krait (not sure?) over Gamma when i was there yesterday. Hung around for a moment but didn't know exactly what to look for, so i decided to be on my way. I've altered my route a bit after re-reading the codex and won't go straight to the Zurara. The "jewel burning on the brow of the mother of galaxies" piqued my interest, so i've bookmarked a few very bright stars in the galaxy map around the Formidine Rift (the ones that can leave a distinct glow even when you filter out all star types). I've also set my route to include mostly M and T-Tauri stars (in case the illustration for the Dark Wheel codex entry is any clue, although in all fairness the DW station might not be orbiting the primary star of its system), and blue ones (O, B, A, Wolf-Rayet, White Dwarf, Neutron), because well, they look cool and i find they often have interesting/varied stuff around them exploration-wise.

I'll tell you if i stumble upon anything special. I'll be slow, i don't play much these days.
