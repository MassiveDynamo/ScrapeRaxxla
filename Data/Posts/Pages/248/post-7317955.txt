Hello there,

i'm off to sleep so i won't be able to read answers until my lunch break tomorrow, but i couldn't resist asking the question directly here (sorry if it's already been investigated, i've only started replaying a bit in recent days and am outdated on many topics):

Is the "To the whisperer in witch-space, the siren of the deepest void!" part of the Raxxla codex entry something that was known beforehand? Because it sounds new to me and... it also sounds an awful lot like what is described in the messages left on Formidine Rift alpha site:

- "Could have sworn i heard some weird voices in the last jump" (message 2/6).
- "A siren song" (message 5/6).

Has it already been investigated/dismissed? I'm currently heading straight to the Zurara from FR delta site, after which i plan to go as far as i can into the void, following the Riedquat-Reorte axis
Should i look for something in particular while in the region? (i play by tiny bits on an irregular schedule)

Notes:

- i made sure i was allied with the Dark Wheel before i left the bubble, just in case some mission would pop up later.
- i'm currently flying on a multirole Conda equipped for exploration/mining with only a 50+Ly range, so i may not be able to access everything.

Thanks in advance

Now that is intresting.
Never been to formidine rift, i'll try that approach now and 'll record the witchspace sound to see the spectrum of it, already was on path that way, to check NGC 7822 nebula, and heart and soul nebula.
Being in one direction with H&S is another reason to check that clue.


As a side note: been using audacity to records ingame sound and look into spectrum, may there be another tool which is better?
