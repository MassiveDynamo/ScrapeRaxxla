I don't know if we're still on the Antares thing, but I did some Extremely Rigorous Science and I believe it's just a visual bug:

I'm heading to Rasalgethi, another red supergiant, to see whether it occurs here too.
Edit: Can confirm it happens at Rasalgethi too: https://i.imgur.com/LgONE5i.jpg

I am pretty confident this is a bug. This also happened to me when I was far out from Betelgeuse.
