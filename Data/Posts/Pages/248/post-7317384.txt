Is the "To the whisperer in witch-space, the siren of the deepest void!" part of the Raxxla codex entry something that was known beforehand? Because it sounds new to me and... it also sounds an awful lot like what is described in the messages left on Formidine Rift alpha site:

- "Could have sworn i heard some weird voices in the last jump" (message 2/6).
- "A siren song" (message 5/6).

Has it already been investigated/dismissed? I'm currently heading straight to the Zurara from FR delta site, after which i plan to go as far as i can into the void, following the Riedquat-Reorte axis
Should i look for something in particular while in the region? (i play by tiny bits on an irregular schedule)

Notes:

- i made sure i was allied with the Dark Wheel before i left the bubble, just in case some mission would pop up later.
- i'm currently flying on a multirole Conda equipped for exploration/mining with only a 50+Ly range, so i may not be able to access everything.

Thanks in advance

I'm going to that system now, and try to jump in from every system. Let's see if there is anything out of the ordinairy in witchspace.
