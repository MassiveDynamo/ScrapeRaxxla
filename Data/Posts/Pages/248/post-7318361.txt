The Formadine will have nothing to to with Raxxla. It was Drew Wagars own story that FDev allowed him to have fun with. Even he said he doesn't know where Raxxla is.

The Formidine story as it is - agreed, won't be connected, in a way as Raxxla is not a part of it.
But it might have some hints that were not a crucial part of original story and because of that got overlooked. Or might be just added.

That siren link is just too tempting not to follow it.


My take is: we are looking at a series of hints scattered by DW recently (before sanctioning an article about them being added to CODEX) throughout the galaxy, and it's just a matter of finding a correct key as to where to start and how to follow those hints. In the end we find their core base (might need to be already allied to their faction too) on which there are hints as to where Raxxla itslef is (and it's connection to The Club?).
