The Formidine story as it is - agreed, won't be connected, in a way as Raxxla is not a part of it.
But it might have some hints that were not a crucial part of original story and because of that got overlooked. Or might be just added.

That siren link is just too tempting not to follow it.


My take is: we are looking at a series of hints scattered by DW recently (before sanctioning an article about them being added to CODEX) throughout the galaxy, and it's just a matter of finding a correct key as to where to start and how to follow those hints. In the end we find their core base (might need to be already allied to their faction too) on which there are hints as to where Raxxla itslef is (and it's connection to The Club?).

Oh I GARUNTEE The Club know where Raxxla is, but The Club is also part of Elites bigger story not just DWs book... at least that's how I view it. I think The Club is FDevs thing and not just DWs thing. They have waaay to much what's the word... "Control" over the entire galaxy to NOT be a thing.

The Club know where Raxxla is, maybe FDev gave drew hints to put in to the logs, we don't know, you'd have to ask him, he's pretty active so you probably could. Still, where ever Raxxla is, we don't know, Drew doesn't know, and I bet only a VERY few people in FDev know where it is. But something tells me, that if we do find it, it's not gonna be what we think it is. Because.

A Planet, that can change control of ENTIRE factions, with portals that lead to huge wealth and control and just... it's a big. MCGuffin.
