I forgot to take any screenshots whilst at the crash site, but here are the screenshots I have of the messages:

As I said, the ID on the crashed ship was MD-02. There were some manufactured materials about the place and a data point, but no cargo racks. There was a wrecked SRV at the site, but with no signal of it's own, and right under the nose of the Conda. I did eventually find a small amount of wreckage some way off in the mountains, but there was nothing selectable there, just some shards of metal in the ground. I don't know if there are still logs to find, but if they are, they're not well signposted, and there was no signal from them when mapping the planet.

Additionally, it suffered from the bug where the game claimed it was a guardian signal whilst on the ground.

Thanks, will update LP sheet later.
Think that bug will be around until the next update.
