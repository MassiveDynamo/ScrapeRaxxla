This is my deepest void investigation, led me to a system with a BH.

When you use the FSS on a black hole, there is a repeating wave form with a few echo (whispers?) sounds, has anyone already analysed these?

I wouldn't know where to start, but didn't the probe get deciphered like this somehow.

Any help on how I can do this?

I'm also thinking of jumping through the BH to another system, that is if I can find any that might be remotely related to parents grief or lovers woe in range.

Thanks
