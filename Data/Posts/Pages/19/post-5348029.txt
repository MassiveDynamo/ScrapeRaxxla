"A place that isn't a place, a door that is also the key. The myth." Sounds like a cryptic crossword clue, my guess is to replace the nouns with synonyms, and maybe an antonym of place for "not a place".

Looking at the OED, one definition of "place" is interesting:
The position of a celestial object on the celestial sphere, esp. allowing for the effects of precession, parallax, aberration, nutation of the earth's axis, proper motion of the body, etc.

"The key" may be metaphorical, such as meaning the solution or the important thing to understand, or be like a key to a map. "A door" may be an anagram of something important, or provide the solution itself. Equally "The myth" may be an anagram of the key.

And my favourite idea so far - the ED universe is a place that is virtual, therefore not really a place, and the main menu of the game is a gateway to the universe of ED, CQC, the training missions etc, accessed via the "Enter" key on my keyboard! The myth is that there's a place called Raxxla at all, because really there isn't!
