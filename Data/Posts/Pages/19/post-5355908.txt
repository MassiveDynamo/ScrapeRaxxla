I wouldn't say that searching for Raxxla right now is a lost cause. This is THE big puzzle of the Elite universe.

Raxxla.

Everyone and their dog knows about Raxxla.

When Jason Ryder, moments before his death, spoke that word to his son Alex ... Alex had no idea what the word meant. It was foreign to him. Totally alien.

Flash forward to the year 3303 and Raxxla is now a brand name (and no, I don't mean guitar pedals).

We have "The Children of Raxxla" advertising the place in their faction name. Salome speaking about Raxxla from Beagle Point and stating that it was first mentioned "in Federation data banks on Earth in 2814".

I just really have to wonder ... what happened in the galaxy that something so obscure that Alex Ryder had never heard of suddenly becomes so prominent that an independent minor faction includes it in their name?

I, well...Now that you mention it, it is highly unusual. Years ago people were killed if they had even a hunch. Now? It seems Galnet even covers the progress.
