Think that would be pointless; we have afaik no way of interacting with anything in witchspace. Thargoids do, but since we're not Thargoids yet, then...

Why would it be pointless? Pointless to search maybe... Braben said that Raxxla exists in the game and that Frontier knows where it is. That doesn't mean that Raxxla exists in anyplace that is accessible to us, the players, at this particular stage in the game. I suspect that Frontier would keep Raxxla pretty well out of our reach at this stage. Could be hidden behind a permit lock, a system too distant to reach with our current jump ranges.

I definitely wouldn't exclude the possibility of Raxxla being hidden away in hyperspace ... Frontier can claim to know exactly where Raxxla is without actually having to implemented it in game.
