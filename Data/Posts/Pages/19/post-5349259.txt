Thanks a lot! I will rep you once I'm in front of a pc.

Indeed, as we know it's in-game, there has to be a hint somewhere, even if it's very obscure and faint. I will try to sift through all the info on those links once I'm back from my trip.

Might be an idea to search for specific keywords, like Raxxla (doh), Ryder, gate, etc...

In 2015 I tried searching for stars older than the galaxy that we know of following just this lead, but nothing came out of it.

There are indeed stars in our own galaxy older than the galaxy itself, probably caught sometime, but when I reached some of them, all were procgen and none was special whatsoever. Gave up on that lead...

So, who/what are INRA's closest allies? My mind still wanders back to some connection with founders world. Also, there is a theroy about rouge planets being habitable.

Hmm. I wonder, if these guardians are indeed the 'owners' of Raxxla; You should be able to cull it's location from the Monoliths.
