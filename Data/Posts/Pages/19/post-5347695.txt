All official fiction.
GalNet databases.
Thanks a lot! I will rep you once I'm in front of a pc.

Indeed, as we know it's in-game, there has to be a hint somewhere, even if it's very obscure and faint. I will try to sift through all the info on those links once I'm back from my trip.

Might be an idea to search for specific keywords, like Raxxla (doh), Ryder, gate, etc...

So what is the fluff? The part about a world older than the galaxy or that INRA owns it?
In 2015 I tried searching for stars older than the galaxy that we know of following just this lead, but nothing came out of it.

There are indeed stars in our own galaxy older than the galaxy itself, probably caught sometime, but when I reached some of them, all were procgen and none was special whatsoever. Gave up on that lead...
