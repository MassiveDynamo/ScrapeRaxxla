You could start from Lave headed for Shinrarta Dezhra.

Hyperspace. When you are in hyperspace you do not exist in any place in-game (or in-universe for that matter). You are between instances. You've passed through a door from one instance that acts as the key to loading the next one.

Back in 1985, after reading The Dark Wheel and then playing the game a while, I imagined that Raxxla could exist inside witchspace itself. From The Dark Wheel:

"Faraway is a tunnel, like any other tunnel. Inside that tunnel is the realm called Witch-Space, a magic place, a place where the normal rules of the Universe don't necessarily work."

A perfect place to pack a planet like Raxxla.

Think that would be pointless; we have afaik no way of interacting with anything in witchspace. Thargoids do, but since we're not Thargoids yet, then...
