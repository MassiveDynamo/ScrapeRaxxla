Placing Raxxla out of our reach would be just mean. But you're right, witchspace, permit locked systems, even regions like COL 70 Sector is a possibility. And nobody has promised we could find it.

Well that kills the fun. It makes sense though. Set hilariously high expectations, take 10 years to tell the tale as it needs to be, laugh as this thread goes nuts as we realise the ruse (like a goldfish gainiing the concept of an ever expanding enclosure). Time will tell.
