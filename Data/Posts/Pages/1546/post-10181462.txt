My proposition is; if this orientation is correct, then it places the Norse underworld within the same alignment as that of the Greek Underworld, if true then this theory ties the ‘Yggdrasil’ theory directly into the ‘Underworld’ theory and the two correspond.
The Norse cosmogony is layered with Midgard in the Middle. You probably also want to factor 3 key systems: Alioth (contains planet Bifrost and station Golden Gate), Bifrost, and Bilfost. These are the rainbow bridge that connected the Earthly realms (Midgard) to heaven (Asgard). With any luck, these would hopefully be approximately parallel to the true axis.

The Norse Cosmogony per Niflheim Wikipedia:


Start at Nifelhel. It is an alternative name for the Norse underworld or Hel. Pretty sure there is a Nastrond system and Utgard. Hopefully, this is enough points to test the true axis of Axis Mundi/Yggradasil. Be warned: the tree is not straight in most renditions and sometimes there are several locations at a given level. I hope this helps.
