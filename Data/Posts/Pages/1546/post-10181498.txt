Any ideas on what the dots represent on the map? If memory serves there is a secondary set nearer the core of the galaxy. I will try to get better screenshots when I play.
I'm sorry, but I think we're going in circles.

The Quest To Find Raxxla
yup - and I think they are filled with crazed Maenads from Wicca's world ;) Party time! The girls are already there! You get the Lavian brandy! Iâ€™ll bring the beer! Now just got to find the venue! ðŸ˜‰ðŸ•º

One more time.

To me the Raxxla logo (as well as other logos) just schematically show the same thing as the picture on the right. In Raxxla's case, it's simply the WHOLE GALACTIC, i.e. it's essentially something you have to look for in the galaxy.
When the codex came up, it became possible to swap information with other players in the finds section.
