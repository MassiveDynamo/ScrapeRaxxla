It’s a fascinating subject because Greek culture is visa versa influenced by early pan-European migration. So I agree there is a common thread.

In game - however it seems evident to me, these systems were placed specifically, in some abstract Yggdrasil relationship with a clear up/down orientation. I suspect it is the scaffolding for some narrative (which utilises mixed references and inspirations); my theory is that the Greek underworld- which is in game, and those representing the text in the Codex (cities of gold etc) were like wise placed specifically by that author so that they correlate on this scaffolding.

My issue is, some of these Yggdrasil systems don’t seem to be in the correct location, based on various illustrations (of which there are many), I wonder if the scaffolding matches, if you just shift your perspective? Or is the concurrent alignment correct? Or if it doesn’t really matter!

Im not debating theology; If this is true it has great significance. If it doesn’t well it was fun mapping it and obviously it’s just part of an arbitrary naming catalog; but I highly doubt it.
This is why a part of me hopes we never find our goal, this thread throws up so much new stuff in my life its amazing.
If 10 years ago whilst sitting on a flight case backstage hoping the singer was sober enough to actually perform and not start fighting the drummer, you would have said id be reading Paradise Lost i would have thought you were mad
