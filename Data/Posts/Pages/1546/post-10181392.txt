just putting this out there...but why is our search usually limited by most to 200ly while Phobos (Generation ship) is 272ly out from Sol
Good question. There is also the matter of having fuel scoops definitively by 2411 ("Logistical Nightmare" in Beta Hydri). That said, Sirius Corporation apparently originated in Sol (see Li Qin Jao research team reference in "Early Hyperspace" in Tau Ceti). Sirius Corporation moved to the Sirius system sometime shortly after Raxxla is first written about by Art Tornvquist in Tau Ceti (approximately 2300 - 2330 - sorry but don't remember exactly).

The reason I mention that is fuel scoops could, at least in theory, push distance traveled to nearly the edge of the galaxy given the 66 year gap between 2230 and 2296 ("Early Colonies" in Altair). In modern eras, a trip to the core without a carrier takes several months of dedicated travel without much distraction.

The short version of why l suspect the Raxxla search has been historically less than 200 LY: it was very hard to prove a very far distance of travel. This was all the more true of us being told Hyperspace wasn't really commercially viable until 3297 (however there are certainly counter-examples).
