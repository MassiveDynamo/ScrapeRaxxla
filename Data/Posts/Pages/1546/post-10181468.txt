An interesting aside: there are two tribes of Norse gods - Vanir and Aesir. To achieve peace, a Vanir (Freya) married an Aesir (Odin). This is paralleled in Greek mythology (though not by way of marriage) that to achieve peace at the end of the Titanomachy either Hecate or Nyx (in alternate versions) ally with the Olympic Pantheon to end the war. Hecate and Nyx were the only Titans honoured by the Olympic Pantheon of gods. Similarly, in the Abrahamic faiths it might be more accurate to say Lucifer (or the equivalent thereof) is the overzealous enforcer of God and not the opposition. Going back to the Greek mythology, Zeus and Hades are brothers who actually got along pretty well.
