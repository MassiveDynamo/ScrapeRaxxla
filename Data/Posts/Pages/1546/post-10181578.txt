Just slightly off topic and may not be relevant but in paganism there is no heaven and hell, this was a Christian invention.
Honestly, it probably is hugely relevant. For most cultures the underworld has been a place of cleansing not punishment. In many of these epics, someone must descend into the other realm to learn a lesson that then empowers them on the their journey which is also why I mentioned that historically the relationship has been complex but not necessarily antagonistic.
