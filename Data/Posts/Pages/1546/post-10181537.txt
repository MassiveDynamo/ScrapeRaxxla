Earthly realms (Midgard) to heaven (Asgard)
Just slightly off topic and may not be relevant but in paganism there is no heaven and hell, this was a Christian invention.
Midgard (Abred for most Druids) is the terrestrial realm but we have a reverse psychology, we dont see where we are as the 'true' realm.
For us Gwynfyd (has other names) is the true realm, the realm of spirit, we inhabit the Earth as custodians.
Ceugant is the realm of the Gods (Asgard) and is unobtainable to mortals or even spirits.
This is where it differs slightly from our Northern brothers and sisters as they believe they can attain life amongst the Gods.
The most common name for the Underworld in groves around Europe is Annwn, but this is not a bad place, its the place all must travel in the circle - Annwn - Abred - Gwynfyd and round again hence why 3 is such an important number.
