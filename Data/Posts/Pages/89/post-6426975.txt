If it's in keeping with the myths and legends then they wouldn't be myths and legends. They would be firm facts we could work on.

That doesn’t really make sense. It can be fully in keeping with the myths and legends, and they will still be myths and legends. That only changes when we actually find out some facts. Until we know the facts, then the myths and legends are just that and how factually accurate they are is unknown. (Unless FD directly states to what extent it’s in keeping with the myths and legends, obviously.)
