Same, that changes things quite a bit.

Nick work Makahi!



I read somewhere, can't remember where, I think it was the Authors Notes in And Here The Wheel (maybe) that the writers were told specifically that the one topic they couldn't write about was Raxxla, which is why AHTW goes after Soonil but still wraps in a lot of old Raxxla lore.

I took this to basically mean "we've got plans for Raxxla", basically.



good to hear someone with access to the writers pack say that. That's something I've been speculating about for ages.



That is interesting. It means that essentially the Club's influence is potentially far more wrapped in the games narrative than we previously thought.



I wonder if Drew means that the part of Makahi's question regarding the discovery scanner is 'a good question indeed'? as in, maybe the discovery scanner doesn't show us everything in a system... If that's the case then... uuuugh it'll be impossible, that means literally matching up the planet visuals with what the discovery scanner says...

Oh dear, back to visually scanning for planets by parallax.

Cross-posting my comment from alien archeology&tinfoilery thread re DrewW’s clarification of the Club: That’s good to know, though I think the way the catering CG (after Salomé’s demise) was constructed (either to support it or to hinder it, with no way to get further information on the attendees & therefore membership of The Club) means that they are intended to remain only a background part of the storyline (at least for now).
