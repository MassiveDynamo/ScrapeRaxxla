Interesting. I assumed "The Club" was something Drew created for the book and not something bigger. I have to rethink some things.

Same, that changes things quite a bit.

Nick work Makahi!

Raxxla : I was told, in person, by David Braben in 2014 that it was in the game and Frontier Devs knew where it was.

I was never part of any background lore that I was made aware of or read - so I personally don't know where it is.

I read somewhere, can't remember where, I think it was the Authors Notes in And Here The Wheel (maybe) that the writers were told specifically that the one topic they couldn't write about was Raxxla, which is why AHTW goes after Soonil but still wraps in a lot of old Raxxla lore.

I took this to basically mean "we've got plans for Raxxla", basically.

My own guess is that it can't be that far out of the core worlds, as it was reachable by the far slower hyperdrive systems of the previous game periods (prior to the FSD).

So good to hear someone with access to the writers pack say that. That's something I've been speculating about for ages.

"The Club" was a lore construct provided by Frontier that I used in the novel, thus I am not aware of the full scope of their powers.

That is incredibly interesting. It means that essentially the Club's influence is potentially far more wrapped in the games narrative than we previously thought.

All I can say is that the question regarding the 'Permit Locked' systems... is a very good question indeed.

I wonder if Drew means that the part of Makahi's question regarding the discovery scanner is 'a good question indeed'? as in, maybe the discovery scanner doesn't show us everything in a system... If that's the case then... uuuugh it'll be impossible, that means literally matching up the planet visuals with what the discovery scanner says...
