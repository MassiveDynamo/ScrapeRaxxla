Sothis was first discovered for EDSM by J. Calvert (Joshua) on Mar 15, 2015, 2:31:13 PM.

1st mention of Sothis in Galnet appears to have been in a PowerPlay article in which Utopia was planning to establish a Commune there: https://community.elitedangerous.com/en/galnet/31-JUL-3301

2nd mention of Sothis in Galnet. Also PowerPlay. Utopia's efforts to establish a presence in Sothis faltered: https://community.elitedangerous.com/en/galnet/07-AUG-3301

3rd mention. Sothis Crystalline Gold. Interesting (almost alchemical) Rare commodity that was hinted at having future applications: https://community.elitedangerous.com/en/galnet/25-SEP-3301

4th mention. "Li Yong-Rui was disappointed, as deals that would have incorporated additional systems into the Sirius portfolio fell through. Sirius's investors remain optimistic about the corporation's future performance, as deals with wealthy systems lie on the horizon. With the ongoing study of Sothis Crystalline Gold, Sirius stocks are soaring." - https://community.elitedangerous.com/en/galnet/02-OCT-3301

5th mention. "Earlier this year, the Sirius Corporation expanded into the systems of HIP 8396, Almagest, Sothis, Ceos, and Robigo." - https://community.elitedangerous.com/en/galnet/15-OCT-3301

I don't think we should ignore the Sothis/Sirius connections.
