If this is the case, and unless Frontier introduces some kind of interaction with the Goids that doesn't boil down to blasting them to bits, I'll be taking my leave. Thargoids right now are pretty shallow content in my opinion and if they end up forcing that content on the entire player base ... well, I guess I'll be praying for Star Citizen.

I started to investigate the other verse last week,but a bit bogged down by hotas setup. So long since I did it for ED Im having to relearn it, and SC doesnâ€™t yet cater for hotas modifier keys but my ED setup has one on throttle & one on stick. Want to keep the two game setups aligned as far as possible
