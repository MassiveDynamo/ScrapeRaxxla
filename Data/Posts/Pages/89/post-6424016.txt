When you'll still be struggling with a pre-alpha SC , Doc, I will have already: discovered Raxxla, put a name on every single Club member and possibly be talking fluent Guardianish ...
And a retired well known penguin wielding a fishing pole instead of an axe. And granpa Jorki drinking milk instead of single malt. And Macros leaving for his third circumnavigation. And Han_Zen landing on Cass A A1 ELW.
Don't misunderstand me. I would love to be wrong ...

Whisky in warm milk is ok if you run out of Horlicks whilst on the Kessel run.
and SC is definitely only in alpha at the moment, anticipate release in 2 years time. But fun still to be had whilst alpha testing, think FD have forgotten that a game is supposed to be fun.
