Oh dear, back to visually scanning for planets by parallax.

I have a very strong feeling that this is the only way.

If Raxxla is in a system that shows up on the galaxy map and the planet it self shows up on a discovery scan it's not really obfuscated, is it?

All available info points to Raxxla being a planet. That's why I think it's the planet that is obfuscated, not the system.

Just my simple logic. Could well be flawed.


P.S. It's in Sirius.
