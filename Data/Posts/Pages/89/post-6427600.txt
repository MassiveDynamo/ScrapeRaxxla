Speaking for myself, even with the information about The Club, it still feels like Raxxla itself just isn't in game at all (yet), as have so many "assets" that were introduced with an update or being "activated" on a server tick (and then being discovered only a few hours/days later). With people actively looking for Raxxla and taking into account lore regarding travel-ranges, I am quite sure that it would have been discovered already if it really was in a non-permit locked system. "It is in game and we know where it is" isn't new and doesn't mean anything at all, if stated by DB or FDEV. I would love to be wrong though
