Sothis was put on the map after an Exploration CG held by Sirius corporation, in this particular region. Sothis and a few other systems were renamed from their generic version to their current names.
This was back in February/March 3301.

There has neve been an explanation to why Sirius Corporation wanted to expand in this direction. It's worth noting that Sothis is on a direct line from the Core, towards H&S/EAFOTS.

Reading the Wikipedia article for Sirius produces a lot of familiar names: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius

Look at the section labeled "Observational History". Sothis. Ceos. Robigo. All names connected in some way to Sirius, the Sothic cycle, etc.
