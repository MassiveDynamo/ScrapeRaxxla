Reading the Wikipedia article for Sirius produces a lot of familiar names: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius

Look at the section labeled "Observational History". Sothis. Ceos. Robigo. All names connected in some way to Sirius, the Sothic cycle, etc.

Yes, they are all there. There is even a connection to the reoccurring fungus, in the form of wheat rust.

The Sothic cycle is easy to interpret as a 'the wheels of time turns' connection.

It could also be just a play on the Sirius name, with no deeper meaning.
