Don't underestimate genetical manibulation. If there is enough combinations, you can build even a satellite from roses if you have full control over their genome.

Some technological features are cloned from viruses. Evolution and manibulated evolution have together a big role in thargoid technology and their chemistry. Our brains do exactly same analysis as thargoid sensor, which is also a combination of biological lifeforms genetically manibulated to live in symbiosis.
