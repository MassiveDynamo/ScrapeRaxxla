Well, the Thargoid structure is like an imprint on a planet surface. A bit like a rash, or an infection.

"Of those who go to excess he who exceeds in fearlessness has no name (we have said previously that many states of character have no names), but he would be a sort of madman or insensible person if he feared nothing, neither earthquakes nor the waves, as they say the Celts do not; while the man who exceeds in confidence (Tharsos) about what really is terrible is rash (Tharsus)."

It could be Thargoids read Nicomachean Ethics by Aristotle in their spare time. Remember that stuff about removal of fear glands? Also here's a really big Tharsus on Mars (It looks a bit like sunburns on my arms):
