Not sure that means it’s the name of the Thargoid structures. It could be read as ‘encountered a Thargoid Imprint’ sure, but it could equally be read as a name/description of the type of encounter (i.e. ‘a Thargoid Imprint happened’).
I think it's the structure it self. In the DSS description in this update, it's mentioned like it is: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threa...xploration-and-the-codex.451420/#post-7088359
