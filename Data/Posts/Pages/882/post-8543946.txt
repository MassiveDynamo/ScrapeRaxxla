Thargoid Machine is like 3D printer which prints genome in different types.
Then this genome is spread around and pollunated on their eggs. "It looks like star map but it is actually genetical spray." See ocean life when they breed.

There are 2 queens and king genetically and biologycally smashed together as one, the thargoid machine. Do note that thargoids build all their material from BIOLOGY. They are lifeforms.
