They are crashed or landed capital ships hit by the mycoid. I have been saying this since start...

Inside this is a breeding chamber. Thargoids are genetical engineers who manibulates their genome with the machine. The thargoid machine is 2 queens and a king just sacroficed to become a breeding machine which spills out diffent types of thargoids and pollunates them like ocean life. --- YOU ALWAYS FORGET THARGOIDS build their machines from BIOLOGY... NOT electronics... Some lifeforms ARE ALWAYS BIND to what ever they construct.... Even their OWN species.
I don't think Thargoids have kings. They are all female. The queens reproduce by copying them self or by combining their genome with another queen.
