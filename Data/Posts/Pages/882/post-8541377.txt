Yeah, agreed, I think we need to be careful over reading too much in to the perfectly normal use of a perfectly normal word.

The sudden use of it in the second set of Guardian logs, when it hadn’t been used at all in the first set, was very noticeable and interesting though, as has been remarked upon before.

(The usual ‘by’ part is omitted at the end as I can’t remember exactly who / how many have remarked upon it. I certainly have, I think @Han_Zen has as well, and I suspect others might have too.)
