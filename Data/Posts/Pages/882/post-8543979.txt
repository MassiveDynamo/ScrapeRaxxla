What we are doing when we bring those sensors, links and stuff to thargoid breeding machine is the "genome with information" -- The genome that can not survive in the area willl die and leave only that genome alive which has adapted to surroundings... This genome then is carried into the machine which combines the DNA structures and spreads the survived DNA around. This concludes with Thargoids that has adapted the surroundings they got. The pollunation is a result of biological analysis, eh.. result of evolution. The bad genome with in those 3 objects have died out and the "DNA" which survives is oriented to the "area" where the DNA was held... Adaptation to position...

So in otherwords. Thargoids use quick evolution to make different types connected to situation,,,
