It's from the old stats page(Right-Panel).

SPOILER

Probably the same in the new codex commander log.
Not sure that means it’s the name of the Thargoid structures. It could be read as ‘encountered a Thargoid Imprint’ sure, but it could equally be read as a name/description of the type of encounter (i.e. ‘a Thargoid Imprint happened’).
