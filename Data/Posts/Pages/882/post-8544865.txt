Don't underestimate genetical manibulation. If there is enough combinations, you can build even a satellite from roses if you have full control over their genome.

Some technological features are cloned from viruses. Evolution and manibulated evolution have together a big role in thargoid technology and their chemistry. Our brains do exactly same analysis as thargoid sensor, which is also a combination of biological lifeforms genetically manibulated to live in symbiosis.
Not seeing any signs that anyone’s underestimating genetic manipulation, especially in the hands of a civilisation that have been doing it for millions of years.

The point with regards to the Thargoid Sensor is just that it appears to be blended Bio and electronic, compared to other Thargoid tech.

Why would genetic engineering preclude bio/electronic hybridisation where it was desired?

Also what’s the basis of the assertion that our brains do the same analysis as the TSs? Working out what an alien civilisation label a system / body and transmitting it in a stylised code used by that alien civilisation? Plus using that stylised code to draw simple 3D line models of that alien civilisation’s ships? (I’m guessing that’s not what you meant and something’s just got lost in translation somewhere, by the way! I’m just not clear what you did actually mean. )

I think it’s also worth bearing in mind that bio/electrical hybridisation is part of ED, generally speaking. Electronic brain implants, cyborgs...
