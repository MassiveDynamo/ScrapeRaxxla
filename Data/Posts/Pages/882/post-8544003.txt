I don't think Thargoids have kings. They are all female. The queens reproduce by copying them self or by combining their genome with another queen.

Well, going to site, i see only 2 female and one drone kind. it is observable and repeatable data. 2 Red and 1 Blue

By biology definition this means... They breed in asexual way, however The blue one is male. "drone".. The major result of this is that the hive itself is all female... Just like Bees.

Did you know majority of the birds do not have the organ called P*s.. Still they reproduce as male and female...

The snails ... the one which pokes first becomes male in that moment.
