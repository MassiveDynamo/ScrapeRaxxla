Aegean Pirates Inc is a player faction, so some CMDR wrote that text..

Also LHS449 is also called CPD-46 8664 in RL

LHS 449
I believe in a prior game the system was listed as CPD-46 8664 but would have to consult some of the map tools players have made over the years. That said, I am certain the 2nd half is player-generated but the first sentence less so.

Regardless, the point is abandoned and dark have considerable gray areas. Another example of an "abandoned" station is Black Mausoleum in Beta Hydri which was left off the treaty per Wanted and Elite Encounters RPG. Does it look abandoned? Not exactly. Similarly, Ortiz Moreno City in Tau Ceti is the "destroyed" (and apparently subsequently repaired) station mentioned in the last paragraph of the Brewer Corporation codex entry. Language is social construct. The Federation may well consider LHS 449 for all practical purposes officially abandoned (it is technically still a Federal system). However, the reality is rarely that simple. Reality is rarely black or white. Learn to navigate the crossroads between no longer, now, and not yet.
