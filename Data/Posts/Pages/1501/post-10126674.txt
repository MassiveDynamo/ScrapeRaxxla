A reminder of how David Braben views Elite Dangerous per the Preface to Elite Dangerous RPG (there is lore and is awesome). Anyway, his views appear to be very close to that of a DM for TTRPGs that gained popularity in the 1980s. This is particularly noticable in the last half of the last paragraph which has the phrasing:

"Players have the ability to go unexpected directions and do unexpected things".

It may be useful to keep that in mind that he considers this as a digital live-action TTRPG of the modern era.

Add finally the current lore-master's comments that 'the payback for Raxxla would have to be pretty big' and read his face as he says it, and I'm in a mind to conclude either that:

The whole concept of Raxxla has be re-worked to fit into the current narrative - in which case we're unlikely to see it or have any route to it until the whole Thargoid story is done or:
Raxxla is something that they felt they couldn't do justice to and is in the 'too hard to fix' box.
