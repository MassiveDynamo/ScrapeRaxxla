Ive seen that quote before and unless there's a vid to go with it i highly doubt its only findable by a group of players.
Pretty much every commander i know is out there searching on their own when they get free time, would be pretty poor if it could only be accessed as a group activity.

We have to remember as well that pre-launch DB said a lot of things which never came to pass, also they were interested in group based activities being the norm, eg Explorers hiring wingmen etc to escort them etc, all pie in the sky.

Or it relate to the old method of exploration where Cmdrs scanned dark systems, maybe that would identify something as more and more Cmdrs filled in the gaps?

If that statement was accurate, it might tie in with the old PF/DW missions which did require you to be Elite, to get the permit for Shinrarta Dezhra, obviously Founders/backers got it too, but the original principle was it was gated access, so one could presume that’s what is meant here? If it’s accurate.

I don’t believe it’s context is accurate any more. The only thing that’s gated by Elite status are missions, again many of these were also made available to everyone. So if accurate, then what he was on about no long applies I presume.

I doubt Raxxla is ultimately Elite gated, because firstly there are so many players now hitting that rank very early, someone would have reported it by now and secondly it would mean FD has built some hidden mechanism, which is counterproductive, because if it only applies to 1 element, it’s a wasted resource, they would want us to find it.
