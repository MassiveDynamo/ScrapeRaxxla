Well, its kind of worse that that , in that the lore is muddied by player written content that is not curated or integrated with the body of lore that already existed. You see this in Galnets, for instance, many of which were player submissions.

Add that to the fact that the lore at launch was largely frozen, and then a whole new bunch of people picked up the story line with a new agenda, and cohesion is not to be expected.

All we can hope for in the context of this thread is that the lore and game mechanics at launch contained enough to expose the location of our target , and that subsequent changes have not obliterated information, or removed mechanics, or provided contradictory information. My confidence is not high that this is the case.

Add finally the current lore-master's comments that 'the payback for Raxxla would have to be pretty big' and read his face as he says it, and I'm in a mind to conclude either that:

The whole concept of Raxxla has be re-worked to fit into the current narrative - in which case we're unlikely to see it or have any route to it until the whole Thargoid story is done or:
Raxxla is something that they felt they couldn't do justice to and is in the 'too hard to fix' box.
