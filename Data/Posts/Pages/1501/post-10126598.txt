Or it relate to the old method of exploration where Cmdrs scanned dark systems, maybe that would identify something as more and more Cmdrs filled in the gaps?
The "dark systems" are basically any unpopulated anarchy systems with a few extra that are abandoned (or nearly so) for varying reasons. It may be helpful to visualize GalMap as follows: for the sake of simplicity in the past maps would often only show the populated systems (and those previously populated - yes that is a thing). Examples of previously populated are places like Jackson's Lighthouse, Placet, and HIP 15310 (if you haven't been this one is worth a trip - out over on western edges of the Bubble) There are also former mining systems which now sit almost completely abandoned. A great example of these is LHS 449. It currently has a population of 19,160 despite numerous huge stations and is now more a den of piracy. System description of LHS 449:

An obscure Federal mining system that was once known as CPD-46 8664.

The home of Aegean Pirates Inc, which was created by ancient seafaring families of the Old World.
