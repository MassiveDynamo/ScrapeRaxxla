If you want certainty, I am absolutely the wrong person to be speaking to regarding that. Reality is ugly. Humans on the whole don't follow logic and language reflects that. I merely am one ones who figures the ambiguity might actually be useful. Besides, the lore in Elite Dangerous is not the happy go-lucky type where everything is obvious and handed to you on a platter. This is kind of game where if you want treasure, you damn well need to put in the effort.
