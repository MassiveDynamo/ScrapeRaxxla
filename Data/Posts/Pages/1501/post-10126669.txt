So there have been a few references to namelessness lately in ED…

Odyssey - in it Odysseus gives us the original “no man” has hurt me… outis

Both Theta-7 and D-2 had their names taken away from them. Edit- forgot to mention our recent assasin…

What is driving this for me is the codex reference for the dark wheel station:

“The original group was based in a disused starport orbiting the eighth moon of an unnamed gas giant.”

I have essentially been looking for the name of a system that meant “no name” or possibly a system that lost its name?

There is of course Zachariah Nemo - nemo being the latin version of outis.

So far have had little luck - so i decided to share
