The Astrophel could be famous persons related to space/astronomy.
Maybe the path laid out by the systems named after them would form a spiral, or lead somewhere...
I found interesting to discover that Ptolemy (famous for his early cosmogonic model) and Komarov (Russian astronaut) were both neighbors in the same region close to a nebula I visited some time ago.

I tried researching and marking the number of system names to do with Astronomy/Space/etc.... and it's always bugged me the string of stars from Barnard's loop which points directly at the bubble as far as I can see...

Here's some examples you can search on surname (mostly!).... I spent some time just looking at names for star systems in that area and learned a bit about them...the lists below are not exhaustive and these will have been manually named for some reason...??

*there are other astronomers/etc as system names in the bubble too and of course there are loads of stations with famous people's names scattered about too...
