Think Col 70 Sector is locked off; there were rumors about a Wreaken construction site and a dead body in Col 70 Sector, see https://www.edsm.net/en/system/id/2136479/name/Col+70+Sector+PY-Q+d5-16.

The only way I know of to examine the sector is to use the Next button (in Horizons) to if all the systems in Col 70 Sector are permit locked (by a very patient CMDR...)
The reports of Wreaken construction site and a dead body in Col 70 Sector were to match the storyline in Drew Wagar’s second ED book Premonition. While it fitted Drew’s storyline it never seemed to me to fit the game storyline with Col 70 Sector being permit locked. Why would Wreaken build ships in a permit locked area that seemed to be locked because it was Thargoid space?
