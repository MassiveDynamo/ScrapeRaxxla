From the story of @earth-traveller I'm beginning to think that Raxxla might be really close to a star.
If he saw it in the nav panel, a planet/object named Raxxla would only appear if you're close to it.

I doubt that at that time when he saw it was within 1000ls like some POIs might appear now.
For this reason I'm starting to think its around the star, a part of an asteroid cluster and it appeared in the nav panel.

It makes the most sense to me - you jump to a new system, look at the nav panel to see where you are, maybe look at the system map if there is anything interesting etc.
Now I don't know about you but I was flying mostly with "Asteroid cluster" filtered out. If he was not using it this filter, and as he said that he was on his way back to the bubble to turn in his merits, I assume that he must have been just system hopping on the way back.

Hi there... never used system filter... did not even know that was a ting back then... and yep system hopping to get back fast...
