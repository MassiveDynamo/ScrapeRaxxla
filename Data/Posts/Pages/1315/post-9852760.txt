From the story of @earth-traveller I'm beginning to think that Raxxla might be really close to a star.
If he saw it in the nav panel, a planet/object named Raxxla would only appear if you're close to it.
What do you mean ? Actually it is an on-board computer and it names all unknown planets by the star in the system with numbers. I.e. Raxxla in the panel will look like a set of numbers + star.
Do you think that on-board computers have Raxxla with coordinates?
