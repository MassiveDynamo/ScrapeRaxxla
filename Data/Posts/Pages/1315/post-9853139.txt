Think Col 70 Sector is locked off; there were rumors about a Wreaken construction site and a dead body in Col 70 Sector, see https://www.edsm.net/en/system/id/2136479/name/Col+70+Sector+PY-Q+d5-16.

The only way I know of to examine the sector is to use the Next button (in Horizons) to if all the systems in Col 70 Sector are permit locked (by a very patient CMDR...)
That region is humongous. That said I think there are some of the Col 70 sector systems at the very edges that are not locked. The region is exceptionally difficult to plot routes in because arms of dark dust come out from the main nebula. If you haven't been, there is a very interesting star cluster that is nearby (Trapezium cluster - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezium_Cluster ) that is absolutely worth visiting. I believe the battle location between the Thargoids and Guardians was somewhere near the Orion Nebula Tourist Centre in PMD2009 48. I think Canonn's Gnosis had it its infamous hyperdiction somewhere near there. I suspect that may have been a clue as to where to look to get deeper into that region.
