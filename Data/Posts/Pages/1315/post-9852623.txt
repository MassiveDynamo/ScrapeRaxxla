Went to Synuefe GY-O C7-0 other day, fuel stars taking me on a route between synuefe ox-c c15-9 and synuefe en-q c6-1 with a 38.65 jump range. Somewhere between those were three systems in a row that had degraded emission signals, the middle one showing 6. going back there in a bit to search systems surrounding to see if any higher concentrations, and/or try to find sources.
