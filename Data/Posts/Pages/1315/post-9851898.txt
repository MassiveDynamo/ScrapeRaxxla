Interesting, perhaps there is ONE star that lets you into an area that is mostly permit locked… and then a series of unlocked stars within to raxxla at the end. The route plotter would never follow this because it’s a dead end so it would always route around it automatically.

…. furthermore, the story of seeing raxxla by @earth-traveller could be explained by somehow the route plotter accidentally finding a way through under just the right conditions (or a bug) that wouldn’t normally occur
Key. There's the story of Salvation. Who would have found this chain of bases without the first post ?
