DB and MB claim there will be no clues,..snip..
Remember that DW, who doesn't know anything about Raxxla, when writing his novels was told by FD: " Don't touch Thargoids and Raxxla ! (and antigravity) ".
Why would they have told this if Raxxla had no "substance" in ED ?
He added "These are FD reserved"
