A few ideas I have about possible criteria and tests of courage and skill might be the guardian and thargoid sites, all of the different generation ships, surface settlement sites like dav's hope, Crash sites tourist beacons and listening posts. I'm sure there are some things I missed but perhaps a triple elite cmdr having tackled all of those difficult tasks may be closer to getting that tdw invitation.

Remember Raxxla (and presumable TDW) has been in game since gamma. That rules out ANY surface sites, tourist beacons, and probably most of the listening posts.
