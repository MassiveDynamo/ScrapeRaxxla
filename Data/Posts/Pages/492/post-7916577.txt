I’m running into a bit of an anomaly here, with a couple points of interest. Stumbled upon a system called EM* LKHA 361.

The asterisk is usual. It was used when naming Sag a* because the radio signal was “exciting” and atoms in an excited state are denoted with an asterisk. Apparently there are a couple other systems that use the asterisk besides Sag A.

Further, it’s a permit locked system, in a permit locked region by the cone sector, however EDSM is showing 1 ship passing thru in the last 7 days.

Is this suspicious?

Edit: There’s also a giant gap next to it that’s almost entirely void of any stars, in a region where it’s pretty consistently cluttered.
