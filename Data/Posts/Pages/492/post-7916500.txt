DB and MB claim there will be no clues,

folk keep saying this. Its old and said by someone out of the picture now. That might have been right then, but we have the codex now, which is probably as a result of no-one finding it for 4 years or more...

this is becoming tedious - if you don't want to believe in R. then this thread is probably not for you (to quote a previous contribution)

For myself, I've found that following this quest has been a learning experience and has driven me to experience more of the game than I might have. I've had a lot of fun and learnt some stuff, which is cool. I intend to carry on if I can find some threads to pull on.
