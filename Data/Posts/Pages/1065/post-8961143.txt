I really should get my fsd drive engineered. My krait only jumps 50Ly
Im in my multipurpose conda...only just under 40ly, has everything needed for everything and fully grade 5 everything and is a heavy hitter with bi weave and 60% resists on all damage types to sheilds, I used to love the high jump range however you also miss systems not scanned with it, 30+ is golden either way
