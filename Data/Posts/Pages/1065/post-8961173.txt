Ty. Will check out tomorrow.

I'm planning on getting back and selling cartographic to engineer so I would have grade 5 update. Also would need to do some raw material grind.

Once you get into the top 75% and stay there when the cg ends you get the engineered fsd of your grade choice for free also afterwards it will be purchasable and be the best current fsd engineered in the game
