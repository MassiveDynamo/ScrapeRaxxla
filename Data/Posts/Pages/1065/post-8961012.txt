The fact that those systems are vastly unexplored is actually a good sign. If Raxxla is hidden somewhere there, then it isn't surprising that nobody found it in 6/7 years.

And the fact that those systems have been explored with the "old sensors", gives somewhat credibility to the myth that "someone visited the system Raxxla was in, but didn't explore the system".

In other news, I could not get "veil north" working today, perhaps I missed a step I was doing last Thursday. I'll keep trying. This will be probably a long term project, where I got to wait for every Thursday and try again.
