Do you need help with tritium?
I dont want to come back to the bubble just yet due to the amount of non tagged systems im finding, iv just set a commodity order on the fc for 4k tritium at a little over market value, also if anyone finds a triple//double hotspot towards this way and posts it i can gladly also jump it there
