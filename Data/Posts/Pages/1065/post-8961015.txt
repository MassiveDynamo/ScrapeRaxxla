Maths Question:

If we are searching 400bn systems for something that is possibly in 1 of them. Randomly jumping, how many systems on average will we have to search until we find the right system? There must be a probability curve surely. Wild guesses appreciated.

Did you know that if 30 people are in a room its quite probable that someone shares a birthday with you? So it could be a lot less that I think, probably

If there are 30 people in a room call the police! Theyâ€™re breaking Covid restrictions!!
