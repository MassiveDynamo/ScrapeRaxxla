There are in fact 9 planets in game named Gold, and one named Goldstein. From what I have found, Gold is the only planet that has 9 different ones by the same name.
In Van Maanen's star we have a planet named Major. If you put Major into your nav you will be led to Arcturus after Tau Ceti
and in Arcturus you will also find a planet named Discovery. Major, Discovery.
There are 4 planets named Major in the galaxy. Also in Arcturus you will find Richard's Rock, Richard's Mine and Arcas.
Arcus was a hunter who became king of Arcadia.
Also you find the stations, Harrison Fort (Blade Runner's Harrison Ford?) and several other named stations.
I have found 2 strong connections (Or odd easter eggs) in game related to Philip K (another name for Richard), shown above.
I have also found several seemingly important locations with Richards name in it, either as a planet or a station in a seemingly key location..
The system Richard's Gap in the Orion Nebula, the 2 planets Rich and Aust in Synuefe MU-V c16-0,
and Richardson in 70 Ophiuchi (The 13th unofficial constellation of the zodiac) are all suspect.

In LTT 606 you find A planet named Fraser and one named Moel Lefn, a mountain. Also you find a station named Jeremy and one named Journey to Arcadia.
In this blog related to a book we find a Marianne Arcadia from Elydian Dawn and she has a boyfriend named Jeremiah (Jeremy).
"Her inspiring story was something that motivated a young man to undertake a perilous adventure."
"Marianne was conceived either on Earth or maybe in space on the great colony ship Elysian Dawn."

In this system we find a Dark Wheel affiliated name, Neumann, whom has a station on Moel Lefn.
On this planet you will find 2 crashed anaconda's and one of them has a Thargoid Sensor.
