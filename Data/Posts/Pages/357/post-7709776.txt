A planet/Satellite in Sol fits this description.

Hmm, I dunno? Half a million light years from Earth, not seconds and from your link this object was discovered in 2005, which was around four years after the unfortunate death of the author and at least a quarter century after Damogran was submitted for publication in The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.

[Edit: Damogran location and (hot) environment discussed in chapter 4]

Also, as mentioned in the post you quoted it's an "atmospheric (mostly) water world" which would place it significantly closer to it's stellar host. The Heart of Gold was stolen from an outdoor, public launch where none of the main characters required environment suits so 32~44 Kelvin (-241~-229C) is out.

That's also 20 odd years since the original Elite and Raxxla stories.
