Sadly you can’t Supercruise between systems, you just end up at a marker in space that says you’re right there, but aren’t until you actually jump.

That three letter word is an insult in British slang (and with some Americans), but it’s a horrible filter to filter based on partial matching that way...

You can't fly directly into a system. But if you can see it and point to it you can reduce the length to get in range of a system and jump to it normally. Assuming there are no other hinderences. Or at least I'm under the impression you can. I've flown directly to systems and jumped in. Or course I wasn't out of range in the original system either. So, I guess i haven't tested it thoroughly. I've been assuming you can get in range to make a normal jump if you are beyond max range though. I should test that at some point.

I wonder if we can get to ngc 1245 that way. or whatever its called just below the line between those two sectors near heart and soul. I bet it's never been visited. One is even called gen. something. It's probably doable though. Has anyone ventured there? It's supposed to be part of the persei something. I'm assuming it's out of place and maybe in development. Or just out of reach. Maybe it has clues in it.

Wait, can you get to 2001c and turn off flight assist and keep going with the throttle off?!
