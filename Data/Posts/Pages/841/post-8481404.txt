Just a thought, has there been a group of players that just decided to start calling themselves the Dark Wheel? In the codex it says if something like that happened it wouldnâ€™t happen for long but it might force fdev to do something if the group got big enough

I had a moment ago typed out that yes there was one but it only had one player in it and I assumed they had stopped playing because they didn't have any other players. Afterwards I had went to inara to get the link to show you all and unfortunately inara says there is no such Squadron. Take that however you would like

The 2 squadrons exists called "Dark Wheel" and "The Dark Wheel" (and not The Dark Wheel probably because the minor faction exists). "Dark Wheel" is just for fun, nothing serious with 12 members. Afaik anyone can join. "The Dark Wheel" only has 2 members though.
