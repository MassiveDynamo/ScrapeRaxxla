LOL yea id believe that, I know that my first discoveries that ive made, as an xbox user, always take several weeks before they show my CMDR name in the galmap on my console, sometimes say validating forever, i remember my very first set of systems i got first discovery on took over 3 weeks before i saw my CMDR name instead of Validating....

My buddy said it was because there are lots of CMDRs who go out exploring and never return to a station, either they die,stop playing, or even worse, stop playing for months, and return just moments before me with the data. And that the server needs the time to validate I was infact the first person to discover and sell the data at a station, and that an other player, on another server or platform, didnt make it to a station before me, even by a few seconds, and sell the data before me...
