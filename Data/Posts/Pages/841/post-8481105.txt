Has anyone setup or tried to setup an FC as like a starport, like with fuel and repair services?
I was thinking its a cool idea to get residual income from explorers in between Colonia and SOL as well as other places.... But I heard you yourself have to collect the resources that others use? im a bit hazy on the deets....

I wouldn't "need" any. I just passed by 4 starports in nebulas around. I just don't need it any when faster then in 6 months Most likely will be back in bubble 1-2 weeks later.
Damn. Tripple star with 9 earth/water/teras and distances like 300 000ls This will take an hour.
