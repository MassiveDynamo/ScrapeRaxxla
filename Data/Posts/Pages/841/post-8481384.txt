Also a heads up for everyone. I visited surface point in the INRA storyline and it appeared as GEOLOGICAL SIGNAL on the panel before I landed there, I don't remember how it was on screen when I selected it. Just a reminder that Elite Dangerous is not a perfect game and Raxxla or wheel station might be never found because developers never bothered to check if it is not bugged lol

P.S. I remember it now. I knew INRA site was on that body. On the nav panes it only had GEOLOGICAL SIGNALS, but I started eyeballing each one and pointing my crosshair on it in free look mode in cockpit. And yes, there was the site with correct name, it only appeared geo sig on the nav panel, put if you checked each signal on the planes by pointing at it would show correct name
That kind of things genuinely enrage me. We are probably wasting our collective time playing this folly project.
