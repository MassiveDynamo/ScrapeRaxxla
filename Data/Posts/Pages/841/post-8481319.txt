Just a thought, has there been a group of players that just decided to start calling themselves the Dark Wheel? In the codex it says if something like that happened it wouldnâ€™t happen for long but it might force fdev to do something if the group got big enough
I had a moment ago typed out that yes there was one but it only had one player in it and I assumed they had stopped playing because they didn't have any other players. Afterwards I had went to inara to get the link to show you all and unfortunately inara says there is no such Squadron. Take that however you would like
