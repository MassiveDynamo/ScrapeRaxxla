The 2 squadrons exists called "Dark Wheel" and "The Dark Wheel" (and not The Dark Wheel probably because the minor faction exists). "Dark Wheel" is just for fun, nothing serious with 12 members. Afaik anyone can join. "The Dark Wheel" only has 2 members though.

David Braben and Michael Brookes perchance???
