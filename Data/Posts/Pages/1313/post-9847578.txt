Please, allow me to elaborate a little further on what I've been experiencing regarding misterious friend invites received...

- Tripple Elite invitation: received invitation from MADDOGDIVER a few minutes after getting promoted to Elite for the 3rd time in Horizons. I always play in open but this guys never crossed my screen but still his name was present on the "recent contacts" tab. When checked his current location he was like 300ly away because I was in the Pleiades and he was in the bubble... so, no way he'd travel that far that fast;
...
Please, any of you who is willing to walk the extra mile, get allied to the Pilots of Federation, send a friend invite to MATADWE and see what's what... for science!
Invitation sent to MATADWE (Last active 2 days ago) from CMDR Ishap Black (allied to Pilots of Federation).
