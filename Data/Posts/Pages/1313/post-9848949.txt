well then here it is:
Now I'm flying to the Jewel Boxing sector.
A pearl or jewel in the crown of the mother of galaxies, I immediately thought about the jewel box sector, because the jewel is in the box, it makes sense to study that sector.
Having laid the route, I was a little surprised, because the path went through the sector of spiral stars, and this is a damn direct reference to the astrophil! by the way, this sector is poorly studied, but it is close to the bubble... by the way, it is interesting to read about the constellation of the fly and the chameleon and the southern cross (how did the pirates designate the treasure? )
There is also a coal sack there, and what were the Thargoids doing there? The Thargoids circled the bubble and entered the coal sack for a reason, too many coincidences for that direction.
I almost forgot the constellation Siren (siren of the abyss) is located in the southern celestial hemisphere at the site of the modern constellations Fly and Chameleon.
I was searching this area myself last year with a couple of friends, we surveyed about 400 systems in and around the area including asteriod belts
