Well, all other hypotheses seem to have failed!

Mm, not quite true. I currently have one in progress, but physiotherapist confirmed arthritis in thumb base joints. So what with that, and finally trying to redecorate the whole house, my ship is stuck fsd boosted but jump not implemented, for two weeks now. And with the decorating progress Iâ€™m making probably at least another two!

And anyone who thinks decorating with paintbrush & roller with arthritic hands should try it!
