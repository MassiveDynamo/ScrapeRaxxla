ASAP

I won't be able to join as I'm mapping in the Odin's Hold region but have subbed to this thread and will watch with interest. Feel free to contact me, Cmdr Winterwalker in game if anyone has any questions but I don't think my source has very much more to give than what's quoted above since we had quite a long discussion last night. o7 and good hunting.
