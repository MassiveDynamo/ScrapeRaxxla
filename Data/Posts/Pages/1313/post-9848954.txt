Mission Operation Bubble To Barnard's Loop.

Data analysis

Using Spansh to get a destination gives the system Flame Sector DB-X c1-0
SPOILER: CUBEO TO CRAB NEBULA

Using the edsm api gives 750 systems

TODO: Exclude all Non-KGBFOAM? in the 750 systems

Flight log of the CMDR: https://inara.cz/cmdr-flightlog/118999/

Crab Sector DL-Y d9, anyone with a 45ly ship to go to Cubeo and plot a route he passed through Wregoe VI-K b8-0 but the story of a DBX doesnt add up to the flight logs I am also going to share a system he may have passed through that I have been meaning to check out V* V393 Gem
