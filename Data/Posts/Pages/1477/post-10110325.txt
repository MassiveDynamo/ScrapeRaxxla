Spiralling stars?

This just dawned on me, what if the spiralling stars are not actually ‘spiralling’ but just a series of unremarkable systems, but with a shared naming relationship. For example: named after Hills; Rivers; Deities or chocolate biscuits etc.

It would be the naming sequence laid out in Galmap which could form a spiral path (not 2D but in 3 dimensions, going from one point to another / like a tunnel) the ‘Princess’ or Astrophel, could be at the end / start, or maybe thats the naming sequence used eg Star Lovers?

One would only observe said path if one had ‘eyes to see’; able to understand the common relationship between them all.

My rummaging in the Underworld and Yggdrasil has raised my suspicions that FD has placed certain spacial layouts intentionally, naming systems after certain themes, and there maybe paths between them!

Example what if ‘Cora comes home’ does just mean - follow the path of Demeter to Persephone = go down to the Underworld (this path matches the line of sight for systems discovered upto to 2296). Then, the mentioning of ‘lost kingdoms’ in the Codex, literally just relates to the area of lost kingdoms found in that underworld area?

Spiralling Stars, might be another series of systems moving away from this area, but the naming sequence is in a spiral…

As unlikely of course as any other theory…
