'for those with eyes to see'
Currently at the Retina Nebula, a small planetary nebula centred on a Wolf-Rayet star about 3 KLY from the Bubble. Nothing here but an AXI Fleet Carrier.

I'll hang around the surrounding systems for a short while before I head back. This region is a bit off the beaten track and I found an unusual number of undiscovered systems/planets on the way out, given how close to the Bubble this is.

I've been unwell lately and am easing back into it. I have no desire to see the inside of a hospital again! I still have plenty of catching up to do and have forgotten a lot.
