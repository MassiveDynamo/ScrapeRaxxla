“some Roman dignitary moved an Omphalos”? Who was that? First I’ve heard...
Yes - ha don’t quote me on that it’s a vague recollection of some artwork or illustration, some type of procession into a city, the omphalos or Oracle was either being moved or visiting…

Back from the mists of time when I worked in the arts, I’m likely wrong. Again I don’t think it was a truism, more an artwork from the romanticism period. Just tin-foiling.
