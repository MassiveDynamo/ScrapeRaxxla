I was wrong. Delphi in the Pleiades was important. It just was that all parts of the Delphic myth are important - not a singular one.

Had this randomly suggested this morning based on my mythology research and it related to Delphi. I am beginning to think we need to play really close attention to Sol (the original Delphi), Bedaho (Saud Kruger and dolphin connection), Ackwada (Augustus Brenquith is linked to both Ackwada and Saud Kruger), and Delphi in Pleiades where there is a Janus Incorporated. This is J-Corp from First Encounters. It also likely links into Jaques.
