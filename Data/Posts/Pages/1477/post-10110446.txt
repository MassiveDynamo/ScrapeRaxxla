Well, had a quick look at Arcadia. The ancient English puts me off & I can’t see anything obviously relevant, so I still think that “Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars” (if it is indeed a clue and not just more FD fluff/obfuscation) is “for those with eyes to see” an anagram (since we are not given a copy of the aforementioned book text to peruse; we only have that “title”). That is, I suspect the location of Raxxla is given in one of the many variations of letters from that phrase. I’ve posted on this a year or so ago, but I got up to over a hundred valid ED system names from that phrase, at which point I gave up...there is a point at which an interesting puzzle becomes too infuriating and no fun...I think I’m well past that point. Haven’t played for around a month...
