The Omphalos has links to a least 3 myths linked to Delphi, it also pops up in multiple Greek references as: the birth of the titans, Hercules (who had to put on a dress when married to Omphale by order of the Delphi profit), it can be to hub of a wheel, shield, bowl or coin, the brow of a mound, the apex of an island, take your pick!!!!
