But I dont remember hearing about “Arcadia” before...if it’s a childrens’ story then it might be relevant? Must find a copy!
The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia

For context, I’m no expert, but just to rely upon one interpretation restricts our perspective, by no definition do I prescribe my interpretation as the correct course…

Philip wrote it for his little sister as a sort of ‘trifle’ (!) a personal story they developed together at home when she was younger to keep her entertained. It didn’t get published until much later. So a children’s story?

I’ve rambled on several sheets of tin-foil about this before, looking for potential links…again this is just ‘one’ interpretation…this is too wide, so again it might just be the reference to Astrophel is much simpler than we imagine, a system or star port in a particular alignment with other systems - who knows.

It’s equally plausible it means nothing at all and its just poet appropriation.
