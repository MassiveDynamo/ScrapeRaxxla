Spiralling stars?

This just dawned on me, what if the spiralling stars are in fact a series of systems with a shared relationship. E.g. they are all named after Hills; Rivers; Deities or chocolate biscuits etc.

The naming sequence laid out in Galmap, could form a spiral (not necessarily down), the ‘Princess’ (if not an in joke of ‘save the princess’) or Astrophel, could be at the end / start (a name attributed to a Star Lover)….

My rummaging in the Underworld and Yggdrasil does raise my suspicions that maybe such layouts have been placed intentionally.

As unlikely of course as any other theory…

As far as I know spiral stars are just spiral galaxies as they look in the starry sky.
