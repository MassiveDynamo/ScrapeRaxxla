We’re just assuming ’Astrophel’ (Phil) is a reference to Astrophel and Stella. It could likely just mean ‘star lover’.

But we’ve been here before; it’s possible it’s an allusion to something totally different or a red herring or it’s a reference to an in game female character?

Keep digging O7

Female star lover.....thargoid???

But I dont remember hearing about “Arcadia” before...if it’s a childrens’ story then it might be relevant? Must find a copy!
