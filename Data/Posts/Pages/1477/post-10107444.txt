I can’t totally place it, but I recall that some Roman dignitary moved an Omphalos (as there were more than one), there’s a work of art I think depicting it (or the Oracle) being transported?

Just thinking, Braben loves his Roman history. Many people interpret Greek mythology as ‘Greek history’ but the Romans appropriated all of it…so some of it’s rather jumbled up.

There are at least three areas in game where there is an axis; Sol (0,0,0); system Axis Mundi and Delphi.
