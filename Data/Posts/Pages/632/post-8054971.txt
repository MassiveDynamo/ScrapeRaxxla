I do like the idea of organically created regions in space - would have been fun if the bubble had been carved up into regions like you get in parts of a city or country - based on the geography and diaspora from earth or other amalgamations. Maybe an area of dark stars, or closely spaced ones, or different religious groups settled certain areas or ethnic groups, corporations... they picked up on the corporation side - kind of what they are pushing as far as the federation goes ... oh well. I guess im straying into off-topic
