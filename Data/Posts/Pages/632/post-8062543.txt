Is that list up to date ?

That doesn't seem to include the Empire ranks. My list says 26 permits with known solutions including CQC and 1xElite rank. Then there's 22 or more, eg Polaris / Witch's Reach with no apparent unlock.

Take a trip to Alnilam via the Col 69 Sector and you'll learn all about Unknown Permits.
