I've been spending the last couple of weeks close to the Bubble, after another thread ( https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/some-data-how-far-to-go-to-find-a-new-system.521297/ ) suggested that there were still untagged systems close to Sol. I've not quite given up on the Winking Cat idea that the thief is sending us a message saying where to look for them (or something important) but I think I've interpreted it wrong, if it is. So I've been looking to find something close to home, maybe TDW base, maybe a Generation Ship, perhaps a lost INRA outpost, or maybe Raxxla itself.

I'm less than 450LY from Sol and I have indeed been finding untagged bodies, including the occasional 8th moon, mostly distant icy worlds but not always. It's the unscoopable systems that are more likely to have untagged worlds but I've seen a few in systems with an M star primary and it's also worth my mapping unmapped bodies (esp.8th moons) in brighter star systems. I encountered some brain trees in Kappa-1 Volantis and some nearby systems and decided to also look for Ancient Ruins, as this is very close to Sol for Guardians sites.

The fact that there are untagged worlds so close to Sol means that it's quite possible that the types of findings I give above might be out here waiting to be discovered and don't need to be permit locked or blocked off behind weird entry requirements. I plan to keep looking for a little while yet but being close to home means it's easier to get involved with other events if I feel like it.
