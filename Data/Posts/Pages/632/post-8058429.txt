Almost back from a trek out to Alnilam. That's Orion complete, ready for the next II...

Hey bud, can you tell me if 39 Lambda Orionis is permit locked? It's in his head and the coordinates in edsm are showing orange for me and no bodies listed though 5 ships have passed through since 2015. Currently shifting all current data from EDDB to EDSM in my constellation catalogues.

*edit. disregard.
