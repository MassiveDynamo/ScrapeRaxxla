I couldn't do it, I had to abandon the mission, maybe Im not cut out for the Dark Wheel after all.
The trick is to first shoot the thrusters, so they can't run. Since they usually are in combat ships, you'd do well to have feedback cascade rails also. For civilian spaceships, I'd recommend one hardpoint for packhound missiles and the rest just good old fixed multicannons. Fixed weapons have more of a personal feel to them.
