Yes I was saying I morally couldn't kill him because of the chat, I just felt guilty doing it, not physically couldn't catch him or kill him, sorry for the confusion.

Why the preference for feedback cascade over super penetrator on the first post Hannerib? Im new to rails and stayed away from engineering them til I got a bit used to them but have just got 2 with super penetrator thinking that would be the one for when they are fleeing. Nowhere near good enough to really exploit them yet though, still learning to snipe modules. Should I have 1 of each or maybe try 2 feedback as well? usually run MC along with them. On a Cobra Mkiii but have thought about trying them on the FDL too instead of the PCs.

Whats good laser combo as well? Interrupts gameplay to have to go back and refill all the time especially CZ bullet sponges.
