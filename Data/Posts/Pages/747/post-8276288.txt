Just thinking about artefacts and relationships between the known or atleast suspected artefacts that are related to the Dark Wheel and Raxxla.

The Martian Relic is Trinket sized... The SAP-8 core is too big to be the Martian relic, however it does not rule out the relic being a data crystal of some kind.
While I feel some of the Holdstock stories could be the "childrens story" they dont quite fit the name... I am thinking that maybe there is a tourist beacon out there somewhere for the Story of Princess Astrophel and its author ?

Concecaled? Your proofing mechanism had a glitch there buddy!

I, like many people I think, have always interpreted the codex Raxxla image as a station; however seeing the image again in your dit above, and the reference to trinkets and SAP8 caused me a mental hiccup. Could it be one of the Guardian objects end-on? Can’t remember, it’s so long since I did anything Guardian related, but I’m sure one of those has a hexagonal cross section?
