Agreed. Does make me think the DW is a future in game development/DLC waiting to happen though. I lean towards this. However, did anyone see Drew Wagar video where he somehow ran an 'invitation' for the DW to a streamer, cant remember who, think it was linked on this thread? Didn't go anywhere but seemed to me to maybe be a test of the process for future use or missions....and again Drew was allowed to play around with the Dark Wheel story in game......but Raxxla is still off limits, to me meaning its already there, the DW isnt yet.

Just took on one of those 'Assassinate a deserter' missions, first one Ive done. Ive killed Venerable Generals, Politicians and Known Pirates so knew the type. Anyway this guy just kept saying 'Leave me alone I want to live in peace', 'Don't try to follow me I just want to live in peace' and 'I just want to live in peace'.

I couldn't do it, I had to abandon the mission, maybe Im not cut out for the Dark Wheel after all.
