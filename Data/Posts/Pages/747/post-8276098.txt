Could it be perhaps "the jewel on the brow of the mother of galaxies"? Or perhaps 'the jewel on the brow of mother gaia'?

Gaia sometimes referenced as the primordial mother of all life, and is a minor faction in Sol.

Also when I docked at SOL > Daedalus yesterday I noticed the Aegis Core minor faction had a comment that they were just a 'Friend' literally called out with quote marks.

I've ranked up now so it's not showing that anymore, but the sentence caught me as odd after researching all the other comments previously across multiple systems and factions.

So currently investigating them...

Anyone else noticed this?

Not sure... But just realized the galactic sectors are numbered, not just named .... so apparently the Elysian Shore is sector 33
