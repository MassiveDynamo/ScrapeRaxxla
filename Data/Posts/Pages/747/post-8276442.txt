I’ve said it before, but TDW are supposed to be a band of explorers and adventurers. I can’t see assassination missions being at all their style. Might be we have to refuse such missions to gain weight with them! Anybody explored any possible such refusal mechanism?
The first thing Rafe Zetter does is train Alex to kill the guy that killed his dad. That sounds like an assassination mission to me. In fact correct me if I'm wrong but, isn't that the entire plot of the story? and then the story ends happily ever after when he completes that mission.
