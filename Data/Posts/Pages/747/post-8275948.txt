Just thinking about artefacts and relationships between the known or atleast suspected artefacts that are related to the Dark Wheel and Raxxla.

The Martian Relic is Trinket sized... The SAP-8 core is too big to be the Martian relic, however it does not rule out the relic being a data crystal of some kind.
While I feel some of the Holdstock stories could be the "childrens story" they dont quite fit the name... I am thinking that maybe there is a tourist beacon out there somewhere for the Story of Princess Astrophel and its author ?


SPOILER: POTENTIAL RAXXALAN ARTEFACTS
