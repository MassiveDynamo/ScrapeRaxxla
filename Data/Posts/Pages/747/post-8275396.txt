I'm pretty sure it's safe to say blowing up someone's spaceship doesn't kill them, as we should all have learned by now from seeing the rebuy screen. Nothing to feel guilty for. fire at will
Hmm, yes. No doubt about it. Now something I really enjoy is a pair of Imperial Hammers and Pacifiers on a Federal Assault Ship. Lots of options when choosing a target. While I wouldn't recommend Imperial Hammers for utility such as feedback cascade or superpenetrator, they are great at delivering raw damage at distance, in situations such as destroying lightly armoured targets attempting escape. In combat zone scenarios, it is useful to have regular railguns for module sniping, and thus avoiding high hull hardness these ships tend to have. While it might seem merciful to blow up large vessels through powerplant-targeting with over half of their hull integrity intact, the purpose of this strategy is strictly that of convenience, and of saving munitions, and it doesn't necessarily apply for assassination missions.
