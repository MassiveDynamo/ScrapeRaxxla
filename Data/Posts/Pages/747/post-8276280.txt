Good work.

Lyta Crane and the toast are plain DW, so don't expect Raxxla. Look for cold stations at the 8th moons (2F and 6H).

Don’t worry, I’ll fully check the rest of the system when I get back in game, but was half expecting a Raxxla franchise ice cream stall operated by TDW on the surface of 2F, or at least someone hawking lavian brandy. I was disappointed!

Or a beer stand, 27 NS jumps is thirsty work!
