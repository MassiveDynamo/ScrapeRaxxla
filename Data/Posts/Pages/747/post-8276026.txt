Just thinking about artefacts and relationships between the known or atleast suspected artefacts that are related to the Dark Wheel and Raxxla.

The Martian Relic is Trinket sized... The SAP-8 core is too big to be the Martian relic, however it does not rule out the relic being a data crystal of some kind.
While I feel some of the Holdstock stories could be the "childrens story" they dont quite fit the name... I am thinking that maybe there is a tourist beacon out there somewhere for the Story of Princess Astrophel and its author ?

Could it be perhaps "the jewel on the brow of the mother of galaxies"? Or perhaps 'the jewel on the brow of mother gaia'?

Gaia sometimes referenced as the primordial mother of all life, and is a minor faction in Sol.

Also when I docked at SOL > Daedalus yesterday I noticed the Aegis Core minor faction had a comment that they were just a 'Friend' literally called out with quote marks.

I've ranked up now so it's not showing that anymore, but the sentence caught me as odd after researching all the other comments previously across multiple systems and factions.

So currently investigating them...

Anyone else noticed this?
