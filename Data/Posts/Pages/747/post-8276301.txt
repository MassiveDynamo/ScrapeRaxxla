Could it be perhaps "the jewel on the brow of the mother of galaxies"? Or perhaps 'the jewel on the brow of mother gaia'?

At think a lot of things point Sol being the Jewel. One character on Galnet refers Sol as the Jewel. Not to mention if you zoom out on the galaxy map rotate the pizza galaxy around so the Sol can be on the top right or left it could be on just the brow of the galaxy even if you draw a funny little happy face with eyebrows it be pretty close to that position.
