Operation less than 3 comes to mind.

I did 100+ missions for TDW and their allied factions all of a non threatening non-combat nature as per Macro's original operation less than three idea.

Whilst it got me lots of $$ it didn't lead to any seeming difference in mission offerings etc. It is still an interesting path, as the missions are rotating to allies whom I am not yet Allied with, interspersed with the main ones of the period.

I'm having a break from that for a bit, exploring, engineering, and investigating other options. Will get back to it later to see if there is any major changes over time.
