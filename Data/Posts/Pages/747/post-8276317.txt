I’ve said it before, but TDW are supposed to be a band of explorers and adventurers. I can’t see assassination missions being at all their style. Might be we have to refuse such missions to gain weight with them! Anybody explored any possible such refusal mechanism?

Operation less than 3 comes to mind.
