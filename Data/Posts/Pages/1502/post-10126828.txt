Technically, Frontier and First Encounters occur in parallel but they tell the story from differing perspectives often there was Imperial take and a Federal take on events. Sometimes even First Encounters had multiple names for the same place either in the same entry or across multiple entries.
Actually i think the Olitqu vs Gateway show the time gap. Frontier happens just before the creation of the Alliance 3200 ish and First Encounters - just after - about 3250. Of course those are dates from fe2 and ffeâ€¦. Havent checked to see how it fits in ED timeline

I enjoyed the Brenquist bit about Quphieth -had missed that.
