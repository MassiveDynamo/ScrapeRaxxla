And access to the Dark Wheel faction at the start of the game?
But TDW faction in Shinrarta apparently leads nowhere. The old (deleted) E/F missions might have been a valid reason to be elite to find Raxxla, but since their deletion with no apparent replacement Shinrarta seems to be a dead end for the quest. So that alleged DB quote, if valid, might have been retconned with that deletion. The E/F. missions might have been part of a Raxxla storyline, but I suspect it changed from a storyline based in-game quest to an easter egg to be found from the clues-codex, TB, galnet and novels.

SPOILER: NOVEL THOUGHTS
