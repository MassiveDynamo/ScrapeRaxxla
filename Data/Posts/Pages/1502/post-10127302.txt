I agree. I think the alleged DB quote (there is no corroborative evidence) may have been about something else or is out of date. We don't have a date for it but it seems to be from the very early livestreams (2014-15?) and disagrees with what MB said about Raxxla (see my earlier summary of everything we know - @Macros Black did you add that summary onto the OP compadre?).

The only reason for requiring Elite would be the Shinrarta permit, and that system has been thoroughly searched. I’m also suspicious about the alleged requirement for a wing...it might help, depending on what Raxxla/Omphalos actually is and how we might recognise/ locate it, but that statement also seems to disagree with MB’s statements.
If you can give an approximate version of this quote, we might be able to source it or get info to effect it was a rumor.
