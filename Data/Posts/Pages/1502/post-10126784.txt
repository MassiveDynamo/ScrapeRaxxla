I don't expect people to believe the same way I do (nor do I want that). I do, however, want you to think. Part of what makes the Elite Universe's lore so amazing is it is so very human. It isn't perfect. Things rapidly changed. It has perspectives from multiple cultures. People age. It features the imperfections of human memory. It features things that are well known and those that are but rumors (both old and new).
