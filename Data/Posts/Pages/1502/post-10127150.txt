But TDW faction in Shinrarta apparently leads nowhere. The old (deleted) E/F missions might have been a valid reason to be elite to find Raxxla, but since their deletion with no apparent replacement Shinrarta seems to be a dead end for the quest.
I'm not sure it's a dead end. It may just have run it's course for now. Considering the slow pace of story development in ED, it could well be sleeping for a few years.

As I said before, I think they were supposed to foreshadow and help find Guardian ruins. If so, it links them to the Halseys vissions of the caretakers and to Gan Romero. These little story elements at least when put together, gives me a bit of Raxxla vibe.

We have found a lot of information on the Guardians, but we only have half the story. We have no idea where the exiled Guardians with AI implants went and what happened to them. Finding this may be the next step. The Dark Wheel could wake up again, when there is a need for new discoveries.

I doubt FD will implement the next step in the Guardian story while the Thargoid war is in ful force. Hopefully it cools down a bit.
