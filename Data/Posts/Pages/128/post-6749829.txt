Out of curiosity, can he see if people are watching who aren't signed into youtube/google? I'm watching but I can't tell if I'm one of the 3 watching or if he possible has a bunch of invisos watching outside of a signed in environment. And did he get to dryu yet or did I miss it. I wanted to see it. Even if there is nothing there. 8)

Nope, he hasn't got there yet. Although he's still going to go for the heck of it. 8)
