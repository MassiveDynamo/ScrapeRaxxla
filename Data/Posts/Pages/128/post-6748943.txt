Just had a realization. The Elite Federation of Pilots = The Dark Wheel. It all makes since now! Circle Of Independent Elite Pilots were capable of manipulating the Major superpowers of humanity from Soontill. Which wasn't that far from the Bubble, and they were just a Breakaway faction from the Dark Wheel proper. The Dark Wheel was obsessed with finding Raxxla (according to 'And here the Wheel"), and considered the search for Soontill to be an unnecessary distraction. Oberon Ryder split from the main group and those under him pursued Soontill instead. Soontill was/is pretty close to the bubble and they were able to influence the bubble's politics extremely well. The Dark Wheel never found Raxxla, but in 3290 the current FSD drives were released to the public. The Club were able to push the Technology into the hands of Sirus Corp, preventing bubble wide political instability.
To make a long strain of details short: The Pilots Federation have access to every CMDR's ship's data logs at once. The Antares Search CG awhile back was test to see if CMDR's could locate something long lost with no evidence to its current location, and it was a success. Theres lot more to this theory, but im to lazy to write it all down now.
However i don't believe Founder's World is Raxxla. its just a world the Pilots Federation likes to keep tight lipped about. The Dark Wheel faction is a front, and not the real deal. Thats what the DW Missions were ultimately about: finding out what is going on with that Faction. But there wasn't much to learn as the faction doesn't get to do much of the important, upper echelon deals that the Elites engage in. Their actions are more subtle. I don't thing the Club and The Elites are the same though..
