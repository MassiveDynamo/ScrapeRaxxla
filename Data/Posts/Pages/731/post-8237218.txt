Theres a few system descriptions like that with 'mysterious' things going on, does make wonder, some of them may 'point' towards or be near a certain system and all refer to that...just a hint that maybe you're in the right region of space. I do think it may be 'a tiny bit obvious' as well

Some seem to point towards Unauthorised Installations, some of which to all intents and purposes act as Pirate Bases in the old games, some don't, I helped defend one today (brilliantly called Damnation Centre...I've been to Hell and back looking for Raxxla ) but no extra reward as such.
