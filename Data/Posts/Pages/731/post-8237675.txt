Pretty sure tht syatems not showing on Galmap are a bug mentioned to be fixed in Jan update, maybe wrong but too lazy to check on listed bug fixes.

From the Update Thread, First one is pretty general so could be included in that.:

Fixed an issue that prevented the search function on the Galaxy Map from working correctly.
Localisation/Text

Fixed incorrect system description for 'Alioth'.
Fixed a small typo in the description of "HR 7221 Wheat"
