There's no system of that name in the game, at least when entered into the Galaxy Map search function. His ship was called that though? Which system do you mean?

Oops, wrong reference obviously. From memory...Euraxia? Whatever it is means good with words, opposite of Dyslexia. Don't think I have it bookmarked either, its on DW blog or Twitter feed for sure, that's where I read it. Someone must know? Pretty sure its Eur and theres an X in there.
