I hunted many new Wolf Rayet, Herbig and another rare stars in "AA-A Hx" systems. I visit distant sectors and then search these systems with increasing number "x". What is interesting for you is that sometimes I don't find star but the same as you - just pointer to nowhere. There is sometimes "regional" name when I zoom star map out but sometimes not and this looks as this case. HD 144218 and Graffias is Scorpius constellation so probably just another known name. Some small nebulaes (but not stellar remnant) have the central area without any star on star map. I tried find some hidden stars in nebulaes this way (visually and looking to navigation panel) but never found anything. Of course it is still interesting we can find such places using galaxy map search feature.
