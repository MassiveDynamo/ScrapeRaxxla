Cassiopeia: The Banished Queen Ruling the Night Sky
Cassiopeia is one of the most familiar constellations in the night sky, and she hosts a range of interesting star clusters — as well as a legend of arrogance, jealousy and enraged gods.

Those with a telescope and a bit of astronomy know-how can find Cassiopeia's deep-sky objects at:

M52 – RA23h 24.2m D+61° 35′

NGC 457 – RA01h 19m 32.6s D+58° 17′ 27″

NGC 7789 – RA23h 57m 24s D+56° 42.5′

Is RA possibly part of what Raxxla is? I assume this is part of a coordinate system. Does anyone know what it is? Maybe XXLA is part of the games designations while RA is from this system. Right Ascension?! Part of the sky from a certain point. I'll assume england or something. Now sure where that is usually referenced from.

Does the story have anything to do with peter pan? I'm assuming the lovers woah has to do with the story of the queen and here daughter somehow. I'm assuming the 6 references make a 3d coordiante system indicating where something is. There is a star in cassiopeia's head to start with. I'll assume it involve her and her hustand and her daughter as one set. and maybe another set of 3 dots with other elemnts in the story. The owl maybe? It was part of the perseus story. I think he rescues her.
