Right Ascension and Declination are astronomical coordinates for the night sky, used all over the world. Their reference points are above/below the ecliptic, basically an "equator" (a great circle on the celestial sphere representing the sun's apparent path during the year, so called because lunar and solar eclipses can only occur when the moon crosses it) for declination, and Right Ascension is counted in minutes and hours around the ecliptic from the First Point of Aries, the location of the vernal equinox. As it's the real-life common astronomical coordinate system used for describing positions of stars, constellation etc from Earth it's unlikely to have anything to do with Raxxla.
What if it's something like RA 24 24 12 1? Where would that be? Maybe Raxxla tells us the RA coordinate for something.

Right ascension - Wikipedia
en.wikipedia.org

Any units of angular measure could have been chosen for right ascension, but it is customarily measured in hours (h), minutes (m), and seconds (s), with 24h being equivalent to a full circle.

RA 24 degrees 24 hours 12 minutes 1 second!?
Does the full circle remind anyone of past ideas on Raxxla?
