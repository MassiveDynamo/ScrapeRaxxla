I see this has been going for years. Seems to be very in depth. Where is this thread at as far as the main hypothesis now?

What “main hypothesis”??
The only one I know of is “Raxxla exists, it’s in-game, in the Milky Way and FD know where it is (& maybe why nobody has found it)”

Tinfoil time:
The codex entry states that "several versions of the story mention an alien artefact, the Omphalos Rift". An alien artefact was found on Mars. Zeus placed the Omphalos Stone at Delphi to mark “the middle of the world”. Zeus lived on Mount Olympus. There is an Olympus Village on Mars. The Omphalos Stone supposedly allowed communication with the gods.

Hypothesis- the alien artefact found on Mars was a Guardian device providing communication with the Guardian network. This has been kept secret within, and reserved to, the highest levels of the Federation elite, and likely would have influenced Jasmina Halsey’s visions.
