I think it is the error in the interpretation of the astronomical data by the game engine. Beta 2 Scorpii is the triple star system - Graffiias + B (https://eddb.io/body/16390446) and + that HD 144218 (double star) that rotating around the A+B at 2,2 ly distance

P.S. I'm sorry. In real life Graffias itself is the double star also. And overall it is six stars in the system.
