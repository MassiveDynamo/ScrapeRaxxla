What else is interesting is this reacts to at least two system listed as alternative names for the star. Does anyone know if that location is where it should be? It's very near graffias.

The black dwarf thing is interesting. This could hypothetically confirm this. I wonder if it's a missing star that is turned off. Should this star be dim enough for this?! I think I agree this should be bug reported for an answer. I'm lazy. Anyone up to it.

Yes, a lot of the stuff about the raxxla symbol seems to clearly relate to certain base potentially. We went over a bunch of specifics and found some interesting correlations at one point. I can't remember what they all were though.

There are a lot of oddities like the 3 partial circle bar things around the dot is the same as certain UI elements. But it's upside down. That is a common theme. Stuff is upside down.

The 2d representation has multiple 3d/4d representations. One is a tesseract. I think someone pointed out that tesseracts and other things have to do with 3d coordinates also or something similar to that.
