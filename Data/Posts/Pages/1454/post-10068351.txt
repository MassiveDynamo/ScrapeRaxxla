Hi Jorki,

Think I've also said I take much of what DB said before launch with a pinch of salt as it was a pitch/marketing process to gain more sales/players....

I was just looking at the info back when the game was being developed and how fluid the design/build phases were right up to launch rather than a meticulously planned game and full narrative/lore.... or that's how it felt to me from being involved in the testing and feedback.

In terms of the beta references and honking ("if the reference to honking and leaving being in Beta 2.1 was true"), I was referring to others I've seen over the years that referenced the beta....
