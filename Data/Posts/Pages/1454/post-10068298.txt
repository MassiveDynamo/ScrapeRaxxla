@Emperor Mmm, think you’re conflating two different things there!
DB did indeed say Raxxla was in-game during the beta period, though I think the gamma would also have been under development at that time. So we cant know which version.

So Raxxla is either in beta or gamma versions of the universe. I think the gamma is pretty well everything we have now?

The report that MB said the Raxxla system had been honked but Raxxla was not discovered was probably from the 2017 Lavecon (I checked with Ascorbius)- time enough for pilots to fly to the edge of the universe!!

So, as Ive said before, that reported MB saying is interesting but entirely unhelpful in narrowing down the location of Raxxla.

Edit: you could hypothesise that it is likely, from the first rumour date, to be near Sol so in in the beta bubble...however I’ve also pointed out that a rumour does not need it to have been physically visited. Could have been observed as an anomaly in telescopic observations out to the edge of the galaxy (& beyond).

I’d still say, from a metagaming/design/chortling DB viewpoint that it is likely to be in or very close to the early bubble. But the fact that we dont know what it is, or how to recognise it, or if its near the ecliptic/out in the realms of deep space within its system means we are still severely hampered!
