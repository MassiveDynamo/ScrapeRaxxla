I am still hoping we can eventually get Drew Wager back to being an active participant in the community. If we can dig up something on the Oisir/Klaxxian divide he might hop back in. Also, thanks for posting this information. Apparently, will have a good deal of weekend reading to do
I think Drew has well removed and distanced himself from anything ED related. And considering some of the inclinations from those with actual involvement I doubt Drew knew much of anything except pre 2016 lore.
