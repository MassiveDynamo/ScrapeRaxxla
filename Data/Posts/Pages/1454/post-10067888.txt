Yes a lot was revised, I don’t wish to speculate on the whys and how’s too much as it’s most likely was FD reacting to the market and resources, yes a sad loss, but we are here now - but my initial thought was, how much did those early concepts influence how things actually transpired (maybe they didn’t) early on I do presume things were much simpler, if anything of those old bones exist, do they help at all with fleshing out where certain things might be? Just idle speculation.
