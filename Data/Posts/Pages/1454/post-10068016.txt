Have you been back to the Kickstarter page... Quite a few Dev diaries on there which whilst I haven't watched them in years will probably show what changed after the initial pitch... There was some sort of Dev forum for early contributions/discussions but for the life of me I can't remember what they were called to see if I can find them again... As I remember it they had high level plans and promises (like off line mode) and as they worked through them some worked, some didn't and some just got binned... How space travel would work was definitely one of the things that changed during that process (I mentioned super cruise before but I also seem to remember nav beacons and how you enter systems also changing back then too)... It was all a bit fluid back before launch is I guess is what I am saying and so I personally find it hard to put any significance on anything pre-launch from DB...
Have you got a link to that kickstarter page?
I have found mention of several FD vids which seem to have disappeared; might be a good idea to check that page.
