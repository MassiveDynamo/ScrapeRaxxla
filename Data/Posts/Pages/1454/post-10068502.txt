Can you solve this puzzle "Place that isn't a place, door that is also the key what am I?"

Here are a few ways to interpret the puzzle you provided:
"Place that isn't a place, door that is also the key": A keyhole is a small opening in a door that allows a key to be inserted to unlock the door. It is a place that isn't a place because it is a small hole or opening and it is also a door because it allows access to the locked space.

The liminal deities are those often reinforced through place names, ship names, etc. It may be worthy of considering what we seek isn't in a single system but either spread out amongst many systems or something related to traveling between spaces. Faraway is after all, mentioned directly in GalNet.
