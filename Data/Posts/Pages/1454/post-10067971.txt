Yes a lot was revised, I don’t wish to speculate on the whys and how’s too much as it’s most likely was FD reacting to the market and resources, yes a sad loss, but we are here now - but my initial thought was, how much did those early concepts influence how things actually transpired (maybe they didn’t) early on I do presume things were much simpler, if anything of those old bones exist, do they help at all with fleshing out where certain things might be? Just idle speculation.
Have you been back to the Kickstarter page... Quite a few Dev diaries on there which whilst I haven't watched them in years will probably show what changed after the initial pitch... There was some sort of Dev forum for early contributions/discussions but for the life of me I can't remember what they were called to see if I can find them again... As I remember it they had high level plans and promises (like off line mode) and as they worked through them some worked, some didn't and some just got binned... How space travel would work was definitely one of the things that changed during that process (I mentioned super cruise before but I also seem to remember nav beacons and how you enter systems also changing back then too)... It was all a bit fluid back before launch is I guess is what I am saying and so I personally find it hard to put any significance on anything pre-launch from DB...
