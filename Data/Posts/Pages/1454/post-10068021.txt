Have you got a link to that kickstarter page?
I have found mention of several FD vids which seem to have disappeared; might be a good idea to check that page.
Elite: Dangerous
Take a ship and 100 credits to make money legally or illegally - trade, bounty-hunt, pirate, assassinate your way across the galaxy.
www.kickstarter.com

Truthfully, we may ought to archive in some fashion the FAQ and any update posts. I think the official YouTube channel hosts any videos from Kickstarter era.
