Do we have a master list of systems with eight moons orbiting gas giants? I have one to cross off - Flyeia Dryoae BM-K d9-34 B 3 H - nothing apparent from scans and flying in orbit.
I have it at home, but you won't like it. It includes only systems that are less than 1,000 531 Ly from Sol and it's 10 pages long I think.

Edit: Found it. 5,031 bodies, not filtered by gas giants, sorted by distance from Sol. The list is courtesy of CMDR Fartlily, here's the original thread on Reddit.
