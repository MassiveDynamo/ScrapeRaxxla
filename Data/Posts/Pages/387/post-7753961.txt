I can commend this thread:

https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threa...the-the-dark-wheel-which-system-is-it.477422/

here it has been narrowed down to being a giant or supergiant star based on the dimensions which reduces the list considerably.
Why the OP assumes that it's a real in-game screenshot of the TDW's station is beyond me...
