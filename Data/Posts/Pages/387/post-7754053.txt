Alright fellow tinfoilers, I hope that your hats are freshly folded with enough layers and that they have no holes, because I have a theory that is mine and it belongs to me, and it's about the first part of the TDW's toast:
"To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies!"

I believe that the Egyptian lead isn't properly followed and explored. If we go back to the very first mention of Raxxla in The Alien World - the Complete Illustrate Guide by Steven Eisler, we can read that Raxxlans founded Egypt. Of course that book isn't considered canon, but I find it hard to believe that DB switched from Egyptian to Greek context in this riddle, regarding the usual interpretation that the mother of galaxies is Cassiopeia.

Therefore I turned to the Egyptian interpretation and found some convincing results - in Egyptian mythology there are two sky goddesses: Hathor and Nut and I'd say that both are two manifestations of the same deity. One of Hathor's titles is Lady of Heaven (Nebt Nut).

Sometimes she is represented as a holy cow whose milk (Greek: galaxias - milky) created our galaxy, and sometimes she's represented as the Milky Way itself:


Interpreted like that, our brow should be somewhere in or around the Gemini constellation.
