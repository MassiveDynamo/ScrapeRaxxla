It's not discredited if Princess Astrohphel and Spiraling Stars contains concealed facts about Raxxla's location. Some tried to discredit it, because "these details [...] bear a striking resemblance to the children's story".

Edit: It's not a virtual, but parallel universe.

At this point I am borderline on both ideas cause at this point it hasn't necessarily help us to find anything new. (Astrophil and Stella). It is possible because we are misinterpreting the sonnets or clearly we are not seeing what FD seeing. Due to the fact there is so many Sonnets so many words to actually go through and try to piece everything together that could relate to Raxxla itself. It's very time consuming.

And the other reason which results me to be in between the idea of codex Princess Astrohphel and Spiraling Stars isn't exactly the same title of the actual book Astrophel and Stella. There are added words and meaning to the title on the codex has a different representation to the actual book. And naturally I doubt you can call Astrophel and Stella a children story.

Penelope Devereux which was supposedly the inspiration to the actual book wasn't a Princess she was a Countess. The actual book only mentions Princess ( or this case how Philip Sidney spells it Princesse) 3 times through the entire book.

I'm referencing this out of this book.

The codex wants to portray there character as a Princess in Elite lore the only faction that uses such titles is Empire by close resemblance and coincidentally Empire was modeled after ancient Rome.

Aisling Duval is the only person in Elite that is called Princess even considering how much controversy she has against her even as a child.

Spiraling Stars could represent the people around her, or her lineage as they all had interesting views of the Empire that "Spiral" in certain directions.
