Because you got to have some starting point and if you have better suggestion, feel free to share. Besides, it certainly does look like in-game screenshot.
Assuming that you're in working force I'll ask you a question: did your company pay a photographer that took actual photos, or did they put some stock photos on the website?
I assume that only a few people in FDev know the exact locations of Raxxla and the TDW's station and a designer that made that screenshot is certainly not one of them.
I'll share my suggestion in another post.
