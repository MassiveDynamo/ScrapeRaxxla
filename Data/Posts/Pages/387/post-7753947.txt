Do we have a master list of systems with eight moons orbiting gas giants? I have one to cross off - Flyeia Dryoae BM-K d9-34 B 3 H - nothing apparent from scans and flying in orbit.

I can commend this thread:

here it has been narrowed down to being a giant or supergiant star based on the dimensions which reduces the list considerably.
