Alright fellow tinfoilers, I hope that your hats are freshly folded with enough layers and that they have no holes, because I have a theory that is mine and it belongs to me, and it's about the first part of the TDW's toast:
"To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies!"

I believe that the Egyptian lead isn't properly followed and explored. If we go back to the very first mention of Raxxla in The Alien World - the Complete Illustrate Guide by Steven Eisler, we can read that Raxxlans founded Egypt. Of course that book isn't considered canon, but I find it hard to believe that DB switched from Egyptian to Greek context in this riddle, regarding the usual interpretation that the mother of galaxies is Cassiopeia.

Therefore I turned to the Egyptian interpretation and found some convincing results - in Egyptian mythology there are two sky goddesses: Hathor and Nut and I'd say that both are two manifestations of the same deity. One of Hathor's titles is Lady of Heaven (Nebt Nut).

Sometimes she is represented as a holy cow whose milk (Greek: galaxias - milky) created our galaxy, and sometimes she's represented as the Milky Way itself:


Interpreted like that, our brow should be somewhere in or around the Gemini constellation.

I made a post about this, a while back. Can't find it now, because neither forum search nor Google advanced can find old posts in the new forum.

Anyway, the essence was that Castor is Alpha Gemini. Short form is aGem. A Gem is close to a jewel.

Didn't find anything in Castor though.
