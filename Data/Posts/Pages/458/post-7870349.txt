Ok, so Astrophel is a synonym of astrofell, which is from the Greek Aster. In Sol's main belt, there should be 1218 Aster. This is interesting as Sol is the home of humanity. Home is a place that is also a place.

In ED, we also have Aster in Ross 154, which is missing its rings.

We also have Aster Trees, which have only ever been discovered in Cliewoae sector, which is in the Abyss - The darkest void...
