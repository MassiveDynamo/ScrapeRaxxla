I'm afraid I have trouble the the whole Astrophil sonnets connection - Astrophil (not Astrophel) is not a princess, but is in fact a bloke, and its not by any stretch of the imagination a 'children's story' and sprialling stars do not feature. Is this not just one of those unhappy google coincidences?
Honestly? We just don't know. I'm not sure if there is a connection either ... this just popped into my Google news feed (based on past searches, I'm sure) and I thought I'd share.
