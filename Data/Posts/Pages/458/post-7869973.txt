I'm afraid I have trouble the the whole Astrophil sonnets connection - Astrophil (not Astrophel) is not a princess, but is in fact a bloke, and its not by any stretch of the imagination a 'children's story' and sprialling stars do not feature. Is this not just one of those unhappy google coincidences?
