Funny you should say that. I was asking about localisation last night because I was planning to run the sonnets through a cypher

German localization: "Fernweh"; "Prinzessin Astrophel und die Spiralsterne"

The part "Spiralsterne" is hard to interpret and even harder to tranlsate. Whereas I understand the english version "spiralling stars" as stars that actually are moving in a spiral, the German localization is to be understood more like "stars that are a spiral" or rather part of a spiral. Hope this is helpful.
