I'm afraid I have trouble the the whole Astrophil sonnets connection - Astrophil (not Astrophel) is not a princess, but is in fact a bloke, and its not by any stretch of the imagination a 'children's story' and sprialling stars do not feature. Is this not just one of those unhappy google coincidences?

Despite being about tournaments and unrequited love, and having nothing to do with stars, planets or mysteries, it's DEFINITELY a clue!

Combine the whole thing with 'fernweh' and you'll get the full Dark Wheel orientation pack.
