Ok, something weird happened to me, and im pursuing a lead...
instead of writing it all down again i leave u the link to my running post about my trips around the galaxy:

Sumarizing, i ran into a tip about a ship, and when i got there, it gave me random fragments that leads me to believe they were talking about raxxla.
So a im atm heading to what i hope is true and ill revendevous with a ship in SAGI A, and hopefully that will lead me to another tip... Or a dead end... Lets see...

This all came from doing a job for the dark wheel in Jameson, in this case taking a passenger...

Havent been this excited about a game event since february when i went on my 1st real exploration trip out.
