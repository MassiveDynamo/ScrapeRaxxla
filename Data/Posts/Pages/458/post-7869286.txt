I think it dates back to Elite or Frontier:Elite 2, when those solicitors dealt with our Grandfather's will.....so it's from the mind of DB I suspect. Great name!

There's a solicitors in Leamington Spa named...

Wright Hassall

Lolled when I saw that one.

WRT Sue, Cripple & Sneer - I wonder if Sneer's first name is Cyril? The Racoons was an awesome kids cartoon from the 80s...
