As someone suggested a page earlier it might be helpful to get allied status with Eurybia Blue Mafia I flew out there last night to do just that. A thorough scan of Eurybia will also happen. Will report back.

@PeteACarter : Can jump back to Sol, when Eurybia is finished and scan Mars.

Concerning Sue, Cripple & Sneer Solicitors: WHoever came up with that name doesn't seem to be overly enthusiastic when it comes to lawyers or maybe it was a Morrissey fan with "Sorrow will come in the end" on Permaloop - who knows.

Getting cordial/friendly with Eurybia Blue Mafia is the requirement to get access to Liz Ryder, so lots of people have done it (me included), so if this were to be a lead then I think you’d have to go beyond that. Allied might do it but I’m a suspicious soul. “Chris & Sylvia's Paradise Hideout” there has always seemed a bit strangely named; might be a backer-named item, or might be something else? Maybe you need to do some Tip Off missions there???
