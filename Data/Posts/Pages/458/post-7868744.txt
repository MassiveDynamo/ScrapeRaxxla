Getting cordial/friendly with Eurybia Blue Mafia is the requirement to get access to Liz Ryder, so lots of people have done it (me included), so if this were to be a lead then I think you’d have to go beyond that. Allied might do it but I’m a suspicious soul. “Chris & Sylvia's Paradise Hideout” there has always seemed a bit strangely named; might be a backer-named item, or might be something else? Maybe you need to do some Tip Off missions there???

Still not a patch on "Glenn's House of Lambada"
