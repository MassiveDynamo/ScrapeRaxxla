I'm really keen for others do do the specific tip-off missions in pareco - to steal the data from Blackman Silo and see if they get the same on-screen message. I'm sort of assuming i don't get it any more because i've already been granted the status; but it also could have been removed from legacy, so really would prefer to get that clarified.

lol. i'm pretty sure i'm remembering and reporting accurately on this occasion. But we won't have evidence til someone else does it.
I think I'm gonna spend some time in Pareco this week, however I'm not elite in anything yet.
Do you remember which faction issued that data-stealing mission? I wonder if it's just that faction that needs to be allied as opposed to all of them.
