is the only strange bit. You say it happened after you did a Tip-Off mission, and this repeated three times - it sounds like maybe it was a bug, it's certainly unusual - but if you've been trying to repeat the same steps and not seen it for 2 years, then that does suggest it was a bug that's been patched, at least. It doesn't sound like anything I've ever seen in-game at all, or heard anyone talk about anything like this, so that's why I'm sceptical it was purposeful.
I'm really keen for others do do the specific tip-off missions in pareco - to steal the data from Blackman Silo and see if they get the same on-screen message. I'm sort of assuming i don't get it any more because i've already been granted the status; but it also could have been removed from legacy, so really would prefer to get that clarified.
... and I'm wondering if it's possible that you maybe mis-remembered it or mis interpreted it, like you did with your previous report (from about 2 years ago) of a symbol that looked like the Raxxla logo appearing in your nav panel? Since this happened around that same sort of time...
lol. i'm pretty sure i'm remembering and reporting accurately on this occasion. But we won't have evidence til someone else does it.
