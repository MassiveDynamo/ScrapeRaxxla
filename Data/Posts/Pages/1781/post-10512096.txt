I think there are (at least) four kinds of missions that arrive via comms.
First (1) is "common", like Aegis or Salvation or some such giving the same mission to many commanders, e.g. community goals.
Second are (2) "combat" missions that appear via comms when you enter a combat zone.
Third (3) type I would just call "comms".
Fourth (4) is "tip-off" by mysterious stranger.

So we've got (1) common, (2) combat, (3) comms and (4) tips and I have rarely seen anybody writing about the (3) comms type.

Comms missions are given by some representative of some local minor faction.
They are offering a mission via comms that you can accept or decline.
The Johnson of that mission is no Johnson or Mysterious Stranger.
It is a person with an actual name and faction that you could probably find if you would look at the mission boards at nearby stations.
The mission targets are close by, probably within the usual range of missions and I haven't got a covert scanning mission yet.

Sometimes comms missions seem to be chained. You do one mission, then later the same guy gives you another mission while referring to the first one. It may form some kind of quest line.
Usually these missions very quickly evolve into murder hobo style, for example "blow up 13 passenger ships" - and I am not particularly inclined to do these.
No, not even for, eh, scientific purposes, e.g. to find out if this is the main quest of the game to prove yourself worthy of becoming a murder hobo in some elite club of murder hobos.

Most simple rule for appearance: Comms missions appear if you do a lot in a system or region. I recently got two at once when I gathered powerplay merits.
They also seem to appear more often when you stay in an instance for an extended period of time, like 1 or 2 hours. I usually received them when I was mining or looking at stars and triangulating directions or some such.
