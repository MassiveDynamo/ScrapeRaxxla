Good point however, contextually the current chained missions came about much later
Yes - I wasn't thinking in terms of the formal "chained missions" - instead, the effect on your location of:

- stay in that destination system until you get another tip-off mission (get sent to the other side of the bubble)
- over there, do it again (...)
