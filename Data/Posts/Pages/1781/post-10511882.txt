Do you remember which faction issued that data-stealing mission? I wonder if it's just that faction that needs to be allied as opposed to all of them.
Tip-off missions aren't issued by factions as such - just as a potential consequence of completing a mission while allied with any faction. It shouldn't matter if that's the route to it which faction you're allied with (though obviously, the more you're allied with, the more missions to "do while allied" you can pick from)
