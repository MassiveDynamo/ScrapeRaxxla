Just a thought, but if the "elite" message you got (you said you're Master in Combat but what are your trade & exploration ranks?) was TDW recognition perhaps youve got to do more missions for them? The screenshot you posted from the comet (have you managed to get that to reappear for yourself?) said comet Faction ownership was New Pareco Green Party.... it's possible that might changewith time or for each player happening on the comet.
I'm double or triple elite in trade and exploration, just never found the combat very interesting. It is possible that there are more covert missions to do, its just worrying that I've heard literally nothing since legacy was hived off from live/odyssey two years ago. Prior to that, i got the "elite" mission 3 times. Since then, nothing. I tried asking FDEV if raxxla was still in legacy but they absolutely refused to discuss it.

I also spent an hour last night trying to honk repeatedly in the vicinity of the comet both in supercruise and normal space - with no result whatsoever.

someone asked - i've never successfully landed in the comet instance, even though i know some people have been able to do it almost at will. I've really no idea what i'm doing wrong and i would really, really appreciate someone able to wing up in legacy and help me into the instance.

I would also mention that i've a family and a job and i'm doing this in random 5 spare minute segments so apologies if it take me a while to pick things up or i miss something
