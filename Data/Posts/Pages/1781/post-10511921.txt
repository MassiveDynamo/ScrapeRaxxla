There is a possible explanation here that I don't want to rule out just yet... some later work by djadjok established a few extra rules on Tip-off sites: specifically, you get the furthest active one in the bubble you're currently in that you haven't seen recently. (i.e. my point 4 in that old post was largely wrong)

So the clue sequence works like this:
- Pareco is weird (six stations in a ring, aligned to Polaris [1]) - I agree that some of the arguments to line the names up with the Dark Wheel toast are tenuous, but the whole "ring of stations around a dark object" can do for a subtle Dark Wheel clue on its own, especially since we didn't even find out what the toast was for years.
- HIP 12248 is certainly a long way from Pareco, so would be fairly well favoured as its tip-off site.
- because of the "only once per cycle" rule you can probably knock HIP 12248 out of your tip-off cycles semi-persistently once you do it
- It's also one of the "permanent" sites, rather than one on a cycle, so you don't fail to find it 11 weeks in 12 ... and it's probably sufficiently well-positioned to not be masked too much by the temporary ones
- That specific tip-off site, unique among them, does something special on activation (necessarily, perhaps, only if activated from a tip-off sourced from Pareco)
- tip-offs are sufficiently unattractive to min-maxers that someone not specifically looking for clues would probably not follow it up, and Pareco pre-SCO would have been an annoying place to look for them even for people like me who like them (so it would be sufficient obfuscation to explain "why has no-one done this before?")

actually .... that might explain why i stopped getting the tip-off ..... once i was allied i largely stopped doing faction missions hahahahha. i literally do half a dozen once in a blue moon to top up the carrier reserves. right, time to load up again.
