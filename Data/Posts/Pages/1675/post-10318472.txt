SAP8...Solo it with cargo hatch limpets?
And any tips as it's rising up the list for things I need to try as no one has sold one to my fleet carrier so far

One thing I want to try is hanging out in some systems and see who comes sniffing for the cargo and see if it's more than just pirates.... If the DW finds you and you can't find them it might trigger something...

Oh and where did you get the trinkets from... Want to carry some of those too!
IIRC Trinkets can be obtained (infrequently, about 1 ship every 30 or so minutes) at Compromised Nav Beacon locations. Use a cargo scanner & collection limpets. Have good shields because as soon as they emerge from target's cargo hold the pirates get into a feeding frenzy. Usually Adders. But I found a few passenger ships carrying them. IIRC one Dolphin had 100, I managed to get 4....there's a suitable system quite close to Shinrarta
