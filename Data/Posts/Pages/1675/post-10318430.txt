Because of rounding I would suggest. In game the values presented to the player to view are not accurate due to it being pointless to present everything to the players with 6 decimal point precision.
Let me get this correct, you're saying that if I was looking for exactly 3,155,760 ls might be impossible to dumbing down it for the players?
