Just a little math; (c=speed of light in a vacuum. Please note that the values shown are from a quick google search and are not precise, but precise enough for here.)

1c = 300,000km per second. (ish)
1Ls = 300,000km
.01c = 3000 km per second, or if used to measure distance, 3000km. (.01Ls)
So to hit a 2000km diameter object (dead center or zero) using a scale that measures in 3000km increments, there is an inherent 4000km deviation before even stepping into the cockpit. That's plus or minus .01Ls from zero, minus the 2000km diameter (1000km radius)
The 3.63Ls distance is from theoretical planet center. The rise to run of 1 deg. at a distance of 1km = 17.452km.
The rise to run of 1deg at 3.63Ls = 19,005,670km (0.63Ls) Taking into consideration the radius of the start planet will only change this by about 100km.
So ya, the idea of aiming at a single pixel is pretty accurate. (My kitty just lost a leg so I'm feelin... wierd and mathy.)
