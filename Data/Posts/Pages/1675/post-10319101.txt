I had a look in to the 'Jewel of Cassiopeia' just to take a break. I searched Ruchbah, segin, schedar and Caph. Caph considered the 'Jewel'. The only planet I found something on was in Segin. It had an unmapped planet, the only unmapped planet. It's probably nothing, but it did have an Impact site with no threat level. Furthermore, it did have 3 unshielded skimmers and a pyramid shaped Human building with a rather large main door. It's probably nothing, but I'd thought I'd mention it.
I will admit i have not seen all the building types in elite. (the amount is staggering once you count both all horizons and odyssey types plus the faction installations)

However, a pyramid shaped building is not something i have ever seen in elite, not even in a screenshot. Are you able to post one?

The "whisper in witchspace" looked a bit like a pyramid with an eye at one point; the typical freemason thingie.

In any case, finding an unmapped planet in the bubble at this point shows how little is explored.
