I had a look in to the 'Jewel of Cassiopeia' just to take a break. I searched Ruchbah, segin, schedar and Caph. Caph considered the 'Jewel'. The only planet I found something on was in Segin. It had an unmapped planet, the only unmapped planet. It's probably nothing, but it did have an Impact site with no threat level. Furthermore, it did have 3 unshielded skimmers and a pyramid shaped Human building with a rather large main door. It's probably nothing, but I'd thought I'd mention it.
