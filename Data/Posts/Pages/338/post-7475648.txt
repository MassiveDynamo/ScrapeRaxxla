I have found something strange.

There is a HIP system outside of the Bubble (though not terribly far out) that is not showing discovery or mapped tags, including my own. Having both discovered and mapped dozens of HIP stars and planets, this is not normal. The only places I've seen that prevent tags are places inside the Bubble, like Sol.

Could this mean this system is important, or is this just a bug I don't know about?

Could it be that it’s just no one has been there yet? It’s really rare but last year I came across a system in bubble that was unclaimed. Map it, turn in your data and then check it out the system map again.
But as you say could also be a problem with the game itself. I went to the thargoid base in Aries Dark Region DB-X D-3 yesterday and visited the base after coming across the abandoned survey vessel “Victoria’s Song” that was attacked by the Black Flight. But the system where he Thargoid base is isn’t marked as being a Thargoid civilization on the GalMap like the others are.
