I wonder if Michael belongs to the Children of Tothos too. Today on Archambault Terminal we are meditating on magical syllables and numbers derived from demons, trees, and indecipherable sentences. People on old Earth had so many languages, today most of them are used for advocating tourism. 252. I have performed a ritual washing with yet another bottle of Water of Shintara, carbonated, and had a moment of relief from my recent duties for contemplation. Having survived both Titan's Daughter and the Gnosis, there perhaps could be a small chance of survival in this trial also. Moments like these are often interrupted by booming echoes of explosions near the perimeter of the station, or singalongs to ancient hymns from old Earth, believed to hold potent symbolism. Solitary candle in the Villa of Ormen? I don't understand what these words mean. I am told having been familiar with this method of thinking in a previous digital reincarnation, and that I'm being directed to yet another world of dust storms, non-linearity and starvation.

I was on the Gnosis when it was attacked. Keeping parked on the station when offline now because if it does go boom I donâ€™t wanna miss out on the EDSM badge
