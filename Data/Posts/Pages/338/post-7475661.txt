I'm not that stupid, LOL. You apparently missed "including my own", and planets don't show up in the system map untagged before discovery, thanks to the new "fog of war" game mechanic (which I love, BTW).

That’s true. Hmm. If you can get a system name I’ll try and look at it under my account later and see if I get the same result.
Something off the topic to add but just crossed my mind. Soontill (Which doesn’t appear to be the soontill we have in game, seems the actual one is yet to be found by us) was said to be obscured in a “space fog” which made it hard to find. Now that we have Lagrange clouds, could it be that Raxxla is hidden away in one of those? Would be interesting.
