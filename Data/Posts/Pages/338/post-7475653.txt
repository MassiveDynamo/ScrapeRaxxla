Could it be that it’s just no one has been there yet? It’s really rare but last year I came across a system in bubble that was unclaimed. Map it, turn in your data and then check it out the system map again..

I'm not that stupid, LOL. You apparently missed "including my own", and planets don't show up in the system map untagged before discovery, thanks to the new "fog of war" game mechanic (which I love, BTW).
