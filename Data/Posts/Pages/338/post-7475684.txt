Ra ( system Ra ) xx ( Roman Numerals =20 ) La ( Lagrange cloud )? This went through my mind last night. I also thought Ra might mean Right Ascension but there is not enough numerical data. The system Ra was interesting and Rahas ( related to Ra ) came up with nothing. I read ( again ) the Dark Wheel Novella buy Rob Holstock ( a wonderful story from my childhood ) this morning, noted all characters and places mentioned. We also did a data dump ( live on youtube ) a while back looking for all systems ( 2048 of them ) from the original game that are in E.D. There were not many but Ra was in there.
