Question: is everyone here allied with the Dark Wheel faction? Also, anyone regularly run tourist missions for them? You never know, maybe one of their VIP "tourists" will take us somewhere interesting! I might try this myself.

Yes, I’m allied with them. Not run any missions for them for while but I remember an Elite tourist mission (about 7 businessmen) last Autumn from SD to a nearby tourist system about 13ly away, can’t remember the system name. Got several million Cr for 10 minutes run and an elite assassination mission as a follow-on. Didnt take it for roleplay (& rheumatism) reasons but did wonder if it was a recruitment test.
