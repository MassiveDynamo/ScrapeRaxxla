I'm personally fond of "Watchers of the Sky" which was part one of Alfred Noyle's The Torch-Bearers trilogy. Noyles was inspired by the first testing by starlight of the Mount Wilson Observatory's 100-inch telescope. It's an epic poem dedicated to astronomy. It's from The Torch-Bearers that I pulled my current signature:

"Not thine to understand
How the two worlds accord-
The Will of Love Our Lord
With this dark wheel of Time"
I like it. However, ‘Watch the Skies’ pertains to Thargoids via Galcop, so it’s already got substantial meaning in-game. Not that I’d be adverse to having a name that involves a bit of misdirection I hasten to add.
