Makes sense, however the name then provides a problem; Light Wheel? White Wheel?
FRifters seems to me to be a better name, can’t remember Thatchinho’s idea.
but that is a good philosophy statement for what this (& the previous) thread is all about, so makes sense for it to be the raison d’etre for a squadron. I suggest:
PvE, Private Group
Superpower/Power/Faction-independent
suggest the squadron 4-character ID tag is DEEP as in: searching the deep black & researching deep mysteries etc (my first ship was DEEP THOUGHT & all my ships follow the same naming convention, my second Cmdr is a male Rasalas relative & will continue the family tradition )

edit: of course the name doesn’t have to define the purpose, that’s the philosophy statement. So FRifters might be apropos since it was the first mystery that brought us together; we can still have a wider purpose.
It’s ‘The Rifters Lounge’ in the Beta. It’s just for doing testing as part of the Beta though, nothing more.
