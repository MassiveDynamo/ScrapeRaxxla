Hi there,

been an avid reader for a long time, but never felt I could rly contribute up until now.

While thinking about Braben's statement (Every player has to make the journey to Raxxla for him/herself [or something like that]), it came to my mind that maybe Raxxla is hidden behind the same wall as the original way to become a Jedi in SWG.

For all those who never played that game, you could only become a jedi, when you visited a certain number of locations and mastered some traits (the game originally had no class system).

Since we do know that Raxxla was in the game from the beginning and certein features were not, the locations would have to be certain stations. Maybe the possession of a certain ship. The Elite rank can be expected, but not necessarily. And so on.

Of course Braben's statement can be interpreted the buddhist way, that Raxxla is the game, but I do like the idea.
So, your thoughts?
