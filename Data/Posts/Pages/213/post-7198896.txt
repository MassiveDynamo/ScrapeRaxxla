Makes sense, however the name then provides a problem; Light Wheel? White Wheel?
FRifters seems to me to be a better name, can’t remember Thatchinho’s idea.

I'm personally fond of "Watchers of the Sky" which was part one of Alfred Noyle's The Torch-Bearers trilogy. Noyles was inspired by the first testing by starlight of the Mount Wilson Observatory's 100-inch telescope. It's an epic poem dedicated to astronomy. It's from The Torch-Bearers that I pulled my current signature:

"Not thine to understand
How the two worlds accord-
The Will of Love Our Lord
With this dark wheel of Time"
