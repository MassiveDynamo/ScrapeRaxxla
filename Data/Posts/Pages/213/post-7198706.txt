@Thargoid: hope life is improving for you now mate! Looking forward to your next book...



Nod’s as good as a wink to a blind bat!
so there is more to find out in the FRift; Thatchinho we definitely need that FRifters squadron! I’m shortly going to set up a second Cmdr; will develop his credit balance to get a reasonable reserve & then get an AspX to go searching again. Anyone interested in teaming up? Do we need to create a new FRifter’s thread since this one should be dedicated to Questing for Raxxla?

Would suggest that, rather than setup a separate FRifter's squad ... we setup a squad that actually fulfills the original intentions of The Dark Wheel, which is NOT just the quest for Raxxla. From Holdstock:

"The Dark Wheel was a semi-legendary space unit, star-riders who made it their business to seek the truth behind the plethora of myths and romantic stories that filtered back from all corners of the Universe: fabulous cities, parallel worlds, time travellers, even planets that appeared to be the old 'heaven' of Earth legend. The Dark Wheel was as mysterious and as mythical to the traders of the Galaxy as King Arthur might have been to the first spacemen."

Raxxla is just one story out of many. Soontil was another and the Formidine Rift was yet one more.
