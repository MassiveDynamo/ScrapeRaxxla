G'day

I haven't been involved with FD for a long time unfortunately. Would love to be working with Elite still. Got hit with a cancer/divorce combo right after the novel launch, right when it would have been a good time to keep conversations going. Alas I wallowed instead. I have had various other projects since, including a new novel 'The Bezerker' which has been read by a few lucky alpha readers (a few of which are on these forums). Running it through another edit currently, with plans to find a publisher once done.
Hey! Thanks for posting!

Very sorry to hear about what happened, I had no idea. It sounds like things are getting back on track for you so I hope that’s indeed the case and that things continue to get better.

With all the INRA legacy stuff that went on earlier in the year along with all activity from the security services that went along with it, I thought that there was a few thematic connections to And Here The Wheel, hence wondering if you’d been back involved.

Anyway, it’d be good to see you involved with ED again, so for what it’s worth consider this a voice of support on that!

Hope it all goes well with the new book!
