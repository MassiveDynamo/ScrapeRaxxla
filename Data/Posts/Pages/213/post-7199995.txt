I'm personally fond of "Watchers of the Sky" which was part one of Alfred Noyle's The Torch-Bearers trilogy. Noyles was inspired by the first testing by starlight of the Mount Wilson Observatory's 100-inch telescope. It's an epic poem dedicated to astronomy. It's from The Torch-Bearers that I pulled my current signature:

"Not thine to understand
How the two worlds accord-
The Will of Love Our Lord
With this dark wheel of Time"

It’s ‘The Rifters Lounge’ in the Beta. It’s just for doing testing as part of the Beta though, nothing more.

As Thatchinho says Watchers of the Sky sounds too similar to something already in-game, and it’s a bit of a mouthful, and we do more than watch but actively seek to solve mysteries. To my mind Rifter’s Lounge sounds like the bar that the squadron meets up in rather than a squadron (though we will need a bar, with cheeseboard, petit fours and a large decanter of Lavian brandy (at the very least)). How about:
Mythbusters
Veritas
Themis
Sleuths
Bloodhounds
FRaxxlers
Personally I still prefer FRifters!

Questers
Inquisitors
