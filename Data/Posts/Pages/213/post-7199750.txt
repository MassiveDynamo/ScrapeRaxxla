The 'Watch the Skies' reference is from one of the logs you get if you scan the uplinks on the GCS Sarasvati in IC 4604 Sector FB-X c1-16. There is also a Listening Post in Jotunheim (near the moon 7a iirc) related to this that also mentions GalCop.

Yep, this. One of the logs is an extract from a video which AFAIK was produced by the Galcop group, here:

It's well worth a watch.

Also FD dropped 'Watch the Skies' into their messages pretty much non-stop in the build up to the Gnosis's attempted jump into the Cone sector.

My understanding with the Galcop player group was that there was a few conditions from FD for them to be able to use the name, largely centred around them adhering to, and fleshing out lore. I don't have the full details though.

Edit - a bit more info wrt the player group here: https://community.elitedangerous.com/en/Galcop
