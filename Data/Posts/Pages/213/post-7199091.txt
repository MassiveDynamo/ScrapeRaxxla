Would suggest that, rather than setup a separate FRifter's squad ... we setup a squad that actually fulfills the original intentions of The Dark Wheel, which is NOT just the quest for Raxxla. From Holdstock:

"The Dark Wheel was a semi-legendary space unit, star-riders who made it their business to seek the truth behind the plethora of myths and romantic stories that filtered back from all corners of the Universe: fabulous cities, parallel worlds, time travellers, even planets that appeared to be the old 'heaven' of Earth legend. The Dark Wheel was as mysterious and as mythical to the traders of the Galaxy as King Arthur might have been to the first spacemen."

Raxxla is just one story out of many. Soontil was another and the Formidine Rift was yet one more.
I concur.
