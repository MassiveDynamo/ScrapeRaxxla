Watched OA’s vid this morning and saw the reference to DrewW’s lore Q&A on reddit https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDange...ith_the_q4_exploration_content_about_to_drop/

interesting: “The Formidine Rift and other known lore sectors have now been officially listed in the galactic map, so it would appear that more remains to be found out there...”

Nod’s as good as a wink to a blind bat!
so there is more to find out in the FRift; Thatchinho we definitely need that FRifters squadron! I’m shortly going to set up a second Cmdr; will develop his credit balance to get a reasonable reserve & then get an AspX to go searching again. Anyone interested in teaming up? Do we need to create a new FRifter’s thread since this one should be dedicated to Questing for Raxxla?
