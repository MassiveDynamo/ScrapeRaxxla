I like it. However, ‘Watch the Skies’ pertains to Thargoids via Galcop, so it’s already got substantial meaning in-game. Not that I’d be adverse to having a name that involves a bit of misdirection I hasten to add.

Interesting. Reference? My understanding is that, aside from Holdstock's original TDW novella and Space Trader's Training Manual Galcop was just another player group. Has something lore-related featuring Galcop been released? (I've been out of game for a while and waiting for Beyond Chapter Four to drop to get back in).
