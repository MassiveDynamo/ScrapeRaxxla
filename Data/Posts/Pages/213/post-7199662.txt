Interesting. Reference? My understanding is that, aside from Holdstock's original TDW novella and Space Trader's Training Manual Galcop was just another player group. Has something lore-related featuring Galcop been released? (I've been out of game for a while and waiting for Beyond Chapter Four to drop to get back in).
The 'Watch the Skies' reference is from one of the logs you get if you scan the uplinks on the GCS Sarasvati in IC 4604 Sector FB-X c1-16. There is also a Listening Post in Jotunheim (near the moon 7a iirc) related to this that also mentions GalCop.
