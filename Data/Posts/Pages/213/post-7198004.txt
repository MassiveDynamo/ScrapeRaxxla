G'day

I haven't been involved with FD for a long time unfortunately. Would love to be working with Elite still. Got hit with a cancer/divorce combo right after the novel launch, right when it would have been a good time to keep conversations going. Alas I wallowed instead. I have had various other projects since, including a new novel 'The Bezerker' which has been read by a few lucky alpha readers (a few of which are on these forums). Running it through another edit currently, with plans to find a publisher once done.

Sounds like you had a tough go of it. Sorry to hear. Would have loved to have read a sequel to And Here the Wheel. Let us know when The Bezerker gets published.
