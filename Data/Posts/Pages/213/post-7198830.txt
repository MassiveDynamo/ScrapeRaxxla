Squadron suggestion

Would suggest that, rather than setup a separate FRifter's squad ... we setup a squad that actually fulfills the original intentions of The Dark Wheel, which is NOT just the quest for Raxxla. From Holdstock:

"The Dark Wheel was a semi-legendary space unit, star-riders who made it their business to seek the truth behind the plethora of myths and romantic stories that filtered back from all corners of the Universe: fabulous cities, parallel worlds, time travellers, even planets that appeared to be the old 'heaven' of Earth legend. The Dark Wheel was as mysterious and as mythical to the traders of the Galaxy as King Arthur might have been to the first spacemen."

Raxxla is just one story out of many. Soontil was another and the Formidine Rift was yet one more.

Makes sense, however the name then provides a problem; Light Wheel? White Wheel?
FRifters seems to me to be a better name, can’t remember Thatchinho’s idea.
but that is a good philosophy statement for what this (& the previous) thread is all about, so makes sense for it to be the raison d’etre for a squadron. I suggest:
PvE, Private Group
Superpower/Power/Faction-independent
suggest the squadron 4-character ID tag is DEEP as in: searching the deep black & researching deep mysteries etc (my first ship was DEEP THOUGHT & all my ships follow the same naming convention, my second Cmdr is a male Rasalas relative & will continue the family tradition )

edit: of course the name doesn’t have to define the purpose, that’s the philosophy statement. So FRifters might be apropos since it was the first mystery that brought us together; we can still have a wider purpose.
