Despite that notebook thing I had criticisms about a few posts ago, I do have ideas that involve Guardians being relevant to Raxxla in some way though. In what way, I haven't figured that out yet, if there is any relevancy to begin with.
Somebody built the Umphalos Rift, so in my mind the Guardians are a good guess.
