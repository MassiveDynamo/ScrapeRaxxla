I get that, but I'm getting tired of some of these posts trying to take the p!ss. I'm legit trying to get facts seperated from fiction, not muddy up what we hardly know to begin with even more
If you find my posts too difficult to parse please feel free to ignore them. I wouldnt want to disrupt your truth quest. Enjoy
