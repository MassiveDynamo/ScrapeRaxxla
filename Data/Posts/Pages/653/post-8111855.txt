I get that, but I'm getting tired of some of these posts trying to take the p!ss. I'm legit trying to get facts seperated from fiction, not muddy up what we hardly know to begin with even more
Most facts are reflected in the OP, unfortunately I cannot rule out that I've missed one or two...

PS: I must admit that I enjoy all contributions, especially when I see that effort are put into it.
