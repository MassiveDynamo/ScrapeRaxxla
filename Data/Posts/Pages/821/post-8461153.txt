One thing from Drew's stream that caught my attention was from someone in chat they posted what I can only assume is a quote from something, I haven't gotten around to looking into it just yet but I copied it from there...

I said thine eyes were stars, thy breast the milk'n way, Thy fingers Cupid's shafts, thy voice the angels' lay : And all I said so well, as no man it denied.

I read this and thought of the Mother of Galaxies line from the toast, that line about the burning jewel has always struck me, maybe something to do with Gaia as in Greek myth. I searched for Gaia on the GM and it returned a system with a totally different name, Flesk, when I Googled it I got results for a Scandinavian word for bacon... so that was a dead end. The quote above though could be interesting, I'm going to look into it

UPDATE It's an old sonnet referenced before, ASTROPHEL AND STELLA, nothing new, stand down
