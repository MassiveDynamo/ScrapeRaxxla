agreed we probably wont learn anything new as he doesn't know anything as it was off-limits or covered by an NDA. What he does know does interest me, how DB & MB introduced stuff into the game working with the authors for example, to me it gives insight into how or what Raxxla can be, not necessarily where it is.

2 hours of total speculation and tinfoil Im looking forward to, 90 mins of fdev bashing will leave me annoyed, to coin a phrase 'It could be so much better' and maybe its because Ive been on a few expeditions that are better organised so my expectations are higher. I too do my own thing, I just wish there was enough there to keep me occupied without having to do my own thing, Id like to be involved in what we are doing not just listening. Moan over, like I said I still want it to be great as it could bring a whole lot of players into the lore and the game including people I know in RL and in game, negativity wont attract them or make the game better.

Slightly off topic but the thread that tries to find out what system the DW station is in based on the Codex screenshot has taken an interesting turn of late.
