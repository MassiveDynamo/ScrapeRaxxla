Theres not a lot of lore and a lot of what 'fdev did wrong' with phrases like 'I could be cruel and say' and then says it. Pretty obvious a lot of bitterness because he totally messed up the Salome chase by handing it over to his own personal sycophant club when fdev wanted it available to the whole community, that's why fdev haven't even tried to do another one, real shame as could have been the start of something great but cliques and egos killed it before it even started.

Not a lot of research either, trying to enter Permit locked systems and filling time by repeating himself and loading different games, preparation would have loaded the game before and found out it was Permit locked.

Been a real disappointment so far, hence the low viewing figures and people switching off.

I keep hoping it will actually be great as have looked forward to it since announcement, its just been a massive let-down so far..
