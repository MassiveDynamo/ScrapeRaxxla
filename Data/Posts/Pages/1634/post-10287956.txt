Unfortunately I was a noob at that time and crashed on that trip, losing a year of exploration data.
Ouch! Sorry to hear that.

The exploration itch kicked in and now I'm heading in this region in an attempt to find something with my carrier, all exploration ships that I have with various modules equipped and some thargoid/guardian items just in case its needed for some experiment.
I hope you find something awesome

The Empyrean is interesting, as a word, I often wonder if Fdev was thinking about specific things when they named some places. Some were definitely named by the community, but others weren't.
