With all the theories, research etc. in which region do you think Raxxla is?
With 42 regions its a lot of ground to cover.

My gut tells me it is somewhere in Empyrean Straits... Don't know why and can't back it up but something tells me there is more to discover there.
Personally, my latest idea is that there's something significant to find in the Galactic Centre region... so right next door to your idea!... relatively speaking.

Love to hear more about what you think there might be there? I just visited some Guardian sites in the Empyrean Straits
