My other next part of this is to try to track the first mention of this "Raxxla was visited" myth.
Poking around the forum search, the first mention I can find is https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/page-406#post-7800401 in this thread in May 2019 ... which - I had to laugh - mentions it as if it was an old rumour that everyone already knows about, and gives a different convention as an original source.

Going back to actual 2017, nothing I found on various keywords fits, but there are three separate things which could easily have ended up combined in people's memories a couple of years later:
1) Various quotes or paraphrases from DB and/or MB along the lines of "Raxxla is in the game and we know where it is"
2) Lots of player speculation that the system might have been visited but only honked
3) Someone (or possibly two different someones at different times) claiming to have found Raxxla in a system that had already been visited

(Any forum searches for "Raxxla" and another keyword seem to be pretty quiet throughout most of 2017/2018 - the Codex release seems to have been the spark to really get people interested in it again)
