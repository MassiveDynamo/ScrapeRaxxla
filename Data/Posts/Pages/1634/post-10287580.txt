As a reminder, this is what Ascorbious said (from this post)
What Ascorbius said to me was:
“It was during a closed Q&A session - I'm trying to recall whether it was Lavecon or the later ECM in Reading. It was the last Q&A Michael Brookes was at.

I'm pretty sure it was Lavecon 2017 in the Q&A. There were a load of things announced there, Crime and Punishment and the early views of AX weapons as well as Search and Rescue.
I've also just checked Michael Brookes announced he was stepping away from Elite at Lavecon 2017 so it's pretty unlikely to be the ECM Reading.

The memory is hazy given that I've been to a few Lavecons and ECMs and recollections after the fact are unreliable but I'm pretty sure it was Lavecon 2017.

But I absolutely was there when he said it, it's sad there's no footage with it being a closed Q&A, but there were a lot of people in the room.

I didn't go to Lavecon 2016 or 2015 so it's definitely not that those.”

More sources (in addition to my previous post) that bring into doubt what Ascorbius says:

From this thread: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-5599978

Literally not a single post between June 12 and July 11. Lavecon was June 24th. Unless it's all been deleted, you'd expect to find at least a single person posting here "Hey, Brookes at Lavecon said Raxxla had been visited".

This Reddit thread:

Lists all the Folks involved in the Q&A panel and what they showed off. Obviously Brookes is not listed, but comparing that to the blog post in my previous post you can see there's a match here with what was reported there, and what Ascorbius said was discussed at the Q&A. Edit: meant to say, there are plenty of people here on the forums and even on that reddit thread there posting after Lavecon 2017 discussing the Q&A, and not a single one mentions Brookes or Raxxla.

Here's the Lavecon 2017 Thread, suspiciously free of Raxxla and Brookes revelations: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/lavecon-2017.358839/page-3



Here's the presentation video from the Q&A Lavecon 2017: No mention of Brookes or Raxxla in the comments. Not a single one.

Nothing about Raxxla or Borookes in any post about Lavecon 2017 that I've found, so Ascorbius very clearly misremembered that entirely.



He does say it might have been ECM in Reading, so I'll have a look for that next I guess! My other next part of this is to try to track the first mention of this "Raxxla was visited" myth.
