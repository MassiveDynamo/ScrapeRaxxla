Personally, my latest idea is that there's something significant to find in the Galactic Centre region... so right next door to your idea!... relatively speaking.

Love to hear more about what you think there might be there? I just visited some Guardian sites in the Empyrean Straits

Before we received FSS and had to visit the planet up close for a scan I was exploring Empyrean Straits in a semi-engineered Anaconda.
There were talks about the guardian sites on this forum and there was a saying that brain trees indicate that there is a guardian ruin nearby (within 50ly if memory serves me correct) and I happen to stumble upon on them far away from the current sites in the Empyrean Straits region.

This leads me to believe that there is more to it in this region. After looking at the heat maps at EDAstro it does not look that much explored considering the star density of the region.

Unfortunately I was a noob at that time and crashed on that trip, losing a year of exploration data.
To make matters worse I didn't even use EDMC, EDSM, Inara or any kind of helper tool to track my progress and/or travel path.
In my attempt to recover the systems visited I found out about these tools and started using them ever since.
Unrelated to Raxxla I ragequit the game for some time, on return I did other activities.

The exploration itch kicked in and now I'm heading in this region in an attempt to find something with my carrier, all exploration ships that I have with various modules equipped and some thargoid/guardian items just in case its needed for some experiment.
