Just a thought: while in bubble we can point to sagittarius A* and the landscape signal can be found in audio recordings.
Did anyone tried to do the opposite, i mean going far from bubble and point to specific system in the bubble and look for any audio weirdness?
Someone... somewhere.... (I'll try to find the post) said they aimed at Earth while on the opposite side of Sag A* and got some very weird audio.

I'm going to try it when I get there just in case I doubt it'll reveal anything. If there's any other systems you want me to do the same for send a list.
