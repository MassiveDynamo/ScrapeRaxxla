Soooo, went out to Yoruba scanned al the planets, had a poke about and found exactly nothing! I do think there is a tourist beacon or some clue that we need to find to start a chain of events or unlock some kind of map but where it starts I don't now. I think I might head for the old worlds from the original Elite (lave etc) and have a poke about. o7 Commanders, never give up the hunt!
