Hello, I'm a long time lurker. I just wanted to share a reddit post I saw a few years ago. A CMDR logged back in to his ship inside a star. My point is that the flare effects he saw look identical (in my opinion) to the artifacts that show up at The Star of India and other stars.

In my opinion I think these can be dismissed as only graphical errors, if not a bit creepy to see.
Excellent find
