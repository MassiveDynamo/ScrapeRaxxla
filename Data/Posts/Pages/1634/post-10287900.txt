Hello, I'm a long time lurker. I just wanted to share a reddit post I saw a few years ago. A CMDR logged back in to his ship inside a star. My point is that the flare effects he saw look identical (in my opinion) to the artifacts that show up at The Star of India and other stars.

In my opinion I think these can be dismissed as only graphical errors, if not a bit creepy to see.
What you see in pic. 1 and three, is the same you see when you check these phenomenon in VR. The system map is fully 3D even in monitor view. In VR you can move inside the phenomenon and see them close.
