Actually, check out this post a few replies after the one made by Jorki explaining about Ascorbius and the Q&A:



Thanks @CMDR Davanix

Sadly that blog isn't available, but the wayback machine is... Here's the link.

Here's the quote:
Because of D-d-d-d-david Braben's message overrun and the general enthusiasm in the hall, the Q&A had barely started at 3pm when our second game of Artemis was booked! So the boys and I sneaked out of the hall early. I knew from the past two LaveCon's, no amount of squeezing would get any more info out of Frontier's panel, so I wasn't too worried I'd miss anything. I had this confirmed later by another CMDR.

So this is someone who was so into Elite that their website was literally called elite-dangerous-blog-co.uk and they wrote an extensive blog about Lavecon 2017.

But they never mentioned Brookes at all, and no mention of Raxxla.

For me, this pretty much confirms that Raxxla wasn't mentioned. No-one that's been to three Lavecons, has a blog like this, and is present at a Lavecon where any official staff mentions Raxxla and doesn't say a single word about it.
