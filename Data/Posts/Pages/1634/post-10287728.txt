With all the theories, research etc. in which region do you think Raxxla is?
With 42 regions its a lot of ground to cover.

My gut tells me it is somewhere in Empyrean Straits... Don't know why and can't back it up but something tells me there is more to discover there.
You know, I've been planning to visit around there for some time now, touring Eta Carina, Dryman permit locked bubble, Norma Arm and coreward across the Arcadian Stream. Star density becomes huge in regions adjacent to the core, and there are many rarely visited planetary nebulae hidden beneath the stars. There's nothing quite like the feeling of being thousands of lightyears away from civilization, though I suppose all regions have service fleetcarriers or some such these days.
