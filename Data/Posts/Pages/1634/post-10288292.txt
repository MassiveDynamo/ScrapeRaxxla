Almost all of them are hand picked in RA/DEC coordinates. But the thing is, some star names are different in catalouges, and in game some of their names are not false, but incomplete. Check https://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/ or https://www.universeguide.com/ for alternative names, maybe something is wrong, or misnamed.
Yea, confirmed its got the same HIP name and RA/DEC in both of those catalogs as well now,
So literally everywhere except in-game I can find, it's got the same Name, and same coordinates.
It's just in-games that's got a different coordinate/ RA/DEC

I thought the base of the game was the HIP and HID catalogs ect, using their IRL info, and then the galaxy propagated out with ProcGen based on NASA/ESA star density calculations/estimates ?


Does anyone know of a website that can change time? LOL
As in, enter a star coordinate now, and see where it will have moved in relation to Earth over 1300 years?
