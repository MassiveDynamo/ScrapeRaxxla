It was in the 3150s. The original Elite where we play as JJ, starts in 3125. The Mycoid bombing ends the first Thargiod war. When we start FE2 in 3200 as, there are no Thargoids around.
Any Mycoid used in the 3250s is uncertain. The 3250s was the time of FFE, with it's multiple possible endings. It's possible that it happened, but it hasn't been confirmed and it wasn't done by JJ.

You play as CMDR Jameson in the original Elite (1984), which starts in 3125. That Jameson is Peter...
FE2 has no Thargoids - the original skirmishes have ended.
FFE in 3250, has been confirmed by FDev as having the ending where Mycoid is delivered. JJ is Peter's grandson.
