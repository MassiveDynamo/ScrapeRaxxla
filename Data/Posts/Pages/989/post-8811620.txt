beacon 0184 indicates first contact with thargoids, right? But in lighthouse 0187 there is already a mention of thargoids. The difference there is 300-400 years ...

It doesn't say Thargoids were proved to have been responsible. It reads like:

"Why did 13 ships vanish?"
"erm...... aliens?...... oh, BTW, here's a massive military fleet which we can place here because of 'aliens'"
