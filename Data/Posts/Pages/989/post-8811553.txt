Another is an entry from the Wiki which says that JJ used mycoid in the mid 3100's... it PROBABLY should say Mid 31st Century, which would put it more correctly around 3250
It was in the 3150s. The original Elite where we play as JJ, starts in 3125. The Mycoid bombing ends the first Thargiod war. When we start FE2 in 3200 as, there are no Thargoids around.
Any Mycoid used in the 3250s is uncertain. The 3250s was the time of FFE, with it's multiple possible endings. It's possible that it happened, but it hasn't been confirmed and it wasn't done by JJ.
