You play as CMDR Jameson in the original Elite (1984), which starts in 3125. That Jameson is Peter...
FE2 has no Thargoids - the original skirmishes have ended.
FFE in 3250, has been confirmed by FDev as having the ending where Mycoid is delivered. JJ is Peter's grandson.

Not quite. J. Jameson Jnr. is Peters grandson and the son of John. It's the character we play in FE2. Peter dies in 3200 and leaves a ship for his grandson: https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/docs.php?id=679

J. Jameson Jnr. is probably 'kiddo' from the John Jameson logs: https://canonn.science/codex/cmdr-john-jameson-crashed-cobra-mkiii/

When we play FFE it's clear from the "The Thargoids: Truth and Fiction" by Dr Joreb Innitu (confirmed lore in TB 0152), that Mycoid was used in the past and that it ended the first conflict.
