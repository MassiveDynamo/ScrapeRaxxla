The FDev lore summary also confirms 3150 as the mycoid attack, but to have a second attack in FFE?

Hang on... I've misinterpreted something. Han, you are correct and I'm an idiot
If the attack in FFE happened it should be on the Thargoid home world, Miackce (col 70 sector fy-n c21-3?). Not a Thargoid base close to the bubble.
