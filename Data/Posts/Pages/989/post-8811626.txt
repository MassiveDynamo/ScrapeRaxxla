It doesn't say Thargoids were proved to have been responsible. It reads like:

"Why did 13 ships vanish?"
"erm...... aliens?...... oh, BTW, here's a massive military fleet which we can place here because of 'aliens'"
I'm talking about something else. So it was known about the thargoids a very long time ago, once the word is mentioned in the lighthouse not aliens, but thargoids. So beacon 0184 is lying to some extent, this was not the first contact. If I understood everything correctly.
