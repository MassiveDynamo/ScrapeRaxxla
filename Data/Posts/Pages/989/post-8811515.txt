A major discrepency is that according to beacon 0245, the Pilot's Federation issue the first set of Elite wings in 3100. They are awarded to Peter Jameson - who doesn't actually make it to Elite until 3125.... I have interpreted that error as the PF create the Elite rank in 3100, but award the first in 3125.

Another is an entry from the Wiki which says that JJ used mycoid in the mid 3100's... it PROBABLY should say Mid 33rd Century (edit) which would put it more correctly around 3250
