Hello.. It was said that Raxxla could be located between the Crab Nebula and the Cubeo system and a possible occurrence in the OOCHORS systems, not far from the bubble.. In my research and search for information about Raxxla I came across the Interactive Galaxy Map at https:// edastro.com/ and there is a dark wheel on it.. It should be in the places of the CONE nebula.. And under the CONE nebula are the OOCHORS systems.. I remembered the DARK WHEEL.. I am flying there to explore the systems with KGBFOAM stars. o7
Keep us updated Cmdr!
