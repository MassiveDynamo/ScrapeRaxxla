So in lieu of the new ships, which ship and configuration is now your preferred Raxxla hunter ship?

I made use of the Python mk2 yesterday to get my hits in on Thor. Tried the titan stuff early on but wasnt keen on all the engineering grind i had to do to get a ship i could use- anyhow ya was fun learning the titan attack game mechanic and repeatedly dying until i was able to muddle my way through it.

For general raxxla hunting im sticking to my trusty AspX
