Shame - looks like we possibly missed out on a Raxxla test with the recent Utopia campaigns. Well atleast one of them somewhat completed. Utopia was working with the "Guardians of Harmony".... The whole digital consciousness idea is verymuch inline with the Holdstock Raxxla idea. Essentially a death of the body and rebirth as digital entity. Much like Salvation and atleast some of the Guardians. I think anything Utopia does should be supported - if just to see where it takes us. Not that im a fan of "Utopia" but even if it turns out bad - i think it will get us somewhre... "No faith alone can unlock their prison, but science has the key. The elder ones await our discoveries with keen hunger."

Also the Acheron Interface could be the key. I imagine it is of course a reference to Achernar and the river Acheron - the Enterance to the Underworld. Think of our intrepid Boatman Kharon.... and Alista\Allissia\Elyssia Fields... In "living in hope" Kharon and Alista were supposedly from the community of the "Fathers of the Pure Soul" - wiped out in an Earthquake. I had asssumed that it was associated with Van Maanens Star.... and the "Guardians of the Free Spirit" - but maybe Polevnic?

Just a side note - the Marlinists..... the name Marlin can refer to the fish of course or possibly; "dweller at the famous land"... Myrddin welsh for Sea Fort... or a form of Merlin. I think the Marlinist groups also need more attention from us. The early life forms found on Achenar were called mudlacks.... someone who scavenges along the banks and shores of rivers.... The River being the Eridanus (or Acheron?) that ends at Achenar (well in classical times it would have ended in Acamar) and starts in Orion....

Also I suggest we all try to get our star for fighting the Stargoids.... I think this might be important as it is billed as an epic battle - maybe another Hells Gate?
