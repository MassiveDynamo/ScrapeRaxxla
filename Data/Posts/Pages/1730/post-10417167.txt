"The elder ones await our discoveries with keen hunger" - sounds more like Cthulhu than Guardians!

Though iirc MB was quite keen on Cthulhu

Holdstock had some cthulhu in his stories... Where the Time Winds has creatures called Gulgaroths - which i imagine are referring to the Gol-Goroth from a Cthulhu story "Children of the Night" by Robert Howard. I was wondering about the "Fear" from Holdstocks book "Eye Among the Blind" that was taking over entire worlds and killing everyone - if it was atleast in some way similar to the Nyarlathotep by Lovecraft. "A sense of monstrous guilt was upon the land, and out of the abysses between the stars swept chill currents that made men shiver in dark and lonely places." - from Nyarlathotep. I can see MB picking up on that for his take on things in ED - especially as Nyarlathotep was expanded on alot in subsequent Cthulhu stories.

I dont think the assention to a higher plane idea is contained soley in the Guardians wheelhouse - Looking at both Guardian Beacons and Thargoid Devices - they are machines that seem to be associated with transformation. We know that the Guardians were working with essentailly a digital consciousness (like Antal) - We dont know if the Thargoids "higher plane" is the same - and i suspect it is different, but possibly simmilar in ways...
