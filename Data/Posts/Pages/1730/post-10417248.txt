How did you get your Phantom to that high jump range ? ( i've barely gotten my DBX to 65 Ly range ...so far at least )

EDSY - 70 Ly Phantom build

There is a lot of engineering, and I have a touch more to finish.
The key to that extra bit is splitting the fuel tank and lightening the sensors and life support.
