I got deep below the level of the Crab Nebula (-900) in a place below the CONE Nebula. I return to the bubble and try to determine the route and determine the height of the sectors for further search. From Cubeo +- 1000Ly to Crab Nebula. Even though the search target was not found, I at least gained several hundred million exobiology credits.
