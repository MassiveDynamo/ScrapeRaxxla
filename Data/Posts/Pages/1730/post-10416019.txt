The permit lock on the fairly large (510ly radius!) NGC 2264 Sector is responsible for this gap in exploration.

Col 70 and Col 121 are about as wide, but the former is inside the Orion complex and the latter is on the way for two major touristic spots - HD 53041 (which has two black holes) and VY Canis Majoris (largest known star in the galaxy, with a solar radius of 1420). This means lots of traffic with people circumvent them at the top or bottom, while NGC 2264 presents no such incentive.
Yes, I know PIRFTL is there. But it's worth exploring. When I reach the bottom of the galaxy in this sector, I will start exploring the OOCHORRS systems below COL 70. And I will explore on a straight line of the Crab Nebula towards CUBEO (+-1000LY to Cubeo).
