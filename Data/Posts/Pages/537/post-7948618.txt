So, I haven't been keeping up in a while. Can I get a sort of run down on everything discussed in a bullet-point format or something? I would like to see the most up-to-date checklist on everything that is confirmed to be truth (such as the very few things DB ever said about Raxxla) and fake/lies/rumors (such as the "it's been honked but the guy wasn't paying attention and kept moving" myth)
