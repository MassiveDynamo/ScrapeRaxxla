I think we need to start asking Will, DB and/or any other dev who knows the truth the right question.


"Is it possible to find Raxxla as the game is now?" Because for all we know, it's in the game but the devs have not implemented a way to get to it as of yet

This is why they won't answer any questions - because as soon as they start answering, people will start finding ways to ask questions that narrow down the search criteria.
