It is 'Hearsay' but from a good source. Its a conversation with David Braben reported by Drew Wagar on one of his streams, its still live on his YT site.

its hearsay because its a 2nd hand 'confession' rather than us hearing it from DB directly so open to speculation but the quote is as accurate as DW remembers it
I'm think the bit about we know why it hasn't been found was not in Drew's quote, unless you can post a link that contradicts me? The original post was posted here a few pages back and I dont remember that last sentance being there?
