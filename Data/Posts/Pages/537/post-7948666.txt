1. It was never stated that raxxla was reachable. This was assumed and then everyone starts acting like it's a fact straight from the horses mouth.
Then we'd be wrong to assume that it's reachable now, in which case this entire thread is a waste of time

2. Regardless of it having not been confirmed by FDev, it has equally not been denied. Meaning that there hasn't been any statements either way about this. Making it northern true nor false.
If FDev were to respond to all wild speculation then they'd spend ALL their time doing it. In this particular case, confirming that the system has been visited would constitute an absolute MASSIVE clue, given that we're still (as far as I know) below 1% of systems visited

Or both true and false until someone opens the box and confirms the existing state of Schrodinger's Raxxla system
Here's another Schrodinger's Fact for you:

I've visited Raxxla and I'm not telling you where it is.

Let me know when FDev confirm or deny this.
