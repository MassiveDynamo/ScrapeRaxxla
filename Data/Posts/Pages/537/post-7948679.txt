Then we'd be wrong to assume that it's reachable now, in which case this entire thread is a waste of time


If FDev were to respond to all wild speculation then they'd spend ALL their time doing it. In this particular case, confirming that the system has been visited would constitute an absolute MASSIVE clue, given that we're still (as far as I know) below 1% of systems visited


Here's another Schrodinger's Fact for you:

I've visited Raxxla and I'm not telling you where it is.

Let me know when FDev confirm or deny this.

I thought you didn't think it was reachable currently anyway? Dont tell me I've persuaded you? Next you will be finding clues!
