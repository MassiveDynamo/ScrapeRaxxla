For the old FRifters among us DrewW’s “Salomé storyline clue list” puzzle has been solved (https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threa...ember-salome-text-cyphers.510438/post-7948192), though I still don’t understand it!

Looks like a list of all the key elements of the Salome storyline. Maybe they were the 'clues'?
