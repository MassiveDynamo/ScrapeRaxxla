So, I haven't been keeping up in a while. Can I get a sort of run down on everything discussed in a bullet-point format or something? I would like to see the most up-to-date checklist on everything that is confirmed to be truth (such as the very few things DB ever said about Raxxla) and fake/lies/rumors (such as the "it's been honked but the guy wasn't paying attention and kept moving" myth)
1) we have not found Raxxla
2) We have not been in ited to join DW
3) We have no idea what we are looking for
4) we have argued much about clues/no clues
5) I think it's in the rift and the codex has pointed us back there
6) lots of cool, but so far unfruitful intersections posted by Han Zen
7) we have not found Raxxla. I know I already mentioned this, but it is such an import6point, I thought it was worth mentioning twice
8) thread has continued to be great fun with fantastic contributions from all the usual suspects, you know who you are, so I wont name you as I'm bound to miss someone
9) I persuaded myself there could be another galaxy (fiscally feasibly)
10) I asked Will if Raxxla, TDW, Gan Romero exist, but am yet to receive a response
