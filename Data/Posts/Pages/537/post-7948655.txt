It is 'Hearsay' but from a good source. Its a conversation with David Braben reported by Drew Wagar on one of his streams, its still live on his YT site.

its hearsay because its a 2nd hand 'confession' rather than us hearing it from DB directly so open to speculation but the quote is as accurate as DW remembers it
