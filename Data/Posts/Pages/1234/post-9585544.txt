According to Mr Wagar that seems not logical. When Raxxla was first mentioned it Achenar was not even settled. So it has to be in 200ly from sol(ca 26000 stars) Mostlikely in an unhinabited system or a planet far out from it suns(futher than discovery scanner alows) or its not visible on HUD scope inside the ship.
Once again, you dont need to see/have/find Raxxla to know of its existence. It can be known from 3rd party info such as an alien artefact or communicated by aliens etc. So you can't assume just because the 1st mention is early that its in Sol and surroundings.
