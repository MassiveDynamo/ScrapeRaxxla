Once again, you dont need to see/have/find Raxxla to know of its existence. It can be known from 3rd party info such as an alien artefact or communicated by aliens etc. So you can't assume just because the 1st mention is early that its in Sol and surroundings.
Well, not had confirmation that anyone has decoded Thargoidian. Ram Tah has said nothing about Raxxla from Guardian decyphers. An alien artefact is exactly that, alien, so likely to convey little meaning other than that aliens had been there to drop it.

But there is one strange thing that I’d like answered-a tourist beacon tells us of Augustus Brenquith’s solitary search for new worlds and that he had found Ackwada since an ancient message capsule was recovered from outside the orbit of Jupiter with his data crystal that told us so. SO how did that data crystal get to Jupiter? Is there perhaps a wormhole there?

And if the fss could detect everything then we’d have found TDW station AND Raxxla by now.
P.S. and I seem to remember at least one megaship in an asteroid belt that it recently failed to find!
