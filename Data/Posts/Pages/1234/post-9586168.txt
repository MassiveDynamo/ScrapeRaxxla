We all know the saying: "Place that isn't a place, door that is also the key." The Main Menu isn't a place, you could be almost outside the Galaxy, no where near a station, and the main menu still shows you docked. The main menu is a door to the world of ED, and it is the key to open that door as well. So either the main menu is raxxla, or there are hints about where raxxla is. Either of those, or I am completely off.

Hmmm, going down that line of thinking, maybe the "personal journey" is to close the game, and Raxxla is in the real world - or is the real world!

Another option, "the place that isn't a place" is the insides of our ships. Which would make "the door" space-legs with ship interiors, and hence unreachable....
