Exactly. Until we know WHAT it is (DB quote!), and therefore how to recognise it when we find it, I will continue to follow the game lore which suggests it is close to Sol.

This is what puzzles me about the Great Raxxla Potato Hunt- they have visited a lot of systems centred on Sol, but how would they recognise if they did find it?

I suspect Raxxla can only be accessed via the Omphalos Rift, which the codex indicates is some form of tunnel.
So Raxxla likely is only instantiated when you find and enter the Omphalos tunnel. Presumably a tunnel would not show on fss scan, and may even be invisible. “Place that is not a place”?
