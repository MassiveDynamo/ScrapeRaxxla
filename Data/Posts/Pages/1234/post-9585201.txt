We always seem to have theories that end up having a already discovered system as possible location for Raxxla. EDSM gives you howmuch a system is scanned and all of those are always 100% scanned. I don't think they could be hiding something there. I think if Raxxla were to be ingame that it wouldn't be in a system that's already fully scanned on EDSM. We should either look at systems that aren't fully scanned on EDSM or not scanned for EDSM. The reason why I refer to EDSM is because there are systems that are discovered in game but not fully scanned for EDSM. Which means they still could be hiding something. But big systems like Delphi or Merope are very unlikely to still have unscanned things.
