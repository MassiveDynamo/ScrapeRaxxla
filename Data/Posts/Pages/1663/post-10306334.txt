Waiting at the heart of the galaxy, in the spaces inbetween the nothingness... An ancient construct lies hidden from view, filled with antique and sinister secrets that no man should know. It has weathered the ages as the lives of uncounted civilizations rose and fell. There is no legend so old as to give it a name, or to recall that it ever was alive; but it is told of in whispers among secret societies and raved about by soused wives home from the bar. It was of this place, that Gan Romero the mad mechanic dreamed of - on the night before he hyperspaced out of Vega singing his unexplained couplet:

"That is not dead which can eternal lie,
And with strange aeons even death may die."

or something like that I think...
