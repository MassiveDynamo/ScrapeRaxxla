Just updated my axis of Chaos hypothesis.

This hypothesis was developed independently of the various aspects named. What’s solidified it more for me was the inclusion of Olorun of the Yoruba religion.

I had been aware of the similarities for some time, highlighted by other Cmdrs, to John Miltons concept of a golden chain, but this is the first time I’ve actually looked into Olorun and its location relative to my hypothesis.

To date I believe it does go someways towards the probability that there is an axis that originates in the Underworld, granted it could still be a coincidence.
