Looks like a normal tourist installation. 3 cargo bays, one "hackable comms array", usual defensive equipment, doesn't appear to have any log uplinks at all (a lot of installation types don't)

Unfortunately as I wasn't expecting to be visiting an installation this is the ship without the manifest scanner and recon limpets, so I can't verify that those are normal.
