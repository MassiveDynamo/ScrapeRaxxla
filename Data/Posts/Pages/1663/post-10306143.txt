Care to explain what exactly was interpretational bias?
A tendency to inappropriately analyze ambiguous stimuli, scenarios and events in the negative.

At that time having an opinion that FD could have been telling porky-pies.

Thatâ€™s softened since obviously; due to obtaining a wider and better understanding, truly of the extensive work, and artistry actually undertaken by Brookes.
