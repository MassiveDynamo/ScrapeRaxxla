Just updated my axis of Chaos hypothesis. Which I now propose to be very likely true!

This hypothesis was developed independently of the various aspects named. What’s solidified it for me was the inclusion of Olorun of the Yoruba religion.

I had been aware of the similarities for some time, highlighted by other Cmdrs, to John Miltons concept of a golden chain, but this is the first time I’ve actually looked into Olorun and its location relative to my hypothesis.

To date I believe it confirms that there is an axis that originates in the Underworld, from the path of Jacques, and it likely identifies the northern pole of chaos.

Do you have a post here of the deities relating to your spatial findings?
While looking up the Yoruba mythology I found a few system names with spelling matches plus a few similar sounding names:
Babalung - similar to Babalu-Aye
Obaluaye - a Yoruba orisha with dominion over Earth and smallpox
Ayethi - derivation of Aye?
Eshu - orisha of Trickery, Crossroads, Misfortune, Chaos, Death, Travelers, Messenger
Oyas - Oya is the orisha of Storms, Wind, Thunder, Lightning, Dead

as well as another solar deity - Yhi - female creator spirit and personification of the sun
