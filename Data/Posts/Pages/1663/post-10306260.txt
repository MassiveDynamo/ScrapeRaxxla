I could be wrong here but I believe megaships act like orbital installations in that you must data-link scan to see interactable parts.
Correct.

Some megaships also function as taxi services; you can dock at them and be transported to other systems.

The itinerary/destination(s) is listed in the "Local News" portion of the station menu.
-for non-taxi megaships, the initerary can be found by scanning "Ship Log Uplink".
