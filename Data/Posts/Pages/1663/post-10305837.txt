Yes, these were added later. One such example was the ‘Silver Comet’ mystery.

Originally when you found the location there wasn’t anything really there, just a POI instance with a couple of elite ships which tried to kill you; now there’s a structure there which adds to the fun and basically acts like a sign post that ‘somethings there’, places to hide, dodge etc. The site itself doesn’t do anything.

These little mysteries were in game from launch and promoted via the old Gal Net and localised Station news…
