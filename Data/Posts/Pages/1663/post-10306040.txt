The Silver Comet (a mystery location previously linked to a Galnet story) is actually an amusing example of interpretational bias / poor communication.

It was like other various backer’s fictions - published at launch, included in game as a findable element.

What’s now amusing is when I first started investigating Raxxla, I first looked to this story to test my assumptions as to what was/wasn't in game, due to a rather large chip of incredulous disbelief. My thoughts being if this was in game then maybe it was worth finding Raxxla (at the time I wasn’t particularly receptive to DB statements and took everything he said with a brick of salt).

The mystery was rather simple, but technically was placed between two locations. At that time, going to the first location resolved in nothing for me, so I opted for the second, which seemed more logical, it being locked behind a very grindy permit. Long story short it was the wrong system, but I got rather rich from the endeavour, and learnt that (at that time) FD mysteries were actually very basic.

Cautionary tale - try not to overthink things.
