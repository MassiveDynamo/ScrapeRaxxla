Just a heads up: there may be more to all those various firmware, security patches, and various encryption related data types. I legitimately believe some of the comms arrays and ship logs actually require specific types of data to access.

A defence in depth uses multi-layered protections, similar to redundant protections, to create a reliable system despite any one layer's unreliability.

Let's just say that there is a very good possibility not all is as it seems.

Coorespondingly, the shadow of darkness is not more darkness but light.
One cannot have light without a lot of darkness.
