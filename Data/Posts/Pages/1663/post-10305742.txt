They all got added with 2.3 alongside the megaships (and the various hatchbreaking / datalink gameplay around them). As with megaships, they got a bit more work in 3.3 with the BGS changes to add scenarios taking place at them, to make them a bit more interactive.

I'm just thinking of those types as "most likely to be mysterious" but really anything of them nowhere near a tourist spot or obviously inhabited system would be pretty weird.
As we've all said at some point before too, it's entirely possible that clues or info relating to Raxxla was added as more features were added to make use of newly available gameplay systems. These types of locations are prime candidates for clues, as you say!
