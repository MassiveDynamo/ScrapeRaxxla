You can search for bodies (e.g. BH) and specify a reference system (choose one in the approximate centre of your desired search area from the Galmap)-either EDDB/Bodies or Spansh/Bodies search will do this, but then youâ€™ll have to go through and check them manually.
So does a search using the above only show ones that have discovered? Or is it a search of all the systems in game?
