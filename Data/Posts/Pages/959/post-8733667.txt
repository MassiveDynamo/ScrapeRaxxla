So does a search using the above only show ones that have discovered? Or is it a search of all the systems in game?
Such DB does not exists. Systems are created on 1st visit by commander, so even FDevs dunno. Next commander MUST upload his log to edsm.
I use EDCM + "no red" plugin. It shows me plenty of known but never uploaded systems 300ly from bubble.
