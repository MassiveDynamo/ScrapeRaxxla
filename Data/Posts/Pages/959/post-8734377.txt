Argonautica-based hypothesis & testing

I liked this hypothesis since Jason Ryder (father of Alex) was the original searcher for Raxxla & was killed at start of Holdstock’s TDW. In Greek mythology Jason & the Argonauts were searching for the Golden Fleece.

I like where this is headed! A locus of 6 points with a centroid as the target.

Perhaps the Raxxla symbol of a central star ☉, with 3 asteroid belts, and 33 (?) planetary bodies could be something to keep an eye out for.

I searched eddb for those systems you listed but none seem to have those characteristics.
