How many, if any, are near the Coal Sack Nebula / or Alpha Crucis? - I think the idea of Raxxla (the station) was inspired by "Murcheson's Eye" - or The Mote in God's Eye

You can search for bodies (e.g. BH) and specify a reference system (choose one in the approximate centre of your desired search area from the Galmap)-either EDDB/Bodies or Spansh/Bodies search will do this, but then youâ€™ll have to go through and check them manually.
