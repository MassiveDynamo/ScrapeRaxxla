But it would be damn useful!!!!!
Edit: are those nearby systems downloaded from Stellar Forge during the witchspace transition / loading window?

Pure guess taken from the time it takes some systems to load, especially in the black, especially if undiscovered but not essential, the time taken can compare to the resolution of bio & geo signals - and we know thats SF generation - Id guess not. Pure anecdotal. Logic suggests no as a lot of useless data a lot of the time. But no real idea.

Can we check if it is against TOS coz we all want one now Surely theres a way to pull it of EDSM or does that only 'know about' stars that have been logged there?
