Mmm, following up on my last post, Raxxla is a story to be played out in-game. So where is the storyline? What is the plot? Who are the characters? (Us I guess-I want credits and a paycheque!!! Lavian brandy is still expensive after Hadrian’s funeral demand!).

A thought occured yesterday while trying to complete testing on my Argonautica hypothesis (will report soon)- I seem to remember DB saying something like “it could be found by a single player but it’s more likely to be found by a wing” & I think that was about Raxxla. Does anyone have this reference? It might also be referring to TDW station? In either case it seems to me to imply something about instancing and the possibility of finding the solution. I’ve been looking around Type3 GG and moons/planets of M type stars as per the AHTW CIEP station description and TDW Codex pic. But if it’s an instancing thing we might have to be very lucky to get to it, like the comet in some system I remember (was it Lave?).

Edit: or am I confusing myself & it was DW said that about the FRift??
