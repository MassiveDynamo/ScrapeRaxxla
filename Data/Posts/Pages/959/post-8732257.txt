Pretty sure MB said FD had contemplated a sequel to AHTW (possibly TDW), but instead decided Raxxla should be played out in the game.

Ah yes: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/elite-legacy.50320/post-2566545

Edit: twas Legacy- - -

CrazyPea “Don't get me wrong Legacy was an excellent book - the 2nd half especially, had me gripped to the end. Since Legacy was billed in the Kickstarter campaign as a sequel to The Dark Wheel, however, I was expecting more of a direct follow up - perhaps the adventures of a descendant of Alex and Elyssia, or Freeholm being the remains of the mysterious planet Raxxla and Laphria/The Empire wanting it for the alien technology still hidden there. I definitely wanted to see the Dark Wheel themselves involved somewhere along the line. There was a throwaway reference to Raxxla near the beginning the story but...”

MB “It was more of a spiritual successor than a direct sequel. We did look at a story involving Raxxla, but felt that was a story that should be played out in game rather than as a novel.
