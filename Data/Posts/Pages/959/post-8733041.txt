Greetings Commanders,

I gave the Wolf-Rayets another try (spiralling stars..) by checking the names of known WRs (http://pacrowther.staff.shef.ac.uk/WRcat/) within EDSM.
Maybe there is a WR which is still unknown..
The first list contained 433 systems with multiple names, resulting in more than 900 system names. (sic)
1st check was EDSM. Then I checked every unknown system manually in-game.
Then I reduced all duplicates and noted the "main" system name which is used in the galaxy map. (e.g. most HIPs are visible as HD in the galaxy map)
The final list of "known" WRs containes 48 systems and ONE was not within EDSM. -> MERILL'S STAR
->Did the 15kly trip .. but again, no joy. It has already been visited and scanned.

Here is a list of the final WRs which I found using the website above.
Note that some of the systems are not tagged as WRs in ED. Sometimes its a Blue-Giant or a Blue-White.
Interesting systems are Cygni-X3 and V429 Carinae as they are only reachable using FCs, I suppose.

So if anyone is interested in the WR list:

AG Carinae
ALS 299
Apep
CD-57 312
Cygni X-3
Gamma Velorum

I have an interest in WR stars in-game, since FD, and DB in particular, claim to be keen on realistic science. However WR are huge stars and exceedingly bright. IRL there are, I think, none nearer than Gamma Valorum (the hypothesised home of the Guardians), that’s a naked eye object at around 1300ly, so why is LAWD26 a WR at only around 26 ly from Sol? Guess it would be brighter than the Sun!?
