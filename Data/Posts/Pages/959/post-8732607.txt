Drew said something, in responses to Qs about FR:

Q - Can a single player find the secret? (may have been can a single player or will it need a wing / group?)
A - Depends who goes looking

Q - Something about brute forcing the area / region (iirc)?
A - Something like may help but some caveat, maybe something about a wing searching quicker.... (not great I know and may be totally inaccurate)

A full wing can search 4x faster / easier, so theoretically they can find it quicker...if theyre in the right system.

'Story played out in game' - this is my worst fear, that it will be a story with a start and end and then thats it. End of search / mystery. I prefer it to just be out there, somewhere, with no clues and no story and no worries if nobody finds it, just means the legend lives on.
