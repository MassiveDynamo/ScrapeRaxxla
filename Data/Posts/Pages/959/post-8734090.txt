When someone goes to their ingame nav panel, there is a list of “nearby” stars to select as an FSD jump destination. Someone could write a plugin to scrape that list and show only the stars not in EDSM or previously visited. But that’s probably against the ToS.

Probably!
But it would be damn useful!!!!!
Edit: are those nearby systems downloaded from Stellar Forge during the witchspace transition / loading window?
