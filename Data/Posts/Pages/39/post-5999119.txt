FDev never said this would be easy
Even as an enemy of the Pilot's Federation there are two other stations in that system which are controlled by the DW. Yes they are planet-based, so you could argue that this would lock it out from Mac users and therefore it cannot be anything to do with Raxxla. Or we could try it and see?

Alternatively try and get the DW to usurp the PFed in Shin-Dezh and take control of Jameson Memorial. That would an interesting BGS war

It would lock it out to non-Horizons owners as well - that said we have no indication that Raxxla would be accessible to owners of only the basic game without expansions.

I think someone did try the BGS with the Dark Wheel at Shinrarta at some point (can't remember who now, a year or two ago) and they did not have much luck as I recall.
