It seems there is a recent (7 September) no-answer answer from one of the live streams, number 6 here.

Current speculation on the thread linked off of AndyJ's post above seems to be that all "Founder or Elite" missions were removed when they removed rank requirements from the mission system. It would be nice to have that confirmed, and know whether they will come back. And if their absence might be inhibiting or preventing finding Raxxla (or anything else) in any way.

I bet they have the entire storyline idle because of this bug. Just like when the EAFOTS bases were unlandable. History repeats and now FD keep silent to avoid salt.
Seriously, ' We have nothing to announce at this point '.... What kind of an arrogant answer is that ? Don't ask and play the breadcrumbs we give you!
