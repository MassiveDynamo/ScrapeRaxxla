I think the particular missions under discussion here are those for Elite pilots from the Dark Wheel faction and are only available in Shinrarta Dehzra, which is permit-locked & you need to be Elite in at least one discipline to get the permit.

Elite or Founder. And I believe they were available elsewhere at one point, although that changed with various updates. See Macros' link to AndyJ's summary upstream.
