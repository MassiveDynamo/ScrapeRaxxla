I dont think that missions will give us a link to Raxxla. That would be a clue, when the mission is read. I dont think you will feel you are "hot on the trail" when it is found.
I think it will be a combination of dumb luck and reaching for the hardest planet to get to. In the middle of nowhere, and a system you would need a higher jump range than an un-engineered conda.
Ive been toying with looking around the outside of the galaxy and seeing if there is anything I can find that really tough to get to. Or perhaps the area between the Centaurus reach and the Persius arm.
