Has anyone tried to get extreme negative rep with a faction(s) in Shinrarta Dezhra to see if that triggers the scripted dw missions? Maybe enemy of the Pilots Federation?

Not sure how feasible that would be if it is the faction controlling the station. You'd just be vaporized every time you tried to dock? I think Pilot's Fed are still in control?
