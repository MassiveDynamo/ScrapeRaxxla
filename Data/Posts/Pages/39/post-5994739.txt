If Raxxla still existed the Thargoids would never even be in our space. Something catastrophic must have happened to their world.
If that is the case, shouldn't mean we can't still find it (or what is left of it) though. Not even sure there is a Thargoid connection to Raxxla, isn't the gateway(s) to other universes there just referred to as being "alien"?

I believe Soontill is the only planet with a canon connection to Thargoids (from And Here the Wheel). Assuming that is still canon of course. And the station at Peregrina (from Out of the Darkness). Oh, and Polaris I guess too, although even that has a big question mark over it with the canon overhaul.

Perhaps the technology on Raxxla was Guardian in nature - "guarding" access to the other universes or perhaps their home universe via the gateways.
