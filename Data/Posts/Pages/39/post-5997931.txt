I just reported the first post and asked to move the thread, so that we can go on asking about the missions (or is there a new one?).

I'm quite new to Elite and would love to play the missions (and participate in finding Raxxla).

I think the particular missions under discussion here are those for Elite pilots from the Dark Wheel faction and are only available in Shinrarta Dehzra, which is permit-locked & you need to be Elite in at least one discipline to get the permit.
