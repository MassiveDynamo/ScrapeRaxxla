I've read it twice (good book!).
Me too! Part way through third time reading to make sure I've not missed anything. Great story, I'd like to see more FFE from John Harper.

I agree that Soontill and Raxxla are separate things. John wanted to write the story of Raxxla (like everyone!) but couldn't, so AFAIK he changed Raxxla to Soontill, the DW to CIEP, and the rest of the story pretty much stayed as he originally envisioned it (apart from FDev's great red pen of doom!).
