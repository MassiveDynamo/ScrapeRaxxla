Anyone else who's interested in getting an answer, well please do add your voice into this thread:

I just reported the first post and asked to move the thread, so that we can go on asking about the missions (or is there a new one?).

I'm quite new to Elite and would love to play the missions (and participate in finding Raxxla).
