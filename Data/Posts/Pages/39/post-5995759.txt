It seems there is a recent (7 September) no-answer answer from one of the live streams, number 6 here.

Yes, it was me that asked the question in the livestream ("Because I could")

I followed it up on the next one a fortnight later to ask Paige what "nothing to talk about" meant (as got no response on that thread) but unfortunately had to go answer the door just as I got a reply - I think I caught "nothing to announce right now" as the answer as it scrolled off the screen but it was gone by the time I got back. (Better half's fault!)

Current speculation on the thread linked off of AndyJ's post above seems to be that all "Founder or Elite" missions were removed when they removed rank requirements from the mission system. It would be nice to have that confirmed, and know whether they will come back. And if their absence might be inhibiting or preventing finding Raxxla (or anything else) in any way.

Feel free to have a go asking. I've been asking since before v2.0 dropped and I'm pretty fed up with it all now tbh.
