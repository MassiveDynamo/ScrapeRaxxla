Not sure how feasible that would be if it is the faction controlling the station. You'd just be vaporized every time you tried to dock? I think Pilot's Fed are still in control?
FDev never said this would be easy
Even as an enemy of the Pilot's Federation there are two other stations in that system which are controlled by the DW. Yes they are planet-based, so you could argue that this would lock it out from Mac users and therefore it cannot be anything to do with Raxxla. Or we could try it and see?

Alternatively try and get the DW to usurp the PFed in Shin-Dezh and take control of Jameson Memorial. That would an interesting BGS war
