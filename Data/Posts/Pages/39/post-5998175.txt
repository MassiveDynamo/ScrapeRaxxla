I think the particular missions under discussion here are those for Elite pilots from the Dark Wheel faction and are only available in Shinrarta Dehzra, which is permit-locked & you need to be Elite in at least one discipline to get the permit.
Thanks, I've read about that. New to a Elite is a bit relative I started end of June and am quite close to become an Elite Explorer (had a trip Bubble -> Colonia -> SagA -> Bubble).
