Why not?

I wouldn't say I believe this but I certainly wouldn't rule it out whatsoever. Think about some of the engineers. We have a Jameson, a Ryder, Felicity Farseer. I would assume it's obvious that Liz Ryder is a member. I also wouldn't bat an eyelash to find out Lori Jameson was a member too and Farseer definitely knows something she isn't telling. Not to mention the rest. They are all essentially the best of the best at what they do.

But I think ruling something out completely without verifiable proof of the contrary is a very bad idea
We’re told in the codex that DW membership often runs in families. We know Ryder Sr was one member, from the original novella and Alex was going to attain membership in his search for Raxxla (I suspect that TDW do know where &/or what it is and the statement to the contrary is obfuscation!). So Liz Ryder is a good candidate for DW membership. But what is the evidence for any of the other engineers? Apart from Felicity which I’ve addressed in yesterday’s post. Elvira & Bill almost certainly aren’t DW members (Elite Premonition). Don’t think I’ve seen any hints for any of the others.
