I thought this too but recently after the Liz Ryder affair they all got together and agreed to be more useful to the Cmdrs so not sure they are as disconnected as they appear. And certainly implies they all have the same goal in mind.

Some are Club (Elvira & Turner iirc), some or at least one should be DW really, some may be independent or have another alliance, but it may be being overwritten or cast aside as we speak. Wouldnt be the first time established lore took a back seat to a storyline or new idea.

I know Drew wrote the Elvira in-game text, and some other authors wrote some of the others, but I dont know when.
According to premonition all the engineers are to some extent backed by the Club.

As Infrastructure says: ‘What do you think all this was about? The clandestine technology acquisition aimed at ensuring that necessary advances took place according to a certain timetable, fanning the flames of war between the Federation and the Empire to ensure humanity has a fleet that has a chance in the coming battle. The encouragement of the space-faring masses to grow their skills in the Arena and weaponise their ships courtesy of those oh-so-convenient “Engineers.” We don’t intend to allow humanity to be cannon fodder in someone else’s war.'
