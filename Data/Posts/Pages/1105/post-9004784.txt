We’re told in the codex that DW membership often runs in families. We know Ryder Sr was one member, from the original novella and Alex was going to attain membership in his search for Raxxla (I suspect that TDW do know where &/or what it is and the statement to the contrary is obfuscation!). So Liz Ryder is a good candidate for DW membership. But what is the evidence for any of the other engineers? Apart from Felicity which I’ve addressed in yesterday’s post. Elvira & Bill almost certainly aren’t DW members (Elite Premonition). Don’t think I’ve seen any hints for any of the others.
Hmm, syndicate known as the Blue Mafia...
