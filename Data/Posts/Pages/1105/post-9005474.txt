I felt that Robert Garry being direct descendant and heir to TDW and actively going against CIEP indicated the difference between the two after the schism
And if that is the case, maybe we should be looking for TDW (and Raxxla clues) on Garry's home world, or the pirate asteroid base from the book where he ends up IIRC (forget the names). If it is canon - which we don't know anymore.
