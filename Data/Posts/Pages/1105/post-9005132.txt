We were not allowed to talk about Raxxla at all (other than referencing it as a mystery). Thargoids were in-scope if you wanted to play with them in a limited fashion (I didn't initially, but T.James made it the focal point of his book - "Out of the darkness" and I did include them in Premonition).

Anti-gravity was just a rule (a rather silly one to my way of thinking) and there was no negotiation on this being a staple of the ED universe (One of DBs stipulations). Time-travel wasn't even discussed.... nobody intended to use that mechanic in an ED story as I recall.

Cheers,

Drew.

Thanks Drew, good to get clarification!

I guess, with DB’s emphasis on scientific accuracy (@3:30 mins

) he’s personally not fond of antigravity, though I still want to know how Thargoids suck up barnacle products, together with adjacent SRVs, rocks etc, on airless worlds!!
