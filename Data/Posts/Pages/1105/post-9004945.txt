Cyclops 5 NHSS.
5 It can also be empty or with scouts, but this is rare.
There is a thread on the forum about it, it is active and I think the author is happy to accept this experiment, if he did not do it.
Thanks - I found the wiki too with the rundown of each of the NHSS also. Lots of changes since last time I was around Thargoids .
