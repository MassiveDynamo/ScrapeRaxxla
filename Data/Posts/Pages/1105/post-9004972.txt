We were not allowed to talk about Raxxla at all (other than referencing it as a mystery). Thargoids were in-scope if you wanted to play with them in a limited fashion (I didn't initially, but T.James made it the focal point of his book - "Out of the darkness" and I did include them in Premonition).

Anti-gravity was just a rule (a rather silly one to my way of thinking) and there was no negotiation on this being a staple of the ED universe (One of DBs stipulations). Time-travel wasn't even discussed.... nobody intended to use that mechanic in an ED story as I recall.

Cheers,

Hey Drew,

It’s come up before, but just wondering if you could clarify - was it specifically no anti-gravity that was the rule or was it no artificial gravity (except via acceleration)?

I posted a quote from DB which covers the artificial gravity situation for ED, but am just wondering if the writers got told that and also got told no anti-gravity, or if there was a conflation of the two.

(I’m sure there’s an MB comment on Time Travel somewhere, but it’s interesting that no Time Travel wasn’t stipulated to the writers.)
