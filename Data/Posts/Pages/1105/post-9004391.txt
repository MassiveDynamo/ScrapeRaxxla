So, a bit of an experiment en route. Dropped into a Threat 4 Thargoid signal with a Soontill relic in my hold. Was immediately attacked, no scan, no warning, no nothing, as soon as I dropped in, by a Thargoid Marauder. There was another Thargoid present also but I didn't even get a chance to see what it was before I frameshifted out with no shields left. Hypothesis - Soontlll Relics are Guardian? Unless your run of the mill Xeno Scanner, which I never even got a chance to use, counts as Guardian tech? Or are some of them now attacking instantly without scans and such?
