I thought this too but recently after the Liz Ryder affair they all got together and agreed to be more useful to the Cmdrs so not sure they are as disconnected as they appear. And certainly implies they all have the same goal in mind.

Some are Club (Elvira & Turner iirc), some or at least one should be DW really, some may be independent or have another alliance, but it may be being overwritten or cast aside as we speak. Wouldnt be the first time established lore took a back seat to a storyline or new idea.

I know Drew wrote the Elvira in-game text, and some other authors wrote some of the others, but I dont know when.
This might fit with the hypothesis that FD have access to rep counters which the player base donâ€™t see, until something happens (like the PilotsFederation rep for rescues and killing goids).
