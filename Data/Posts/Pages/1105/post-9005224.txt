Just because the Club back/support or even setup engineers doesn't necessarily mean the engineers are aware of let alone part of the Club. Similarly, in And Here The Wheel it was the Circle of Elite Independent Pilots who were trying to provoke the war between the Feds and the Empire for the reasons stated in the quote above, so does that mean that they have been retconned out, or were they just being manipulated, or doing it with full knowledge that they were working for the Club? Maybe TDW in Shinrarta are a front for the Club to keep people from finding the real DW, and to know who is looking for them? I don't think there are any definitive answers to any of this, and we just end up chasing our canonical or non-canonical tails.
