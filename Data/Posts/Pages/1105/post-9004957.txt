The authors were told to stay away from the topics of Raxxla, Thargoids, anti-gravity and (I think) time travel but not 100% sure about the last one.

We were not allowed to talk about Raxxla at all (other than referencing it as a mystery). Thargoids were in-scope if you wanted to play with them in a limited fashion (I didn't initially, but T.James made it the focal point of his book - "Out of the darkness" and I did include them in Premonition).

Anti-gravity was just a rule (a rather silly one to my way of thinking) and there was no negotiation on this being a staple of the ED universe (One of DBs stipulations). Time-travel wasn't even discussed.... nobody intended to use that mechanic in an ED story as I recall.

Cheers,

Drew.
