) heâ€™s personally not fond of antigravity, though I still want to know how Thargoids suck up barnacle products, together with adjacent SRVs, rocks etc, on airless worlds!!
A 'force field' type thing is already in place in the Mailslots. not sure what the lore or explanation is but 'light' is used to create a permeable solid barrier, ships can pass though but Oxygen cant? so maybe its a similar thing, create a 'field' and make it not a vacuum so can hoover it up

Or maybe some sort of 'magnetism' type force that attracts everything? Dunno just guessing.

According to premonition all the engineers are to some extent backed by the Club.
Which begs the question, who are the Club exactly?

DW used to be the 'good guys' - bad guys unspecified just some shadowy cabal.

Club - I thought were the 'bad guys' and DW was still the 'good guys'. Unless some DW have infiltrated.

I just have a problem with Lori Jameson especially being Club and not DW, the others I can let go but not a Jameson, not unless shes a spy for DW. (If Club is bad that is and DW is good).

Is there a definitive answer or dont we actually know yet?
