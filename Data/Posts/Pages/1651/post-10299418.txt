Thank you for this. It was difficult jumping between different sources comparing the text

Edit: The Codex KB discrepancy is definitely odd.
Was it a clumsy attempt to tie the player actions to lore events? or as you say it could be an deliberate misrepresentation by the PF to distract from continuing the search for clues.

This just further reinforces the need to bring about more answers to the Guardian mystery, because in the attempt to neatly wrap it up, they've highlighted the dissonance between Halsey's words and Official PF records.

Edit 2: If Halsey received these visions while drifting away from the SSO wreckage, maybe it's a good locality to do a thorough search. Study the systems publicly announced on the Tour, then within the systems around Saga and Azaleach listen and scan for anything unusual.
