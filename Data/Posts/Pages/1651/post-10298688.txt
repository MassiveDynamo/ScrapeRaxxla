I sort of struggle sometimes with the Landscape signal/Sag A* being Raxxla... unless the reason no one found it was because they couldn't get there...

And they would have worked out the signal just like we did in game pretty quickly, so why were people heading off searching for Raxxla...

And why doesn't the Siren song affect everyone as we all hear it....

There's the logical reasoning that it can't be too far from Sol or the Old Worlds due to technology restrictions....

Just a thought

So I have a counter proposal to the landscape signal question. First off, lets be clear that there really isn't any such thing as sound in space since sound energy requires a medium of matter to disturb. Therefore, sound can't actually travel in a vacuum. Putting these minor details aside, one could propose that the game may be using the signal as a way to point us to a clue, but is not in and of itself the clue.

What if we are asking the wrong question when we try to pinpoint its exact spot and go there? What if the question is "where is the signal being sent TO?" Perhaps it's origin is simply near the galactic core so everyone in the galaxy can notice it or pick it up? Imagine if the signal could be mapped by amplitude and it was mapped to look like a cone expanding outward. The question I would have is, where is the center line of the cone and what is it going to? Is it going to the formadine rift and creating a cross with the other formadine rift direction clue? If so does that intersection land on a key system relating to Raxxla?
