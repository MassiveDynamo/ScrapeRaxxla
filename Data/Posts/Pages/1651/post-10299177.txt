Mmm yes.

I wanted to plot out the course for SSO, to see where it ‘went’ prior to its destruction, this might have given us some indication of influence.

However, although many of the systems in the tour are named, their ‘order’ is not actually implicit so in my opinion they likely are irrelevant.

I’ll have to re-read Galnet in order to get this straight in my mind, but it does seem many of these systems weren’t visited, so some may be irrelevant / some not.

I recall looking at this a long time ago but discarding it as not having enough information to interest me; that was before I started making star maps.

With that in mind I can now see it may have some relevance, and I do wonder if this was an intentional directional clue (played outside the game) to point us to something linked to Raxxla or a general area - it may not of course!

I’ll do some more digging…
