Starship One incident
HIP 53688, Tinia, Aleumoxii, 78 Ursae Majoris, Dietri, Su, Furuhjelm I-645, Saga, Delphin, Nanomam, Coriccha, and Ross 860, then lost between Azaleach system, and the scheduled arrival destination in the Saga system. Then Leoniceno Orbital, where was the actual wreckage found, I canâ€™t identify that?
The 2nd CG "The Search for Survivors of Starship One" asked for players to search the Lyncis Sector systems:
"Pilots who want to contribute to the search should concentrate their efforts in the Lyncis Sector, and in particular on the
Lyncis Sector ON-T B3-1,
Lyncis Sector ON-T B3-2,
Lyncis Sector ON-T B3-3,
Lyncis Sector ON-T B3-4 and
Lyncis Sector ST-R B4-3 1 systems, where we believe further wreckage from the ship may be found."
Edit: found the last known trajectory systems from the initial search CG:
Niju
Hip 36014
Xbal
HR 2485
Lyncis Sector ON-T B3-1
Lyncis Sector ON-T B3-2
Lyncis Sector ON-T B3-3
