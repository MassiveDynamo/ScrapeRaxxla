I need some supporting information; is the following list of destinations for Starship One in the correct sequential order, if not what was it originally?

Starship One incident
HIP 53688, Tinia, Aleumoxii, 78 Ursae Majoris, Dietri, Su, Furuhjelm I-645, Saga, Delphin, Nanomam, Coriccha, and Ross 860, then lost between Azaleach system, and the scheduled arrival destination in the Saga system.
