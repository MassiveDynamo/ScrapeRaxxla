The following systems announced as part of the tour - note there is no indication this is in any order, identification that a dozen other systems will also be visited, but not declared due to security reasons, so logically we don’t initially know which order they might have been in?

09 MAY 3301

Just had a check in my notes but looks like I deleted the one on the SSO disaster.
I did find "Halsey has a sister Azalea" (hint to something about Azaleach?? In Japan/China Azaleas symbolise homesickness, is that the opposite of Fernweh??)
IIRC the Post that revealed a secret meeting of Halsey and Mahon was removed from Galnet. We only knew about it because someone had taken a screenshot before the deletion.
