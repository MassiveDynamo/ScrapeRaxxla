So I do not think that aspect relates to Raxxla.

Halsey Met with Mahon shortly before changing course on her final tour. I would not rule out her detour being motivated by an intent to investigate a Raxxla lead. If so, Mahon would also have that information, though his head remains conspicuously on top of his shoulders (assuming he hasn't been kidnapped and replaced with a duplicate - if the Emeperor can disappear for a year, so can anyone... ).

Last time I was on I logged off in the Hazel system, on a station in orbit of the Earth-like World Grove. I need to have another look at the tree-rune systems... .

I thought the SSO detour and meeting with Mason had been retconned out? It's a long while ago but I remember the discussion, though might not have been in this thread. Think @simulacrae posted about it...
