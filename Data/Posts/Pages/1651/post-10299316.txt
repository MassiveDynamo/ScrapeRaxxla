Starship One timeline

6 MAY 3301
The following systems announced as part of the tour - note there is no indication this is in any order, identification that a dozen other systems will also be visited, but not declared due to security reasons, so logically we don’t initially know which order they might have been in?

Hip 53688; Tinia; 78 Ursae Majoris; Su; Furuhjlem I-645; Saga; Delphin; Nanoman; Coriccha; Ross 860

09 MAY 3301
Announcement President Halsey to visit system of 78 Ursae Majoris. But this is only a statement, not a date of arrival.

13 May 3301
President Halsey starts tour from Sol. Again the same systems are named but it’s not confirmed if there is a definitive order to them?

15 May 3301
78 Ursae Majoris begin preparations for Halsey arrival. But no arrival date is announced.

25 May 3301
Halsey arrived in 78 Ursae Majoris, a private discussion was held between Halsey and Mahon but no indication about what. It was then stated Halsey was to continue onto the system Saga.

26 May 3301
Halsey does not arrive in Saga as planned. Then confirmed to have taken an unscheduled detour to Azaleach.

27 May 3301
Halsey declared missing but no indication of where she might have gone. However at the end of the post a search and rescue team is assembled in Azaleach.

So the projected route is: Sol to 78 Ursae Majoris. Then 78 Ursae Majoris to Azaleach.
