Othon, you mentioned that you went about your search as one who did not "have blood on his hands".

I know the Eleusian mysteries were open to all, but that one of the requirements of initiation was that the novitiate had never murdered or have "blood on their hands".

This would lead me to surmise that the path to be followed would have to be from one who had never killed a ship or entity in game, though the contradictory point to that is that there appears to be an assassination mission given at the first hurdle - I find it interesting that you said you had "both completed it and failed it", which suggests you tried to keep your hands clean somehow.

I can't help thinking that this requirement is somehow key, though how this fits in with the raison d'etre of the game as a whole, I cannot yet fathom...
