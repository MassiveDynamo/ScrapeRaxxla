Haven’t fleshed out this idea yet because if it’s connected together I’m not quite sure how. But I think most, like myself, suspect Delphi is connected to Raxxla (with good reason). There doesn’t appear, to me, to be anything within the system to help us find anything outside of it (other than perhaps coordnance from the Thargoid base). If we consider the Delphi system iteself to be the center from which to view things, I’m curious what the Cassiopeia constellation looks like from the point of view of Delphi. I think, as others have said, that the mother of galaxies is referencing Cassiopeia, the parents greif and the lovers woe, I think is the Andromeda constellation (parents had to sacrifice her and her lover saved her). I wonder if viewing these two from Delphi might give us some hints. I also think it’s interesting that the first account of Raxxla was recorded in Tau Ceti, which forms the literal belly of the beast, Cetus (constellation), the sea monster sent by Poseidon to kill Andromeda.
