It does not say that you cannot kill, you cannot murder it says. Meaning that if for some good reason you did (like wanted status, wars) it does not count. In greek times I cannot imagine that there would be no blood on anyone's hands. For example, you being a judge deciding on execution. Murder is what pirates would do. A criminal act for personal gain only. I am really sure that in the 4y I have played this game not once I did such an act.
