I've been wondering what that could mean.(the circle in raxxla.) BTW, the back image seems to be related to the back of a station interior. The 3 part circumferences are and upside down reticule on the system map or something seen in the front of the interior of a station potentially. The only part I have not found a very blunt equivilant too is the hexagon with 18 dashes. Stations have 18 dashes in some stations with red rear interiors but it's in a circle.

And as to not killing. Do you have to have no combat kill experience. I've wondered this. Because there is an oddity related to combat for explroreres. The only way to max jump range in an anaconda is to get dangerous in combat for the jamison engineer. I was going to do pure exploration but I would need to get that level in combat somehow to get max range. it's weird. I've been wondering if there was a way around this. Or a way to get to dangerous without actually engaging in combat. Like if there is a way to get trader up with side things like exploration(which sadly doesn't happen).

Jameson is the only one to offer level 4 lightweight on life support and here access is exclusively from combat rank. the only alternative is a lv 3 from Bill Turner:

Oddly enough lori requires access from marco who lives in sirius and is an odd character who is set aside by the company to do work almost like someone in a company who purposely does this to run things from the side in a hidden manner. He also lives on a planet called Lucifer... You would think lori being a jameson would be explorer oriented and not combat.
