The Ysidril Tree, right? Seems clue like to me, and to many others.

So after a tip earlier in this thread, I have been reading "Islands in the Sky: The Four-Dimensional Journey of Odysseus through Space and Time"

Might have to have a few reads of it to fully understand but....

mythological trees of life?
omphalos?
navel?
pleiades?
pole star (current, previous, next and a certain constellation as an alternative to a pole star)?
And many other words that made me tinfoil....

just a thought


SPOILER: IT'S LONG!
