I suspect FD wouldn’t use something like that, they might be laying themselves open to copyright infringement etc.
I couldn’t understand the belter patois in the show & gave up on it. Did read the books, but didn’t enjoy the last one.

Theres a time in life where you just have to accept....subtitles....we are not getting old, they are muttering and mumbling and talking slang and patois and strong accents

well the dark wheel did expand from shinrata to LFT 926. back in the days, it was exclusively present in shinrata alone if im not mistaken. was the expansion influenced by players or not? i dont know. but if it was, then it should be able to be expanded again.

Mmm -we’ve considered Milton, Greek myth, Roman myth, Homer, ancient Irish barrow sites, .............
But we haven’t actually tried Lord of The Rings!
Click to expand...

There’s a Cambridge dictionary????

Youve done it now. frontier just turned up NPC interdictions and gave them grom bombs just for you

Overall - problem is there is a lot of sci-fi and fantasy reference in game, either player named or frontier homage to it. 2001, Red Dwarf, Terry Pratchett, THGTTG, Lovecroft and loads more so its hard to know whats what and whats meant to be myth. Its mind boggingly big and complex.
