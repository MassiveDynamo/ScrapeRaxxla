Correct the word seems key to me. Isn't brow also the thing used to connect a ship to its port?



Mmm, wiktionary has a few definitions for brow that are new to me
The first tine of an antler's beam
The gangway from ship to shore when a ship is lying alongside a quay
The hinged part of a landing craft or ferry which is lowered to form a landing platform; a ramp.

So, are we looking for a deer with a jewel hanging on the first tine of its antlers? Must be greek mythology!
