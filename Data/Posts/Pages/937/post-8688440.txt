You should see the 'Remember Salome' thread. 2 flipping years it took to solve and 99.9% of it was overthinking, asking the ancient Greeks, looking at the stars, just about everything but the thing we were supposed to do.
Yeah I remember it. Wasn't part of the thread but joined late towards the end. It's interesting seeing drew talk about it. Him thinking it would be solved way before it did. There only being an anaconda originally. I sometimes think of what I'd do if someone found it and offered me the location. Would I really want it solved for me. I know it's cheese but this thread is like far out listening post with theories and jokes passing through each day. Human beings coming together and laying out theories that are emboldened by their imagination and take on the world. It's an amazing thing. All taken a turn round the campfire to tell the story of our own raxxla. Am sorry that was cheese. But what if we subconsciously sabotage ourselves to stop the end from creeping in. The void swallowing our candle in the darkness. Haha so dramatic.
