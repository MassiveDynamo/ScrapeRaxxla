Ah someone said it’s important to know what you know (awareness) and know what you don’t know (wisdom).
Its not knowing what you know (amnesia/senility) and not knowing what you don’t know (Questing) that gets you.
Its just that everytime history gets edited i don't always get the update notes as to whats still historically canonical. Are we still and have always been allies with Eurasia or did that recently never happen?
