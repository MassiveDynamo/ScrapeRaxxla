Mmm, wiktionary has a few definitions for brow that are new to me
The first tine of an antler's beam
The gangway from ship to shore when a ship is lying alongside a quay
The hinged part of a landing craft or ferry which is lowered to form a landing platform; a ramp.

So, are we looking for a deer with a jewel hanging on the first tine of its antlers? Must be greek mythology!

Perhaps our ships' brow will allow us to walk onto the jewel of the mother of galaxies and thus enter the portal to Raxxla when Odyssey drops?!

I knew they were releasing something good with space-legs.
