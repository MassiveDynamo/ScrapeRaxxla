Ah someone said it’s important to know what you know (awareness) and know what you don’t know (wisdom).
Its not knowing what you know (amnesia/senility) and not knowing what you don’t know (Questing/ politics) that gets you.

P.S. merriam-webster is US english, OED is UK english; there might be some differences and since FD are UK it might be significant at some stage.
