Jewel on the brow - Crown Jewels / Tiara? Any links there, didnt Salome have a Tiara?



Theres a time in life where you just have to accept....subtitles....we are not getting old, they are muttering and mumbling and talking slang and patois and strong accents



I think we've found the next 1000 pages for tinfoil. ill bet we can make loads fit from there



Youve done it now. frontier just turned up NPC interdictions and gave them grom bombs just for you

Overall - problem is there a lot of sci-fi and fantasy reference in game, either player named or frontier homage to it. 2001, Red Dwarf, Terry Pratchett, THGTTG, Lovecroft and loads more so its hard to know whats what and whats meant to be myth. Its mind boggingly big and complex.

Mmm, whatâ€™s that you say? Speak up man! Stop mumbling!!
Did you see the recent series (4 programmes, on Dave channel I think) about the history of Red Dwarf? Delightful.
