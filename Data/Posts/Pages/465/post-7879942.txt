Come on, Pa...
Wouldn't it be too much of a cool story-line for that game ?
(Like the exodus being to Bovomit and the other locked far regions ? FD has until late 2020 to implement atmospheric landings and sandcastles building in these systems. I hope.)
And this is my other concern with a path change on this one.

The path laid out is a direct route to a disaster for humanity.

Naturally I’m inclined to try and prevent that.

However... talking more meta now, diverting things off path could mean that what Jorki laid out doesn’t happen.

So player action changing the path on this one might actually lead things away from a path that many players seem to want. Yet if no path change is made then the situation of frustration at following a pre-ordained path remains. It’s quite the dilemma.
