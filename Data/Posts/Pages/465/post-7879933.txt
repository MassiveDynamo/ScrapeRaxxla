Wait and see.
Yes, and don’t get me wrong, I do understand why things are the way they are. My concern is that it’s now become a self fulfilling prophecy - everyone thinks that nothing of interest is going to happen and/or changing the path isn’t possible. So no one tries, at least not in significant numbers. What dominates is ‘see CG, do CG’. So the path doesn’t change and nothing interesting happens (at least in terms of players effecting the course of events). And everyone concludes that changing the path isn’t possible, and so the cycle continues. Quite the wheel. Not dark though. Or bright. Just a generic medium brightness beige.

The difficulty is of course that it’s not really possible to determine with certainty whether something does present an opportunity to change the path, or whether the path is pre-ordained.
