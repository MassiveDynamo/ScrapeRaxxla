Hmm... I think the situation here is different.

AEGIS’s stated plan is so blatantly a path to disaster, that it seems to me that an opportunity is being presented. The horses are being led to the water so to speak. Sadly, at the moment the horses in the main are standing around complaining that there’s nothing to drink. (Just what I see happening in general, not directed at anyone on this thread, just to be clear! )
