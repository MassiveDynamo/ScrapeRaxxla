Never trusted her either. Her vision was somewhat marred by her vantage point of several inches inside her own rectal passage.

However, what Jorki lays out is correct in broad strokes.

New barnacle areas will be found.

We will once again move in and steal the farmers harvest.

The farmer will react.

The only real question is whether it will be fields from the same farm or whether it will be fields in different farms, and if so how drastically the other farmersâ€™ reactions will be.

Apologies - this is way off topic.

Well honestly, 2 years after the end of the Coming of the New Messiah, I'm actually all for FDev doing something fundamental with life in the Bubble. There was much hope that the Gnosis debacle would lead to more in-game events, rather than things just happening on the Thursday tick, but that hasn't been the case. The first Interstellar Initiative was just a chained CG leading to a ferry service and a new weapon, so I don't expect this one to lead to anything significant either.

I think we've got more hope of finding Raxxla than of FDev shaking up the credit farming opportunities in the Bubble - though it WOULD be amusing if the Thargoids started treating ships full of void opals like 'we' do barnacles
