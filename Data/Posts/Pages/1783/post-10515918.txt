Agreed and in the past I've often wondered if there is a step in the process which involves a GM to verify the player's discovery of a key milestone, or to permit access somewhere. The GM would contact the player/s roleplaying as a DW agent giving instructions or clues for the next step. That could be one explanation for no clear confirmation of TDW existing. Obviously the contact could be automated in the usual systems FDev use already, but it is one avenue where FDev could represent themselves within the game world as the covert arm of the PF and thus would only reveal themselves when a Raxxla milestone is reached.
I mentioned a couple of pages ago that several players had reported a Friend request arriving from some unknown person when they had attained Elite. It was a while ago but should be searchable within this thread. I mostly play Solo and would have discarded any such request if I didnt know who they were from thread discussions.
