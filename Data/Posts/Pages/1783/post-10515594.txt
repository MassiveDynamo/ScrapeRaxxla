The Ryders were attacked by a specific Raxxla-funded assassin, not a pirate ... and "peaceful trader" was just Jason Ryder's cover story.

Alex's first action following the attack is to steal an entire ship from a cemetery, and then later he engages in smuggling of illegal goods (rather more illegal than he thought, yes) to an undocumented system.

I expect the rest of TDW only follows the law when it happens to be convenient to them, too.

This might be a key theme many of us have ignored, myself included.

The mythos of Raxxla in ED I suspect is as much concentrated upon the works and themes of Robert Holdstock as it is as anything else. So equally those themes specifically I suspect have been utilised to shape what Raxxla could be and how to find it.

The Dark Wheel book is filled with an odd heroes journey yet it’s certainly set upon a dark path, as @Ian Doncaster points out.

I do suspect The Dark Wheel ‘was’ originally tied to the quest; simply through the linguistic clues hinted at ‘place that is not a place’ etc.

And of course Trinkets were linked too as FD has confirmed, which themselves can only be pirated.

We then have the odd injected text from the codex about a pirates stash etc, and dark despotic individuals…

The only official ED book that was allowed to talk about Raxxla; Elite Legacy, is upon its wider concept focused upon the secretively nefarious and powerful Cavus family.

I do wonder if some paths towards Raxxla (if still active) are actually supposed to be very dark, and shrouded in machinations!
