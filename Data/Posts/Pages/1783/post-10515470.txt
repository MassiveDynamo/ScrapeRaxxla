But the Ryders were traders who were themselves ganked by pirates ..... so becoming pirates to join TDW seems not to be in character ?
The Ryders were attacked by a specific Raxxla-funded assassin, not a pirate ... and "peaceful trader" was just Jason Ryder's cover story.

Alex's first action following the attack is to steal an entire ship from a cemetery, and then later he engages in smuggling of illegal goods (rather more illegal than he thought, yes) to an undocumented system.

I expect the rest of TDW only follows the law when it happens to be convenient to them, too.
