It appears to show the ship leaving the original main menu, but the image is reversed.

Have the stars in the new background been identified, and especially that Nebula, to allow for triangulation?!?!
That nebula is the LMC the one of 3 closest galaxys to the Milky way and somewhat in the same gravitational pull/or part or our local galaxy group it is featured a ton since release and some suspect this is where the Raxxla gate/[portal is linked to, if you move around the galaxy map towards it you will notice how close it is and even see it is not just a static image like the other galaxys show...a place that is not a place...yet also chimes in with Brabens...its in the Galaxy map...a bit to obvious
