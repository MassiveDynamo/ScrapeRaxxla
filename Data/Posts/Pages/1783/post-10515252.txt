OK I've done a billion credits worth of missions in Pareco the last couple of weeks, no new inbox / tip-off missions received. I've also again carefully explored the edge of Asire's sphere of influence. Even though the comet is just 17km outside Asire, at no point does the comet's USS or sphere of influence ever appear in the HUD. Its completely swamped by Asire's 100km wide shipping lane. I can go to the approximate (within guage accuracy) location of the comet, either in normal space or by dropping out of SC. It makes no difference. All I get is shipping lane. So .... any other ideas folks? I've used night vision, I've honked repeatedly to no avail. There must be some other way of progressing from here. I know folks have suggested that i carry trinkets of fortune, but the fact you can only acquire them by pirating peaceful NPC traders makes me feel this really can't be the way forward.
in other news, has anyone else yet become allied and receieved the blackman silo data theft mission ?
