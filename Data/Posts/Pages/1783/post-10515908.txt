Given the close relationship between TDW and Raxxla in the original novella discussion of TDW is quite acceptable in this thread. However while I personally believe Raxxla is hidden within the game, I'm not convinced TDW is anything other than narrative fluff (but I remain open to the possibility I could be wrong on this!), FD have never confirmed its existence, whereas both DB and MB did so for Raxxla.
Agreed and in the past I've often wondered if there is a step in the process which involves a GM to verify the player's discovery of a key milestone, or to permit access somewhere. The GM would contact the player/s roleplaying as a DW agent giving instructions or clues for the next step. That could be one explanation for no clear confirmation of TDW existing. Obviously the contact could be automated in the usual systems FDev use already, but it is one avenue where FDev could represent themselves within the game world as the covert arm of the PF and thus would only reveal themselves when a Raxxla milestone is reached.
