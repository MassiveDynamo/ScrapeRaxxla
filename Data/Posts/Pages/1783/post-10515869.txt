Off on another topic, the new 10 year anniversary logo, which I find peculiar in that it represents a ship seemingly traversing across a divide, which clearly shows two diametrically different locations!

Being literal here in the interpretation, and very likely grabbing at invisible straws, because given FD supposed scientific accuracy, I just find that particular artistic impression an oddity.

A place that is not a place, an otherworld, a location apart from ours in another dimension, travelled to via a border or doorway… it’s a little bit too over the top, for a logo, also any intentional Raxxla link here advocates a ‘narrative’ aspect, which I’m not keen upon.

So is it supposed to be a reflection?

Like earthtone pointed out, it is interesting that it uses the main menu splash screen but mirrored.

Given the context of FDev's effort in revitalising the game's features, I would imagine it's an artistic choice - with a literal reflection of the last 10 years of accomplishment encapsulated within the Griffin logo, and doubling as a symbolic mirror reflecting the viewer's involvement.

So in that sense, yes there is no doubt a post-Titan era enthusiasm for change being communicated, which may introduce new narrative elements in proximity to Raxxla. However, because of that sense of enthusiasm I don't see why they would want funnel us closer to solving Raxxla via narrative elements. The day they do that, it would be a sign to me that the project is being sunsetted for end-of-life closure, and they would want us to find it before it's gone.

I noticed they included Braben retelling the story of the Guardians being found too early. It's a great anecdote for the video, but it also reinforces how impactful it was to the dev team. Sadly for us it made them wiser about showing any loose threads we could easily tug on for clues
