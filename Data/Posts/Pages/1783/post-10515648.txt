Off on another topic, the new 10 year anniversary logo, which I find peculiar in that it represents a ship seemingly traversing across a divide, which clearly shows two diametrically different locations!

Being literal here in the interpretation, and very likely grabbing at invisible straws, because given FD supposed scientific accuracy, I just find that particular artistic impression an oddity.

A place that is not a place, an otherworld, a location apart from ours in another dimension, travelled to via a border or doorway… it’s a little bit too over the top, for a logo, also any intentional Raxxla link here advocates a ‘narrative’ aspect, which I’m not keen upon.

So is it supposed to be a reflection?

It appears to show the ship leaving the original main menu, but the image is reversed.

Have the stars in the new background been identified, and especially that Nebula, to allow for triangulation?!?!
