OK I've done a billion credits worth of missions in Pareco the last couple of weeks, no new inbox / tip-off missions received.
I got to Allied last week but didn't get any tip-offs - but I didn't have time to do many actual missions once Allied, either, especially since I was restricting them to types which could be both taken and completed in the Pareco system in case that mattered. Will give it another go in the next few days, though, since even if it does nothing mysterious I should at least get the tip-off!

but the fact you can only acquire them by pirating peaceful NPC traders makes me feel this really can't be the way forward.
Out of interest, why not? I don't see anything in the hints we've been given which suggests that the route to Raxxla (or to the Dark Wheel) will be entirely legal.

Indeed, if the theory that Raxxla is secretly being used to dominate humanity is true, I might expect actions which had a chance of finding it to be much more likely than average to be illegal, given who gets to set the laws.

Alllied with all factions yesterday, haven't seen any data theft missions yet (was it in your in box?)
Yes - tip-off missions will show up as an inbox message once you complete an ordinary mission while Allied. The chances of getting one are relatively low per mission, though I don't think the mission type itself matters.
