Off on another topic, the new 10 year anniversary logo, which I find peculiar in that it represents a ship seemingly traversing across a divide, which clearly shows two diametrically different locations!

Being literal here in the interpretation, and very likely grabbing at invisible straws, because given FD supposed scientific accuracy, I just find that particular artistic impression an oddity.

A place that is not a place, an otherworld, a location apart from ours in another dimension, travelled to via a border or doorway… it’s a little bit too over the top, for a logo, also any intentional Raxxla link here advocates a ‘narrative’ aspect, which I’m not keen upon.

So is it supposed to be a reflection?
