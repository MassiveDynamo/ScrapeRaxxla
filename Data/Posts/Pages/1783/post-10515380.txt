Out of interest, why not? I don't see anything in the hints we've been given which suggests that the route to Raxxla (or to the Dark Wheel) will be entirely legal.

Indeed, if the theory that Raxxla is secretly being used to dominate humanity is true, I might expect actions which had a chance of finding it to be much more likely than average to be illegal, given who gets to set the laws.
But the Ryders were traders who were themselves ganked by pirates ..... so becoming pirates to join TDW seems not to be in character ?
