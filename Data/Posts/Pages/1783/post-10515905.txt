Off on another topic, the new 10 year anniversary logo, which I find peculiar in that it represents a ship seemingly traversing across a divide, which clearly shows two diametrically different locations!

Being literal here in the interpretation, and very likely grabbing at invisible straws, because given FD supposed scientific accuracy, I just find that particular artistic impression an oddity.

A place that is not a place, an otherworld, a location apart from ours in another dimension, travelled to via a border or doorway… it’s a little bit too over the top, for a logo, also any intentional Raxxla link here advocates a ‘narrative’ aspect, which I’m not keen upon.

So is it supposed to be a reflection?

May be a reflection. May be a "window" (or Rift??) through which another location is visible. But it is showing a Coriolis, and we know Coriolis are the oldest type of station (hence the most likely to be forgotten and reused by TDW, whose name itself may be obfuscation, Lyta Crane AFAIK is the only sour e that says their station is toroidal). A Coriolis features in the game startup vid, with, IIRC, the same star-lit planetary edge. So is this a hint to go back to the startup vid for a clue?

Or, as suggested above, it may just be an allusion to the original game's stations and Cobra mk3, with wireframe graphics limited mission functionality transitioning to the stunning visual and gameplay depth (?) of the current game.
