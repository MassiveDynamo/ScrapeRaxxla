I know this is the raxxla thread, not the TDW thread, but just in case it triggers anything, I'm going to throw this out for consideration. I remember a pulp scifi book from my youth (larry niven?) whose cover showed an alien world with a black spoked nebula above it (A "dark wheel"). So I went looking for something similar and found the vulpecula dark region. Whilst checking the view of the nebula from all the nearby stars I reached 13 vulpecula. Now vulpecula is "fox" and the 13 vulpecula A star has an LYT combination. And fox and crane being a famous aristotle parable it seemed this could be a "lyta crane" reference. The A 7 A planet makes an excellent reference for the TDW station picture from a distance of 0.6 LY. But i spent a couple of months there - visiting unknown signals and rescuing NPC miners from NPC pirates. Nothing came up, and I couldnt find a station so i gave up. but 13 vulpecula is about 250LY, too far out for raxxla but could potentially be a modern base for TDW. Anything chime?
