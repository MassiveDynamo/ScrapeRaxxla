I have been looking at the raxxla symbol for coordinates. The numbers that make sense to me are:

6.18.3.0.1, or 618.301 or 6.183.01

There are six shapes, surrounding 18 dashes, with three parts of a circle, with what looks like a zero and a dot in the center equaling a one.

That's what I get out of it, if it means something to someone else as for some set of coordinates.

As it turns out, 618301 is a prime number.

If you look at the Right Ascension/declinations I posted a few days ago, that's the numbers I was using for the "lines"
