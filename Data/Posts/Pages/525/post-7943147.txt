Best I can figure after hours of pondering reviewing the clues is that it is a gateway (wormhole) as such to another system.. and seeing how FDEV takes alot of its idea's from movies from the past.. there is a 85% chance this is correct.. I have a hunch it starts in SOL around the moon TITAN.. because some best kept secrets are the ones right under our noses.. now that being said.. if its a wormhole we wouldn't detect it with a scanner.. so we would have to visually see it as a distortion in the game while looking around the moon. But to aid on finding its location my next theory would be to use a pulse wave scanner, to help find magnetic distortions?? just putting two and two togther we got the introduction of pulse wave scanners and a codex on Raxxla close togther.. and yes someone might have flown through the system and never realized it as FDEV stated... As it would be the exit from the SOL entrance so... the pieces of the puzzle are coming together fast.

Raxxla is a 6 digit code for its location with the 7th digit being SOL's location. So someone in mathematical engineering, I am asking for you help in these calculations so we can pin point it's location??

Some have claimed the exit would be roughly around 157 ly away.. in the search for a system that far away it brought me to the constellation Capricornus of which is my main focus...thus the Nashira system... derived from the Arabic phrase for " bearer of good news". and behold a star is classified as a Alpha-2 Canum Venaticorum type variable, a chemically peculiar star with "STRONG MAGNETIC FIELDS" ??? a possible exit..
