Raxxla is a 6 digit code for its location with the 7th digit being SOL's location. So someone in mathematical engineering, I am asking for you help in these calculations so we can pin point it's location??

Well assuming the dots around the edges are numbers 565656 or 656565

I guess there are a variety of coordinates just based on the galmap ones such as:

56/56/56 65/65/65
5/565/6 6/656/5
