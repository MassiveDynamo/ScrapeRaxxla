I notice there are 6 systems in the megaship route. Can lines be drawn between different pairs to find an intersection on galmap? Just a thought
Three systems, all adjacent.

But that has stirred a thought from my brain- might be more obfuscation here. Might pop back to Alteraâ€™s Eye and do some deep system searching, just in case.
