I have been looking at the raxxla symbol for coordinates. The numbers that make sense to me are:

6.18.3.0.1, or 618.301 or 6.183.01

There are six shapes, surrounding 18 dashes, with three parts of a circle, with what looks like a zero and a dot in the center equaling a one.

That's what I get out of it, if it means something to someone else as for some set of coordinates.

o7....

But there arent 18 dashes

Maybe try 33
