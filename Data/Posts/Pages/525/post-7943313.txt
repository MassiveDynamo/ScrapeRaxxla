Did I miss the part where it has to be a prime number or are you guys putting proverbial words in mouths and treating as a law?

Non objective research will probably bear more fruit than seeking specific results. It's proven that if you are looking for specific results you can bend and twist any findings to fit your criteria. It's how the same reports both prove and disprove global warming depending on who's reading it.

certainly not trying to discredit anyone. I just don't know personally how the prime numbers fit into this. like I said I might have missed something that somebody said that makes it make sense.
