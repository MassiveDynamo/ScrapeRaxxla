Yeah... I remember MB saying that. Years ago. Since, generations of new players sacrificed jump range for.. nothing.
No half-measures work, imho. Either an overpowered Vette/Cutter or a stripped-out Conda.
Anything in-between is just nonsense. Imho.
(Not talking about fuel slug Rails which are then more a device for helping in hardcore explo than a weapon)

I liked the Cutter for trading & shipped it out to Colonia. Didn’t like the Corvette- nice handling but very poor jump range. The Phantom is nice, manoeuvrable and nippy, just needed a couple more slots. The weapons actually only took about 0.6ly off the range, so left them on for DW2- had been using it for mission running beforehand. But it’s nice to have a beam for energising any guardian constructs that might be found, and a PA with plasma slug effect is useful for using fuel to decrease load to increase jump range if necessary.

Annie was really good for slots & range, but it’s a bit on the large side & not sufficiently manoeuvrable or speedy; worst of all is the cockpit (lack of) visibility. I’ve always thought it needed to make use of that currently pointless chin window- get a camera suite &/or observer in there.

Edit: that said & all in all I think the Phantom is currently the best balanced ship for exploration. Maybe need to have another look at it; might need to reengineer it since we got the extra slot.
