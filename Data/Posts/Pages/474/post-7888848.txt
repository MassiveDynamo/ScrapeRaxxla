Yeah.. But again, Pa, efficiency doesn't accept half-measures.
Playing around with the pals of a re-edited expedition for fun is one thing.
Another thing is to get the work done asap.
Explo: Conda/AspX. Just like it has always been.
Imho.
And believe me, a tanky Cutter with 3 Pacifiers and 4 Frags get you out of any trouble.

I prefer the Phantom to the AspX once the credit balance is reached. Visibility is almost as good, but more speed and, I think, manoeuvrability, and longer jump range.
But I’mnot into combat. Will give you the vette or the cutter for that. I remember running endless trade missions (to get Jorki’s second elite) in the cutter; any npc interdiction just turn 180, put her into reverse and pound em with those hardpoints!
