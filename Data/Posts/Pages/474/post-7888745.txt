If you're the one to find Raxxla I promise you either a bottle of Islay Malt or Highland Pure Malt. No Irish or Bourbon though.

Ah, a man after my own heart (soul? )
Quite like Islay, especially Laphraig Quarter Cask, also very fond of The Ardmore.
Not a fan of Irish or Bourbon, though Bourbon tastes much better in USA than it does in UK. My son is into Japanese whisky; each to his own, I guess he inherited my good looks
