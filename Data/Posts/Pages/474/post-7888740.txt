I think if “it” is really there then to trigger it you’ll need to visit Zeta Cass and NGC 7822 (probably S171 37, I was surprised (& suspicious) to find a tourist beacon there!) first, and possibly find TDW station too, which I reason is in the vicinity of either Zeta Cass or NGC 7822. I suspect the CTD was triggered by something/some sequence which I couldn’t repeat. Frustrating!

Edit: doubly frustrating since Scytale promised me a bottle of brandy if I found Raxxla!

If you're the one to find Raxxla I promise you either a bottle of Islay Malt or Highland Pure Malt. No Irish or Bourbon though.
