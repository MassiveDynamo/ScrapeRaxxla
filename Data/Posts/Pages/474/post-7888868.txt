just imagine discovering the guardian beacon and not having any laser weapons ,would have been kind of useless wouldn't it have? I feel this could be a good reason he said that
Right ! Am I dumb ? Never forget the "ED Translator for Communication With Alien Life" !
Gunship diplomacy got us where we are. (Just like IRL..)
But good point ! MB may very well have said that for this reason! The thing is most (all ?) of the players interpreted his words into another meaning.

I prefer the Phantom to the AspX once the credit balance is reached. Visibility is almost as good, but more speed and, I think, manoeuvrability, and longer jump range.
Wait ! Full stripped and engineered both, the Phantom beats the AspX in jump range ?
Such a long time I haven't played...
