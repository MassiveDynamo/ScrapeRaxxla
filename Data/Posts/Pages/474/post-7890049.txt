So I think the whole point of the 4 dimensional thing is that a 4 dimensional object appears to change its physical 3 dimensional form as we scrub through time. This implies to me that Raxxla physically changes with time - could be as simple a change as a displacement.

More simply put: Raxxla moves.

Q
Movement through time does not (necessarily) a tesseract make. Important to remember that any representation of a tesseract that we can comprehend visually in 3 dimensional space is only an analog ... it isn't itself a tesseract. When we talk about 3 dimensional space we typically fail to mention the dimension of time. A cube already exists in height, depth, width and time (four dimensions if you want to get technical). A tesseract is a cube that exist in heigh, width, depth, time ... and some other dimension that we poor humans can't perceive. A better example would be flatland. Its not that Raxxla is necessarily moving but more like it is sitting right next to us but existing in space that we simply can't comprehend.
