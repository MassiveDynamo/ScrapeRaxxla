Seasoned explorer Ol' Pa still wondering what ship to use for explo ???
Beam and PA for.. what ? To make the Distant Gankers die from laugh or to shoot at Cone- like Thargs and end at a detention facility thousands of Ly away ?

Reassurance!
I still remember Michael Brookes saying explorers should go armed.....
But I donâ€™t think any ship is ideal. I liked my Phantom during DW2, but would like a little more range and a second AFMU.
