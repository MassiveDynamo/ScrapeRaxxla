we might need to learn about what a tesseract actualy is, and what it does. that would be a good starting point and could give some clues.
i know that a tesseract is a 4 dimentional cube. and that's about it. lol
i will do some research as im clueless when it comes to this.

on a fun note : i saw some documentary long ago, about how a 4rth dimentional object would be the perfect place to hide things, as the 4rth dimention of the object is never seen from a simple first glance and observation. a change in point of view or perception has to happen in order for the 4rth dimention to be visible. just like from the animated tesseract gif above.

So I think the whole point of the 4 dimensional thing is that a 4 dimensional object appears to change its physical 3 dimensional form as we scrub through time. This implies to me that Raxxla physically changes with time - could be as simple a change as a displacement.

More simply put: Raxxla moves.
