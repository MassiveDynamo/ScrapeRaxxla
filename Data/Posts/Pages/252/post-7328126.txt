Noob here! I've just started playing elite and have been lurking in this and the alien threads for a bit. After watching some of the videos describing how alien bases were found, what jumped out to me was the statement that "it should be obvious" where Raxxla is. When looking at the galaxy map today I notice a galactic region called Izanami and thought "lovers woe". Could the initial paragraph be pointing us towards Raxxla? After discussing with some squad mates we found an area that might be worth checking out. "The parent's grief" could refer to Achillies Altar and the story of Achillies killing hector and the grief it brought to King Param. "The lovers woe" could refer to Lyra's song. Lyra is derived from lyre. If you read about Orpheus, he was taught to play the lyre by Apollo and, when his wife Eurydice died, he played a song so sad the nymphs and gods wept. Hades even allowed him the chance to take his wife back from the underworld. Orpheus also traveled with the Argonauts on a quest, this just after Eurydice has died which captures the line "the yearning of our vagabond hearts". And in referring to the underworld and the "darkest void" Xibalba sits just below these two galactic regions. The underworld ruled by Mayan death gods. There is also a line "the siren of the deepest void" which would place more meaning on the story of the lyre and Orpheus being right next to the underworld. If you look where these three sections merge there is a lot of empty space but we were able to find a system PLAE EUR UE-R D4-0. Maybe something? If not, the names of the galactic regions tie in quite a bit to the text in the toast of Raxxla so there maybe a way to triangulate the location.
