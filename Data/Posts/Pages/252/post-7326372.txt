I've been following the Raxxla story (so to speak) since 3301, and finally have something that may help.

1) Technology was older, so we should first think of that. It was theoretically fairly close to Lave - Old FSD didn't have the range we do now, and the bubble was smaller, so I would recommend starting a new search with Lave as the center.

2) Possibility of player(s) having gone through the system that contains Raxxla. My first thought here is from my last exploration trip. I would often skip heading out to explore planets and stars if they were over 50-100,000LS away from entry. And judging from my findings while exploring (where I'd estimate that 80% of systems that I visited with these far flung stars only had the closest ones surveyed.) a TON of other explorers also follow this MO, and often skip heading out that far if the "main bodies" (close to entry) have previously been scanned.

It'll be a bit of a drudge to investigate these far-flung stars and systems, but I would bet that this is where she's hiding.

The Logo as map, might be a thing, especially with the comment by Brooke (Might have the name wrong here) about needing to make a bit obvious. With the new Orrey view of systems, we might be able to "overlay" that on the correct system's Orrey View, to find the path to Raxxla.

Edit: Also, as the lore seems to indicate that there are a group of Elites that actively protect their Golden Goose, I do recommend extreme caution. They apparently have access to technology from other galaxies, so expect to be met with a rebuy screen.

I mention this NOT to dissuade people from searching, but to ensure they are noting their locations external to their Ship computer, so that WHEN we find it, we do not lose the location!
