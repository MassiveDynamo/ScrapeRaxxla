As far as I'm aware, all nebulae in game have their own entry that can be searched for. If you check any proc gen nebula, it will have a proc gen style name including a subsector designation (like AA-A H1, or similar). The entry is that for the nebula itself rather than for a star.

Ah, that would make sense. Well, never mind my post then. Thanks!
