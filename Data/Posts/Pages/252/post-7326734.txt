Still a new account, hope this won't get buried, but thought it might interest you. Equip tinfoil hats

Long story short: i found a system that can't be flown to, can't be selected, but is there on the map. It might be a bug, a mistake on my part, or some placeholder, but. <snip>
I like this theory because it ties in well to the idea that Universal Cartographics / Pilots Fed are in on the secret. But I'm reminded of the reddit thread about pulsars, I think. I can't find the thread, but long story short, if you go to the galaxy map and type "PSR" into the search bar and hit enter, you're taken to a point at the bottom of the galactic disk (maybe the origin of the grid system? I don't remember). The difference here is that this is an actual visible system that can't be selected, which I've never seen before.

I'm currently grinding for Guardian technology mats for the enhanced FSD booster; once that's done I'm going to head back out to the Formidine Rift. I'm of the opinion that Raxxla might be in the bubble, but the key/map to it might be hidden somewhere out there.
