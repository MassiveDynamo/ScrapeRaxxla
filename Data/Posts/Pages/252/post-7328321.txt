Right. I think it's in the bubble as well. I mean, it was in the past, so why not? At least the gateway to it was. Lave system...if I remember correctly. It's location is probably pretty obvious, too. Maybe the key is figuring out the Polaris permit ordeal, or maybe it's even simpler. The Sol system, Shinrarta, maybe even Sirius... but like the Lave system maybe it involves flying around the system a certain amount of times, in a certain direction and jumping to a specific destination within specific amount of jumps to unlock the gateway to Raxxla. But what if someone finds it? That would mean another alien race contact. Other than Thargoids. Raxxlans are a warrior race. If you find Raxxla, you have to prove yourself in combat. That's how Raxxlans are. So there's finding the gateway to it...and then surviving. Assuming something didn't already happen to the Raxxlans. Remember, Raxxla is likely anywhere... It could still even be in another galaxy. It's the gateway we need. I wouldn't be surprised if there is a whole other game to this game. Another completely procedural generated galaxy.

No point in generating another galaxy when this one have 0,1% visited star systems (or had a year ago). Too bad there's no online ticker somewhere, would be cool.
IMO, it should be a series of gateways throughout our Galaxy which allow you to travel faster. Like, a way to supercharge your FSD, only not 4 times, but 100 times, for example.
Having such network of gateways would indeed mean something for developing humanity out of the bubble.
With one of those gateways being somewhere inside the bubble.
