Also, one of strange things that i stumbled upon, it's most likely not connected to the Raxxla search, but why not:

On the wiki and Cannon website there is listed only one comms beacon for Formidine site Beta in Eafots LZ-H b10-0
However arriving there i found 2 of those.
Quick google didn't get me a definitive answer, so was it already discussed and discovered earlier, or is that one beacon a new thing, as it's not listed in the original Formidine rift project?

Listened for both, message is the same, one is broadcasting every hour at the start of an hour, second is broadcasting at 15 minutes past sart of an hour.
Nothing to see there.
