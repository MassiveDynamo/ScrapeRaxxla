Long story short: i found a system that can't be flown to, can't be selected, but is there on the map. It might be a bug, a mistake on my part, or some placeholder, but.

As far as I'm aware, all nebulae in game have their own entry that can be searched for. If you check any proc gen nebula, it will have a proc gen style name including a subsector designation (like AA-A H1, or similar). The entry is that for the nebula itself rather than for a star.
