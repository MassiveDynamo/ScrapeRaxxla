Thought I'd bring this back up, after looking at a few things. Wonder if this has more meaning now, especially with the recent re-surface to find Raxxla thanks to the Codex.

Not sure whether it has any real meaning. But after a trip to Tionisla I came across a Tourist Beacon called "Curious Transmission Partially Decoded. It references a Galnet event I remember a year, or so ago with an antique Cobra MK3 around the Tionisla grave yard. Well most of this was just useless lore stuff the message is apparently transmitted after it had been destroyed was : " The Vain Queen rides a Giraffe that remembers her daughter's hero " I may not be up to speed, but it just seems rather curious and wondering does this have any reference to anything? and does anyone here think it might be in anyway related to Raxxla?

https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDange...us_transmission_partially_decoded_galnet_101/ Is what I've found, which makes some uncanny coincidences with what's been found in here recently. Cassiopeia ect.. Andromeda. And again makes reference to the Heart and Soul Nebulae.

For anyone that didn't use the link



Could this help us in some way?

Yeah, this was related to the Formadine Rift mystery, and pointed us to the abandoned settlements and, eventually, the Zurara.
