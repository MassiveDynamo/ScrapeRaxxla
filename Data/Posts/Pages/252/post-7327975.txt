Ok! A few Things:

1). Whats the deal with Lave 2? Every now and again i see it mentioned along with the Raxxla mystery by some CMDRs. As though its somehow connected. Yet i've never found anything that suggests it has anything to do with it. I know that the author of "Lave Revolution" requested Fdev to permit lock the planet for some reason. I read that whole book and found nothing. I've read somewhere else from one CMDR that Lave 2 ether was, is, or replaced Raxxla, according to them. Was Lave 2 connected to the Raxxla mystery in some book i haven't read?

I'd also like more info on this, if anyone has any links / relevant information?

As to your second point - That's a very good one about the Quirium Drives. I'd personally forgotten about them. I'd still like to form a concerted effort to investigate in the bubble (Specifically systems with stars and planets that are far from the entry point, and often skipped, due to the time it takes to get there.) just to be sure. Considering how many stars there are in the galaxy, it'd be good to at least eliminate the ones we already live around... unless your second point is true, then even if we search everything out, without knowing the movement pattern, it almost doesn't matter where we are looking, if it's the wrong time of day or week or month or year for it to be in the area you are investigating.
