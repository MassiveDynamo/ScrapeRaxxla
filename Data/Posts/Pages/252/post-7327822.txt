Ok! A few Things:

1). Whats the deal with Lave 2? Every now and again i see it mentioned along with the Raxxla mystery by some CMDRs. As though its somehow connected. Yet i've never found anything that suggests it has anything to do with it. I know that the author of "Lave Revolution" requested Fdev to permit lock the planet for some reason. I read that whole book and found nothing. I've read somewhere else from one CMDR that Lave 2 ether was, is, or replaced Raxxla, according to them. Was Lave 2 connected to the Raxxla mystery in some book i haven't read?

2). When mentioning Raxxla possibly being close to the bubble, there seem to be something that gets continually forgotten: THE QUIRIUM DRIVES EXISTED! http://elite-dangerous.wikia.com/wiki/Hyperdrive#cite_note-:0-2 & https://community.elitedangerous.com/en/galnet/uid/586f796c9657ba3357039d07 these drive were said, once engineered, "to jump across the galaxy or even to other galaxies"!
Yes i'm aware that the official first mentioning of Raxxla was in 2296, and that its implied that the legend was already in circulation before. BUT! To believe that it is close to the bubble one has to assume that A.) Raxxla is stationary and not mobile. And B.) Nothing from Raxxla made travel to and from it possible BEFORE faster hyperspace travel was even available to the rest of the galaxy. The Quirium Drive fuel secret HAD to come from somewhere as well!
