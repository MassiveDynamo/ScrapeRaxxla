I like this theory because it ties in well to the idea that Universal Cartographics / Pilots Fed are in on the secret. But I'm reminded of the reddit thread about pulsars, I think. I can't find the thread, but long story short, if you go to the galaxy map and type "PSR" into the search bar and hit enter, you're taken to a point at the bottom of the galactic disk (maybe the origin of the grid system? I don't remember). The difference here is that this is an actual visible system that can't be selected, which I've never seen before.

I'm currently grinding for Guardian technology mats for the enhanced FSD booster; once that's done I'm going to head back out to the Formidine Rift. I'm of the opinion that Raxxla might be in the bubble, but the key/map to it might be hidden somewhere out there.


Right. I think it's in the bubble as well. I mean, it was in the past, so why not? At least the gateway to it was. Lave system...if I remember correctly. It's location is probably pretty obvious, too. Maybe the key is figuring out the Polaris permit ordeal, or maybe it's even simpler. The Sol system, Shinrarta, maybe even Sirius... but like the Lave system maybe it involves flying around the system a certain amount of times, in a certain direction and jumping to a specific destination within specific amount of jumps to unlock the gateway to Raxxla. But what if someone finds it? That would mean another alien race contact. Other than Thargoids. Raxxlans are a warrior race. If you find Raxxla, you have to prove yourself in combat. That's how Raxxlans are. So there's finding the gateway to it...and then surviving. Assuming something didn't already happen to the Raxxlans. Remember, Raxxla is likely anywhere... It could still even be in another galaxy. It's the gateway we need. I wouldn't be surprised if there is a whole other game to this game. Another completely procedural generated galaxy.
