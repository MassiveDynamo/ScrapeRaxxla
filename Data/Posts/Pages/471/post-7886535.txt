And Prester John was an early 20th Century book by John Buchan set in South Africa, vaguely remember reading it at school more years ago than I care to remember!

It is, and its about diamond smuggling in S/Africa. Buchan's usual swashbuckling style..

There is also a book:

in which PJ is character - its a fantasy novel with a plot-line that mirrors the empire sucession story with Patreus quite closely..
