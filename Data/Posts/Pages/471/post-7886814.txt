Quick RL point - the description of Quantum Entanglement here is a little inaccurate and slightly misleading.
What’s happening is not that something is being changed for one particle, it’s that something’s being measured for it. Because the particles are entangled, that means that measuring a value for one, also means the value for the other particle is then also known.
To try to clarify, ‘changing’ would constitute altering from known value A to known value B. What’s happening is going from <value not set> to <value known>
i agree but i would like to add that i never specified when the measuring is made, and it makes all the difference. if we suppose we have 2 entangled Particles A and B. technically you can know and set the value of the particle B by not making measurements on it, and changing properties on particle A first. that would mean that, at the moment when you observe/measure particle B after changes made to A, B would mirror those changes from A in whatever ways it may. and therefore :

“whatever changes made to one particle is reflected and mirrored onto the other entangled pair particle.” + as long as the measurements are done after the change and not before.
because it's at the moment of the measuring/observing, that the observed particle would take it's form wich is Based and Effected By the current state(not the original state) of it's Entangled pair Particle.
oh man, quantum physics is quite confusing. lol
