Or.. The Door is the Event Horizon and The Key is the Singularity ?
But it has been tried so many times...
Or do we need some TDW/Tharg/Guardian tech to reach the Singularity ?
Never understood why FD made the BHs inoffensive/unreachable ( a safety process inherent to the inboard computer ?)... Is there because one of them hides a special game mechanic ?
