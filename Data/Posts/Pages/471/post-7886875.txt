I have no doubt that the raxxla logo is some form of a tesseract. What I dont see is what that gets us in terms of a clue or jumping off point.
maybe we should stop thinking of raxxla as a body in a system potentially and like some have suggested, more like the nonhuman artifact. Where it might be a location on a body in a system. Or like the guardian beacon, it might be something we have to activate and then fly through.

Which we already kind of thought that could be so basically yeah gets us nowhere
