Alternatively, the Key could be a cube-shaped object small enough to carry in cargo, maybe smaller (I wouldn't rule out the Martian Relic). If activated, it transports you back inside the partner cube (although you would possibly find it difficult to get back home from there, this is not inconsistent with the apparent history).

very interresting and fascinating idea, about the 2 cubes being attached to each other like from the logo. and holding one in your cargo, could teleport you to the other.
there exist a scientific Observation from actual real life experiments called Quantum Entanglement, that sounds very similar to this.

Quantum entanglement is a physical phenomenon that occurs when pairs or groups of particles are generated, interact, or share spatial proximity in ways such that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently of the state of the others, even when the particles are separated by a large distance. whatever changes made to one particle is reflected and mirrored onto the other entangled pair particle. they act as if they are the same entity existing in two different places at the same time.
