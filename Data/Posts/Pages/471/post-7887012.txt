Just to throw some poopoo at the wall...

Has anyone tried to animate the Raxxla logo so that it spins? Perhaps if it spins with the center dot remaining in the center, it begins to show a different image. I know it sounds dumb but it would tie in with the spiraling stars and well why not try it at THIS point. Lol

Here you go. I'm not sure this illuminates anything new, but it looks cool.
