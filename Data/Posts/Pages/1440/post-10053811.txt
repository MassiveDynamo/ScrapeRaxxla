Veliaze does of course not exist in ED.
It does and it is further referenced in "Galactic News: The Thargoids" and I have been there personally. The events in the system now known as Zelada perfectly match what happened other the small detail that the Federation had a whole battle group kicked by pirates. Aymiay and Ququve are even nearby and it is exactly where it should be (including the planet New Africa). This is precisely why The Church of the Path is in the Shibboleth system. You had to hunt down Veliaze/Zelada using the "Notable Presidents" beacon in Sol. The story is rather directly linked to President Olaf Smith. Why? Because the religious group out of Aymiay apparently runs the Federation per Revised Catholic Mission beacon. Though, given their sacred sites are the palm tree stations (Mars High is one such a station) they run the Bubble as a whole. Also, they apparently don't much care for Thargoids as those may well be Delta Phoenicis Palms.
