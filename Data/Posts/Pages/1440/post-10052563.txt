Regarding the body found floating in space at the Wreaken Construction site in Col 70 Sector, reported in Galnet in 3303, this was an in-game reference to an event in Elite Dangerous: Premonition by Drew Wagar. It has nothing to do with Raxxla, rather a conspiracy within the book.
I thought that was in "..And Here the Wheel" and was directly linked to the actions of Robert Garry (grandson of Oberon Ryder):





It wasn't just one death. It was thousands. That Galnet ("Galactic News: Body found at Wreaken Construction Site") was majorly downplaying what went down.
