The problem at this point appears to be which leads are viable? I still maintain technetium mention in "...And Here the Wheel" indicates Guardians due to S-process nucleosynthesis that is unique amongst asymptote giant branch stars. That said, chasing every anomaly in the story is getting old fast. Also, as cited in one of my post earlier it was clear Wreaken has been targeted before. The details we do have seem too sparse to give even an approximate region.
