It does and it is further referenced in "Galactic News: The Thargoids" and I have been there personally. The events in the system now known as Zelada perfectly match what happened other the small detail that the Federation had a whole battle group kicked by pirates. Aymiay and Ququve are even nearby and it is exactly where it should be (including the planet New Africa). This is precisely why The Church of the Path is in the Shibboleth system. You had to hunt down Veliaze/Zelada using the "Notable Presidents" beacon in Sol. The story is rather directly linked to President Olaf Smith. Why? Because the religious group out of Aymiay apparently runs the Federation per Revised Catholic Mission beacon. Though, given their sacred sites are the palm tree stations (Mars High is one such a station) they run the Bubble as a whole. Also, they apparently don't much care for Thargoids as those may well be Delta Phoenicis Palms.
Zelada and Veliaze were two separate systems in FFE. FD just moved some events because they forgot to put in Veliaze in the system list, when they generated the Galaxy. They then forgot to swap the names in the TB text.
There were probably 25 New Africas in FFE. The Name generator had limited words to draw from.

There are lots of stuff that doesn't match with the old games and old game lore. The Lave bubble (Old Words) used to be right next to Facece, in the Empire. It was no where near the Alliance.

These things does not really matter. It's whats in ED that matters. If ED says something happened in Zelada, it happened in Zelada. If it happened somewhere else in and old game, that's just the way it is.
