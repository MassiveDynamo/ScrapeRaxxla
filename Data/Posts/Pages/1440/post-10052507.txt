Regarding the body found floating in space at the Wreaken Construction site in Col 70 Sector, reported in Galnet in 3303, this was an in-game reference to an event in Elite Dangerous: Premonition by Drew Wagar. It has nothing to do with Raxxla, rather a conspiracy within the book.

P.S. if anyone wants a Thargoid Probe, used, 1 careful owner, then let me know before Saturday. I took my Thargoid Link and played the sound file from the Thargoid Structure in Delphi whilst in the system closest to Polaris and the link only lit up Blue and murmured a bit, it did not produce a beam or change orientation.

P.P.S. I have done a rudimentary steganographic assessment of the Raxxla and Dark Wheel Codex files and found nothing but I am outside my comfort zone in doing this and could easily have missed something. The closest-looking thing to having any meaning was to take the last word of each paragraph but that was still not giving me new information, rather it may be an artefact of the way it was written. These last words are (Raxxla Codex): Raxxla, Wheel, travel, circulation, secret, see, it, humanity, day.

Good Thargoid Probe prices at FC Silent Sphere Song (see sig). Also feel free to relax in the Bar

PS: Someone could do an in-game Raxxla talkshow directly from the bar...
