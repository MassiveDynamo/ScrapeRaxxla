The problem at this point appears to be which leads are viable? I still maintain technetium mention in "...And Here the Wheel" indicates Guardians due to S-process nucleosynthesis that is unique amongst asymptote giant branch stars. That said, chasing every anomaly in the story is getting old fast. Also, as cited in one of my post earlier it was clear Wreaken has been targeted before. The details we do have seem too sparse to give even an approximate region.
I doubt that the authors had any kind of detailed information on the Guardians, at the time the books were written. I doubt even FD had more than a general idea of how they (Guardians) were going to turn out.
There are quite a few years between the pre-release writers guide and the discovery of the Guardians.
