Personally I think it's just too much imprecise & uncertain information in the narratives & stories for the legacy versions of Elite.
No offense intended to you @CMDRCorrMorningstarFelian, I can respect how much you want to dive into and understand the background lore.
I don't mind learning / using the legacy narratives for other things. I personally doubt it has any direct influence on the Raxxla-narrative (or other 1st class narratives) in the current version.

On the question of "Wreaken / Wagar or other 3rd party author stories" - I wouldn't be surprised if FDev has aligned the plethora of intertwined stories & facts about Raxxla from Release, to Horizon, to Odyssey.
Aka changed & updated them.
As some of you've pointed out, we haven't found it yet, hence; They can freely adjust and change the implementaion with no consequence for us, except following the previous instructions given by Braben (or whoever giving the directions these days).

Arguing for this is the example of the Formidine Rift, as they Changed the POI in space to become settlement & bases.
Speaking against it is the fact that more people would be involved with this and risk for leaks increase. But this is just risk management, it can be managed. IMHO.

I've started to believe the link between the Thargoids (col70 discoveries), the Guardians and perhaps some of the Megaship(s) leading to undiscovered secrets in Col70.
It also means I have less faith with the idea "it leads to Sol" and general ancient mythology. All mythology kind of takes us back there because of their roots in folklore/stories. No offense to you other believers. o7

Bless the Permitlocks! This adventure will still last for another 2 DLC's and 6 years.
