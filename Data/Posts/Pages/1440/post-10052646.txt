It wasn't just one death. It was thousands. That Galnet ("Galactic News: Body found at Wreaken Construction Site") was major downplaying what went down
Critically from the GalNet in question it is admitted there have been several other incidents involving Wreaken. If Drew Wager mentioned Wreaken, I would be curious of the details. I know that with Mastopolos Mining in LTT 198, I suspect that they are recovering alien artifacts as there is a theocracratic faction in that system (LTT 198 Order). Text from the GalNet :


"There have been several incidents of individuals trying to break into our facilities. This is an unfortunate event, but frankly the victim brought this accident on themselves. Our facilities are secured for a reason â€“ manufacturing is a dangerous business."

Meanwhile, independent pilots have reported that Wreaken Construction sites are heavily guarded, and that approaching ships have been aggressively warned away by Wreaken-owned vessels.
