I thought that was in "..And Here the Wheel" and was directly linked to the actions of Robert Garry (grandson of Oberon Ryder):

It wasn't just one death. It was thousands. That Galnet ("Galactic News: Body found at Wreaken Construction Site") was majorly downplaying what went down.
I doubt that was in the col70 sector, while it's always hard to place locations from the novels, Col70 is extremely far away and it's clear in AHTW they are using 2b drives given the travel times they (frequently) quote.

Wreaken is absolutely mentioned, but they also do have outposts in many places. I'm not sure a bunch of pirates would travel hundreds of lightyears outside known space to attack an outpost.

Regarding the body found floating in space at the Wreaken Construction site in Col 70 Sector, reported in Galnet in 3303, this was an in-game reference to an event in Elite Dangerous: Premonition by Drew Wagar. It has nothing to do with Raxxla, rather a conspiracy within the book.
First time I've heard that. I'd be interested if you can recall the quote? It's been years since I read that one, I'd prefer not to have to re-read a Drew book
