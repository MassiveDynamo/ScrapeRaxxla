By the way, if you think about it. In what year did Braben say that there was a commander or commanders who visited the System?What is the chance that someone accidentally flew there?It's completely minimal, right?Such a commander should have "Lucky ole's Golden Balls". And I thought that if we take into account the year when he told about this event and what direction the pilots had relevant.Where did you fly often at that time?So you can minimally determine the direction of the region, sector...And has the riddle about the queen who rides a giraffe been solved?Because the essence of the riddle is not about the queen, but about the giraffe. And HD112028 is a false target, apparently...I found a star with that name today, but in a completely different system.Apparently a bug...Or not.

And why should a giraffe remember his daughter's hero?I thought about this question and flew through the systems.And I came across hd112028. This system is located in the head of the constellation.

The Camelopardis riddle was a completely unrelated event. It was solved and you can still do so yourself and find what it leads to.
