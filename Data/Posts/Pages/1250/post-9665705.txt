Not necessarily, because it could be a moving planet, rogue or fsd moved or some other tech like Thargoid/Guardian AI engines ect.... It could also be a ship of some kind, station, ect...

Then can move to objects, like Thargoid Probes, but even rarer that give your ship some kind of special abilities or who knows.....


The simple fact is, we know the art and other departments can inject new/additional content to what the Stellar Forge creates itself, so there could/very likely is, some tigger/switch/requirement (including needing the thing to actually be in the present system) that's tells the server to inject/load the Raxxla 'thing(s)'.....

But the way that quote is worded, it does imply either a movement of Raxxla, and a constant need to re-locate it, which also would align with the theory/story the DW found and then lost it ..... or it implies there is more than one.....

I'm inclined to go with it moves and can be found in several locations along some route, but not at the same time, more than that there are multiple of them.

So that would mean a ship, or station, or rogue/engine powered planet, that moves either constantly like an orbiting planet or station, or it moves periodically like a Captiol Ship/Freight Carrier could.....

And all of this would align with the quote, a journey every CMDR has to make for themselves quotes as well.....

That the journey is the most important, understanding how and why Raxxla can/does move, will lead you to be able find it every time, even if it's moving, if you can decode the clues that we supposedly have that tell us that information....
