Interesting. Ive got all star classes enabled but nothing shows in or anywhere near the cursor when I search for HD 112028. The cursor stops over empty space! And that space is (visually) only around 6ly from current location but nothing shows in the nav list at that distance.

Next time I log in Iâ€™ll have a look for your Struve 1694.
