I think he's hinting that "Place that is not a Place" is HD 112028 / HIP 62572, since if you do a Galmap search for either name it takes you to a spot in the map where no star shows. Maybe it shows in the Nav panel if you get close enough.
edit: or maybe it's a map bug?

How that solution fits all the current clues (i.e. all those in the codex Raxxla entry (Spiralling Stars, Princess Astrophel, Toast etc etc) since those old missions disappeared ages ago) is TBD!

For me finding Raxxla is far less important than the Hunt, i.e. solving the clues!
We've always actually suspected finding it would be disappointing

But a star does show...its Struve 1694 B, Crash to desktop when you jump, its not right anyways as that should be the binary second star of Struve 1694
