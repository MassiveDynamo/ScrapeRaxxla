I think he's hinting that "Place that is not a Place" is HD 112028 / HIP 62572 / HR 4893, since if you do a Galmap search for either name it takes you to a spot in the map where no star shows. Maybe it shows in the Nav panel if you get close enough.
edit: or maybe it's a map bug?

How that solution fits all the current clues (i.e. all those in the codex Raxxla entry (Spiralling Stars, Princess Astrophel, Toast etc etc) since those old missions disappeared ages ago) is TBD!

For me finding Raxxla is far less important than the Hunt, i.e. solving the clues!
We've always actually suspected finding it would be disappointing

edit2: it's a map bug, probably should be reported. Currently about 6ly away (at Col 285 Sector IU-K b10-2) and it's not showing in the nav panel. Wanted to check out some other systems in the vicinity so thought I'd check it out. Should have remembered- Do Not Feed The Troll!
