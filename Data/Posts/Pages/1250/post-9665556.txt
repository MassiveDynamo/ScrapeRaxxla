Also you might be interested to read through the FD quotes Iâ€™ve noted here https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/fdev-ed-relevant-quotes-videos.553526/#post-8671776
Just reading thru your linked quotes, and I have a question/ interesting point to make....

If "anyone can find it and more than once" is the case.... then... doesn't this imply one of the following things?

1) Raxxla does infact 'move' or change locations/systems, and isn't a static place or object in the galaxy that can be revisited in the same way each time, and would need to be "found" each time someone wants to visit, not just known where it is, even to those who have been there before.

Or

2) Raxxla exists in multiple locations, and there is not one single 'Raxxla', but in fact could be similar to guardian sites and have multiple locations across the galaxy, again, each to be found.....

Or

3) Raxxla isn't a place at all, and is in fact an object of some kind to be found, and more than one exists


Any thoughts??
