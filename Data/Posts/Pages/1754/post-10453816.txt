Good find, had forgotten about that one, so planet might be a candidate.

However my own interactions with Support identified that they utilised and quoted thirdhand information, such as Wiki, so I’m unsure of the reliability?

However, this could relate with the ‘garden design’ which if reliable, potentially describes a system and therein would seem to highlight a particular body.

To my mind the interesting thing about that diagram is that the final "body" is adjacent to a gate/way to the next garden -I'm assuming the latter is "Raxxla"!
