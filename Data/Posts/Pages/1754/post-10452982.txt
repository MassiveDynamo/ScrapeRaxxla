Why is Onionhead in game? It’s a narcotic, and by discussing it FD are engaged in PEGI 18 themes?

It originated in the system of Panem, from the Latin "bread and circuses" used to describe entertainment capitalised to distract public attention from more important matters!
Panem / Kappa Fornacis features heavily in Legacy.
It is an agricultural system that supplied Freeholm. So there may be some kind of tenuous significance?

The Genius Loci I mentioned earlier often are depicted with cornucopias. Similarly there could be a Greek / Roman mythology connection - Demeter, or Tyche / Fortuna.
