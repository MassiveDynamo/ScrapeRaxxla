Robert Holdstock said so. In "The Dark Wheel", and also in his 1980 book "The Alien World: The Complete Illustrated Guide".

In "The Dark Wheel": "Raxxla was described as a mythical planet which held an alien construct that served as a gateway to other universes. A corps of Elite-ranked pilots was suspected to have found Raxxla and exploited the gateway for their own selfish purposes, and hired assassins to eliminate any independent pilots and members of the Dark Wheel who tried to uncover Raxxla".

I ask again, why the belt cluster stuff? Genuinely curious. Belt clusters are useless usually, so what clue points to them being relevant?
BUT
Robert Holdstock didnt design or programme Elite Dangerous. We dont know how well, if at all, that original definition of Raxxla applies to Raxxla within ED. DB said we "don't know what Raxxla is", the implication of that is that Raxxla within ED may well not be a planet.

I'm still expecting a hidden Guardian ark ship, after millenia of space dust accretion probably now resembling a hollow asteroid, and undetectable until you get up close.
