Good find, hand forgotten about that one, so planet might be a candidate.

However my own interactions with Support identified that they utilised and quoted thirdhand information, such as Wiki, so I’m unsure of the reliability?

However, this could relate with the ‘garden design’ which if reliable, potentially describes a system and therein would seem to highlight a particular body.

And PLANET... Seem to remember someone pointed out the italic first part and non italic T
