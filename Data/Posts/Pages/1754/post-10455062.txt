Yes. It was originally a race of aliens, then in another work a planet, but FD has intentionally introduced doubts with their own less definitive descriptions, it ‘could be’ a planet. It ‘likely’ given the constraints of the game, is a planet or moon, but it might not be… it’s not a certainty.

I suspect it likely will be in a specific system, around a specific body, that’s based upon the in game descriptions, the locational nature of the codex clues, and ‘potential’ additional clues, such as the Garden design, which seem to sit well within a Miltonian concept; but what it ultimately is and what it does is a mystery, but I wonder given the above if it’s also a state of cosmic enlightenment, and therefore more than just a moon or planet.

This is where the writing is interesting because it might still just be an esoteric concept that can never truly be resolved. The mythology certainly around Holsdstock revolves around this concept of a Mythago ‘A myth made real and given life and being once given life it may grow and change in its own right, becoming something other than it was’.

In your link it talks of associations with Egyptian mythology, this is ultimately rather a restrictive perception which ultimately may be shaping the data to fit the source; I would advocate the concept is much much larger. I would recommend reading M Brookes initial concept of ‘The Space in between’ and then re evaluate.

But Arthur from FD did say ‘it’s big it’s been going on along time the payoff should be huge’… so this advocates it can be resolved, or will be resolvable?
