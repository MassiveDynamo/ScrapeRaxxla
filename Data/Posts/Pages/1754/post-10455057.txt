‘Raxxla’ as a creative construct, not some alien meguffin, was indeed developed as a word by Holdstock initially through ‘Alien World’ published in 1980, this predated his other work for Bell and Braben, The Dark Wheel that published in 1984.

As it’s been established, Bell and Braben did not develop the concept of Raxxla, nor the story for the DW, this was purely an invention of Holdstock who was asked to write an accompanying work for the game “that showed the basic rules of the game”.

It’s only logical that as a writer, looking for a story to flesh out, what was essentially just a short story, he would evidently like all artists, re-purpose concepts he had previously developed. It need not actually be a detailed progression of linear chronology.

This is a concept I suspect some gamers have a real difficulty contextualising, that artists sometimes just make stuff up and change things or at a granular level at least things might not mean anything.

Yes there was the Alien Worlds - but it has nothing to do with Elite Dangerous.

However, the concepts which Holdstock mined throughout his various works, do have relevance in his wider bodies of work and there is cross-over.

In Elite Dangerous, I suspect M Brookes built the current Raxxla mystery as a homage to Holdstock, with Raxxla being only one part to it, but evidently I believe, Brookes has utilised these and contextualised them in regards to Holdstocks wider concepts.

So holistically they all are relevant, but probably not chronologically, and likely not singularly.
