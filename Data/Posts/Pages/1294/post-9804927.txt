Let’s not get too hung up on ‘clouds’.

He’s talking specifically about the Large Magellanic and Small Magellanic Clouds, not clouds in some general sense.

He’s talking about them in the context of a question about whether we can go to other galaxies, because that’s what they are, other galaxies.

And they are in the game in some sense at least - you can see them in the skybox and the galaxy map.

Edit - also, I’m pretty sure he doesn’t say you can actually go to them.
