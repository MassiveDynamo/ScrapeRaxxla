Its also been stated that someone has already flown into the System where Raxla is, honked and carried on without scanning the Planet.

This is commonly repeated but there's zero proof it was ever said. There's hearsay of hearsay from one guy who claims that it was supposedly said in a Q&A session, but nobody has ever been able to find evidence that it actually happened.
