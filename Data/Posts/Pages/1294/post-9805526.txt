This is commonly repeated but there's zero proof it was ever said. There's hearsay of hearsay from one guy who claims that it was supposedly said in a Q&A session, but nobody has ever been able to find evidence that it actually happened.
Just wanted to point out...It's not hearsay... It's a video where he claims it happened and he was in the room according to the claim... Hearsay would be if his mate said "my mate said...". It's a claim no one else to my knowledge has corroborated... And as time goes by its less likely to be corroborated in my view.... So whilst you may discount it as him making it up, he said he witnessed the conversation personally... A first hand account and evidence, how reliable it is, is the question... The video is on the first post if you wanted to see him make the claim in person...
