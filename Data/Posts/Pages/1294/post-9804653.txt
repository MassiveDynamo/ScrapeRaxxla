Well, when you watch this video you can see him pause before he answers that specific question. He says, it is possible but unnecessary to go to another galaxy, almost like he meant to say, there is a place in the galaxy that is not part of the galaxy and then he continues about some clouds that are in the game which maybe irrelevant.
