anyone else playing Horizons having problems?
After the Taurus mining CG got back to Jameson, picked up my hangar & SRV from Outfitting storage, got to my destination, moved out in the SRV, to find I cant use either the data link scanner (doesnt even show on screen when turret deployed) nor the gun. Both are enabled in weapon groups & both have power enabled. Logged out to desktop & back into game, still not working.
Weird!
Looks like finger trouble with option settings!
Though how the srv fire primary/secondary controls got unbound I have no idea!!!
