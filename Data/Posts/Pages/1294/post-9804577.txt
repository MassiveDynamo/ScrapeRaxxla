Possibly not relevant but I do believe people have patterns of communication / tells; anyways just happened across this very old vid of David Braben at EGX 2014.

Close to the end he answers some Q/A and one is ‘can we travel to the centre of the galaxy and what’s there’ type question.

How DB answers I find interesting. Because he illiterates the core at that time was not in game (but would be post launch, as they were still in a beta bubble, but he says firstly how uninteresting it would be, and too far away!

But the biggest tell was when he simply answered “it’s already in game” (when it wasn’t) - you can go there “it’s in the galaxy map”.

That type of answer I find interesting, especially if expanded to his answer to Drew, that Raxxla was in game. It goes back to the suspicion, that R can be in game, even have a location, whilst at the same time not being accessible in game, because: it’s either lore; it’s in a mission text; it’s in the codex (now); or it’s in the narrative etc.

I know it’s splitting hairs, but something to be mindful about.
