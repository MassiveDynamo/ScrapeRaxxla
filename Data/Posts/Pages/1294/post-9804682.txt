Possibly not relevant but I do believe people have patterns of communication / tells; anyways just happened across this very old vid of David Braben at EGX 2014.

Close to the end he answers some Q/A and one is ‘can we travel to the centre of the galaxy and what’s there’ type question.

How DB answers I find interesting. Because he illiterates the core at that time was not in game (but would be post launch, as they were still in a beta bubble, but he says firstly how uninteresting it would be, and too far away!

But the biggest tell was when he simply answered “it’s already in game” (when it wasn’t) - you can go there “it’s in the galaxy map”.

That type of answer I find interesting, especially towards his answer to Drew, that Raxxla was in game. It goes back to the suspicion, that R can be in game, but at the same time not, because: it’s lore; because it’s in a mission text; it’s in the codex (now); or it’s in the narrative.

I know it’s splitting hairs, but something to be mindful about.

Well, when you watch this video you can see him pause before he answers that specific question. He says, it is possible but unnecessary to go to another galaxy, almost like he meant to say, there is a place in the galaxy that is not part of the galaxy and then he continues about some clouds that are in the game which maybe irrelevant.
Its also been stated that someone has already flown into the System where Raxla is, honked and carried on without scanning the Planet.
