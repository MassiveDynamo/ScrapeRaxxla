Its also been stated that someone has already flown into the System where Raxla is, honked and carried on without scanning the Planet.
We do not know that Raxxla is a planet, that is pure assumption (it was a planet in Holdstock’s original novella, and in Wagar’s fan fiction books, but none of that is known to be canonical for ED), in fact we know nothing about it at all-DB has said so
All we have been told about Raxxla is:
that it is a definite location in the game world (not text) and not random
It is very hard to find
Anyone can find it and more than once
it is in the Milky Way.

True, there is a rumour that an FD employee (allegedly MB) said in a closed Q&A session that the system containing Raxxla had been visited and honked but Raxxla was not detected. However we only have one source for that rumour, and it is unsubstantiated. Moreover that rumour tells us absolutely nothing about what Raxxla may be nor where it may be!
