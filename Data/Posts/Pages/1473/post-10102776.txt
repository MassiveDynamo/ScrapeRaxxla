My point is this: claiming everything from a known propagandist is true is fundamentally insane. For the record, The Pilot's Federation doesn't have a much better track record. That is why I am insisting on evidence. Let's be mature enough to show evidence for why a viewpoint should be considered and the one with better evidence is the one you follow. I was unkind to Canonn Science when I left because they disavowed all older lore (or at least certain moderators did). I don't want that to repeat. Friendships aren't worth sacrificing for a game with convoluted lore. Let's be good for each other and find a way through this.
