There were plenty of dictatorships in the original Elite. Planets were either democracy, corporate state, dictatorship or anarchy.
Galcop didn't govern any planets. They were entirely space based and administered the stations and system security. Each planet (there was only one in each system) had it's individual government or controlling group.

It is from Oolite, but an exact copy of the original game.

Edit: Lave is planet 7
