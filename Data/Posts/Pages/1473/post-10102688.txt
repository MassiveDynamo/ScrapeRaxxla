In Elite there weren't any named dictators.
There are books, multiple RPGs, codexes, GalNet, etc. Each game frequently covered ground that the prior didn't. If that bit of propaganda matters so much, I am sure you can source something that would actually back the claim of prior dictators in Lave. I however suspect this is not backed by lore. Elite's Universe and the larger series is not like most games. Nothing is ever exactly as it seems on the surface.

I thought y'all wanted the old lore? Having a change of heart?
