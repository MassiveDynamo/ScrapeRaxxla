The game first started in August 3174 when Walden's reign of terror began.That doesn't prove anything. Just that we know Lave was a dictatorship during Walden. That same thing is in the first manual. There are no references to a dictatorship in Lave until August 3174. This was after GalCop collapses, after GCS Saravasti, after Thargoids had left in 3151 per GalNet and GCS Saravasti. So, care to explain that?

Oh and THARG was they to a hidden message to CMDRs about interaction with the aliens.

The first game starts in 3125. You literally plays as commander Jameson, that dies in the mycoid attack that ends the First Thargoid war.
3174 is after the war ended. I have no idea where you got the 3174 start date from.
