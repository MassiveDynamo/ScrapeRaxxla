Please cite evidence for any claims. I have always done the same. I will not be responding to posts which do not cite evidence. I am here to help and will do so if you put in the research. I am not willing to sacrifice my sanity on posts that cannot honestly deal with the sheer amount of misdirection inherent in the lore. Lave was just a particularly egregious example. The manual for the first game has in-service dates. You can then construct appropriate start date based on ships in TDW novella, events, etc. Do not blindly parrot what you have been told.
