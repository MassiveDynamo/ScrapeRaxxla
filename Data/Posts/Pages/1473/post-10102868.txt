Would it be helpful if I write up a document for my claim of post-First Thargoid War? I just don't want this to devolve into stupid fighting. I have made mistakes about how I responded to Canonn Science and don't want those mistakes repeated. The case is actually fairly solid. Understanding where it starts is key to getting through this.
The timing of the old game is’t that important. What happened there isn’t lore until FD confirms it, in ED.
Even then it’s often self contradicting and has loose ends.
This is partly on purpose, to give FD the option to change the past and partly just poor proof reading.

We read the old lore in case the author has left secret hints to the local of Raxxla

I’m still interested in your post war hypothesis.
