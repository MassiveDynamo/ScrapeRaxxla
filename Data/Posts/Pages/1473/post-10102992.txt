Guardians won the war and drove out the Thargoids, they didn't wipe them out?

Guardians were wiped out by their AI mainly and the few survivors died out over time?
I didn't put this point as 2 for nothing. Read about point 1.
You can't win a war if all of the Guardian technology goes to zero when you encounter the Thargoids.
Fly to the vortexes and you'll see what I mean.
