Literally, any system referencing prior dictators in Lave will suffice. If Lave was a dictatorship ship even longer than Walden the evidence should be in the lore somewhere. Books, etc. Like I said I am aware of no such claims except in direct reference to Walden himself.
In Elite there weren't any named dictators. The game had literally no memory to spare for fluff like that. Government type was a variable for the planets. Lave was a dictatorship agricultural world with a tech level of 5.

Those variables in my last post were all there was.
