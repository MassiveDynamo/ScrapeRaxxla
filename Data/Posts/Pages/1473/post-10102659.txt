Citation please (and no Walden is not an acceptable source).

All available evidence suggests both the Old Worlds Coalition and Galactic Cooperative were unshockingly cooperatives. Dictators historically have twisted the perception of the past in order to further secure their grip on power. Further, the misinformation campaigns often start before they are in power. If it was an external source to Lave, it might have credence but we don't have anything like that to my knowledge. This is after all the unmitigated of a human who hoisted the term Thargoid on humanity when the region survived the "First Thargoid War" when the region was explicitly banned from having any military by the Imperials following the Morten-Marte Incident in 2498. More information about that here: https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Old_Worlds

There were plenty of dictatorships in the original Elite. Planets were either democracy, corporate state, dictatorship or anarchy.
Galcop didn't govern any planets. They were entirely space based and administered the stations and system security. Each planet (there was only one in each system) had it's individual government or controlling group.

All the systems in galaxy 1 is listed here, with stats and description: https://wiki.alioth.net/index.php/Oolite_planet_list/Galaxy_1

It is from Oolite, but an exact copy of the original game.

Edit: Lave is planet 7
