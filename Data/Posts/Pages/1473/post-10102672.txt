# 7. Lave (20,173), {39,46,55,129,147,255} within 7.0 LY. Radius 4116 km.Dictatorship, Rich Agri. Pop. 2.5 B, Prod. 7000 MCr. HC: 6, TL: 5, Human Colonials.Lave is most famous for its vast rain forests and the Laveian tree grub.
The game first started in August 3174 when Walden's reign of terror began.That doesn't prove anything. Just that we know Lave was a dictatorship during Walden. That same thing is in the first manual. There are no references to a dictatorship in Lave until August 3174. This was after GalCop collapses, after GCS Saravasti, after Thargoids had left in 3151 per GalNet and GCS Saravasti. So, care to explain that?

Oh and THARG was they to a hidden message to CMDRs about interaction with the aliens.



Deciphered text (that I personally broke):

Lavian Phoenix Greeting Protocol

The old mercenaries preferred a silent hail when meeting in deep space . Approach dead ahead with gun ports open at ninety degrees to target. Stop at five hundred metres , rotate ninety to the left and wait for same response.

Once established, custom is Phoenix members help each other. Your new friend might fly your wing for a while, but they’ll be gone if something comes up.

No pilot violates the greeting. If they does, let it be know. The Lady of Fate don’t smile on traitors.
