This is why I warned people they may not be happy about what they find. Apex Interstellar uses Adders because the whole of the Pilots' Federation is one giant criminal syndicate.

The Adder was developed by Outworld Workshop with rights then acquired by Zorgon Peterson to cover up it's history (it even has the infamous foldable wings). The Krait and Mamba was similarly illicitly developed. This is all in-game on ship purchase screen.
