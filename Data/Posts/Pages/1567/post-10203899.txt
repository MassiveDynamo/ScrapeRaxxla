Itâ€™s possibly they are all dead (In my opinion) and their station a dead hulk, but with recordings giving more hints
Ortiz Moreno City in Tau Ceti is the station type made by competitor to Brewer Corporation. This is covered in the last paragraph of the Brewer Corporation codex. There are tons of others throughout the Bubble including such examples as Black Mausoleum in Beta Hydri, Mars High in Sol, Wicca Town in Gateway, and Irkutsk in Alioth amongst others. This also includes Trade Post in Delta Phoenicis where the Delta Phoenicis Palms originate. Merritt Group made the stations. They are very much in use to this day (even Ortiz Moreno City was ultimately repaired).

The Dark Wheel is who you'd expect: Engineers (Jameson, Ryder, Turner and all the others) and members of the Elite Pilot's Federation. The reason Shinrarta Dezra has never been shutdown is it is very legitimate. So, yes, Farseer's comments that she has never met them is a lie.
