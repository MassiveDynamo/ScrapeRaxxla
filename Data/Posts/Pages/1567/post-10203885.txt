The old games didn't have engineering or powerplay. They were also single player games, with saves. If you died, you you reloaded.
There was the option to use escape pods, but they were practically pointless.
Are you sure this wasn't some other game?
Yep, I'm sure. Some content was in Elite+ and some in alphas that never saw public release.
