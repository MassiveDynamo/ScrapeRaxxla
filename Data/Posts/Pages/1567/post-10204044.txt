3114 this base was some how 'tested' by researchers at Nesbitt Landing, Alioth demonstrating substantial innovations in robotic manufacture and production. This seems odd to me and to name the station and system so specifically? Worth a visit.
One word: Mycoid

The oldest INRA are Imperial Navy Research Arm and Imperial Navy Reserve Arm. This is where that weird discrepancy in dates comes in where Mycoid originated before 3193 when Intergalactic Naval Reserve Arm is founded. See attachment for overview on the real history here.

From the Alioth entry on Frontier gazetteer:
The enormous hydrocarbon resources made available by the large number of gas giants, as well as the primary star of the system have led to a huge plastics industry based at this system. The scientists of Nesbitt Landing introduced the quinker process and led to a revolution in robot production techniques. They still lead the Federation in many aspects of design and production of automata, especially androids. These products are highly sought after amongst the Empire worlds.

Don't bother going to Alioth. Nesbitt is a surface site at an Earth-like that isn't accessible at present. Also, the Alliance evicted Achilles Corporation which is now in Thule. This appears to be one of those cases where anything AI or robotics was discontinued because apparently we are terrified of awaking the Guardian AI. Curiously, in the last 35 years of Walden's reign the Alliance pivots to clones and genetic technology. In addition to being friends of the Imperial Royal family, I think at least Argent worked with Walden. Oh look who caretakes over that region - Alioth.
