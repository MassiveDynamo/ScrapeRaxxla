I’ve always thought that name of “Omphalos Infotech” was a hint. Maybe fits my theory that PF (& UC) involve a Guardian/AI....but wonder why it was then changed to “Unified Infotech”.

Still not fit to fly, spent most of yesterday afternoon asleep....
The PF is basically our union. Still we don't know how it works.
The biggest mystery is how our instant escape pods work. Even more so, when we are in an SRV or on foot.
It's not like we get kidnapped by Thargoids, when they destroy our ship either.
