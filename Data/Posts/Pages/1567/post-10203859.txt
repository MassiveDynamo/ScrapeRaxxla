Something like that. It was sacrifice yourself and your ship to a star 3 times. I seem to recall each ship needed to have been used for at least 1 mission. It also required a minimum of one ship worth more than 1MCr, including engineered and powerplay modules. You may have needed to be carrying some valuable cargo and H.E. suits.
Please don't do that. Propaganda to work has to be believable. Starship One and Antares were the stories to give legitimacy to his sham story of misjumping to Colonia. Both those ships used Hydrogen fuel and they are the same core tech as our ships which cannot misjump. The closest thing is cutting power right before jump or an emergency abort. Antares and Starship One likely involved explosives to make it seem plausible. Meanwhile, Jaques is anchored to the floors of Peter's Base.
