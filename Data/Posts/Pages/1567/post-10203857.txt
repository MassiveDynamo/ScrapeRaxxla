Something like that. It was sacrifice yourself and your ship to a star 3 times. I seem to recall each ship needed to have been used for at least 1 mission. It also required a minimum of one ship worth more than 1MCr, including engineered and powerplay modules. You may have needed to be carrying some valuable cargo and H.E. suits.
The old games didn't have engineering or powerplay. They were also single player games, with saves. If you died, you you reloaded.
There was the option to use escape pods, but they were practically pointless.
Are you sure this wasn't some other game?
