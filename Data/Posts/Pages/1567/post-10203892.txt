I'm happy to go unbelieved.

It's not something I expect anyone else to attempt to be honest, so currently I'm testing this particular easter egg myself. It involves making repeated one-way trips to Colonia (redacted). My memory of some details is vague and it's likely to involve repeats of the process to get it right.

...and that's assuming it's in this version of the game.
