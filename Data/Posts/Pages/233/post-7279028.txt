Been following this thread with some interest. It's an impressive ball of tinfoil, very majestic.

I don't have much to add but I like the whole mythology thing that's running amok. In regards to the Omphalos Rift, according to the myth as I get it, one of the Omphalos stones was dropped at Dephi after two eagles met head on. The other was given to Cronus to keep him from eating his son, Zeus. Cronus had previously eaten his father, Uranus, with similar goals (get/stay in power).

I've been to Delphi. Hung out on the Oracle, even read Galnet. The moon below the station was a dead end for me.

I went to Zeta Cassiopeia. I went to see the lifeforms on the only two landable moons. Lovely star, but that was all I found. I feel that one constellation drawing was quite a find but perhaps a red herring, probably unintentional though.

/: pulls out two small swatches of tinfoil :/

The myth has it that the one Omphalos stone was placed at Delphi where the eagles met, in the middle. There is an Eagle Nebula, and an Aquila (Eagle) Dark Region. From what I have calculated, the spot that lies equidistant to them falls in an area between the arms where it's somewhat thinner on stars (The Omphalos Rift?). I'm heading out there now, got nothing better to do.

The other Omphalos was given to Cronus. Cronus searched in the galmap leads to the system Elysia, and it's in the bubble, supporting any pre-FSD theories I'm absorbing. Haven't been there either. Most likely this idea just stems from acute tinfoil poisoning.

edit:

Cronus is a terraformed world in Elysia. I was checking out the five human signals on its one landable moon but I had a Vulture drive off my xploro-tincan-aconda. Seemed unremarkable from what I've seen.

Carry on, o7
