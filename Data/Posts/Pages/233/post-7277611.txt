Where would you guys situate "the brow of the Galaxy" ? ( as you saw, teribble Anglich, here...)
As seen from Sol ? Polaris ?
As seen from a view from above the MW ? Most distant star sitting at the roof above Sgr A* ?

you can’t really see the Milky Way galaxy ‘cos you’re in it! Hence it must be an external galaxy; someone has already pointed out the links between Perseus, Andromeda (a very visible external galaxy!), and Cassiopea (the mother of andromeda?) and the jewel on her brow....

do pay attention Scytale, you’re falling behind!
