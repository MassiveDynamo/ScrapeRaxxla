Haven't been there lately or looked for clues there. I'll drop by when I get time to play.

I think Michael Brookes might have been literal, when he told us, 'it's a journey'. As in Raxxla is literally a journey(odyssey).

The other stars of Gemini may also be worth a check. They are all Gem(s).
Hmm, I guess for younger explorers Raxxla is the New and Tasty. Wait, wrong odyssey...

But, yeah. I see where your going with that thought. Raxxla is a place but, not a place. The codex calls it a place as well.

What if it is a state of being? A state of enlightenment giving you access to travel between universes and great foresight. A way of viewing the universe through a different lens, as it were. It would explain why you'd need to make the journey yourself as no one can guide you to 'Raxxla', just as no one can guide you to 'Nirvana' (or the equivalent).

I'm not saying we totally toss out the science or research here. Just keep an open mind to this. It could be like the situation in Arrival where a new way of thinking allows a species to experience non-linear time. In Raxxla's case this would give access to the Omphalos Rift instead.

This would explain why even the knowledge is kept secret and all who know are killed. You can control a place, you can't control a concept.
