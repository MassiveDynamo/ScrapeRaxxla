CMDRs, before I go and do something expensive, has anyone worked with Recon limpets?

I have an orbital installation I want to "debrief", but I have no experience with this type of op. Will going dark prevent retaliation? I'm thinking the 3E recon controller. Just want to borrow some of their comms
...

Update: going dark did help a bit, transmitters gave only data mats, maintenance hatch led inside to nothing; a very tight squeeze for an Orca, for sure!
