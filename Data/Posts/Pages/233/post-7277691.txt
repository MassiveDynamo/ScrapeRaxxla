Yeah... you, as often, are right Herr Professor-Doktor . But every time I open the GalMap, I can see the whole MW. Try it !
I meant a star in the above outer rim of the MW.
Not so far away as extra-galactical bodies/clusters etc... Purely "geographical", no myths here.
It's just my "Six Bridges" tinfoil based on the Codex icon..

If you want an extra-galactical chalenge, I have one.

The background stars in the system map are the same for all systems. From Beagle point to the FRift, it stays the same.

Are they just coloured dots or are they light sources outside the galaxy?

If they are galaxies, they could give us a direction.
