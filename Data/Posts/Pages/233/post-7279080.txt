The myth has it that the one Omphalos stone was placed at Delphi where the eagles met, in the middle. There is an Eagle Nebula, and an Aquila (Eagle) Dark Region. From what I have calculated, the spot that lies equidistant to them falls in an area between the arms where it's somewhat thinner on stars (The Omphalos Rift?). I'm heading out there now, got nothing better to do.

Get that Cmdr a drink, possibly wrapped in tin-foil.

What a great write up.
