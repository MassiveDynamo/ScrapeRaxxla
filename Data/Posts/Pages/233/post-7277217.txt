Its extremely likely the older DW missions were just this, those got dropped for an undisclosed reason / possible bugged following an update. FD never confirmed directly what happened only something was in game....

That's not true regarding the missions, we know that they weren't migrated to the updated mission system of 2.1. Prior to that they vanished in 1.5/2.0 ("Ships"/"Horizons") when an update intended to restrict them to "the Founders World".
I personally got the information when 2.1 went live that they hadn't been added, and Adam said they'd only had time to add a couple of standard 'Elite or Founder' missions types but with higher payouts. There's more detail here about the history. (linked on post #1 also)

I've been asking quite regularly after them ever since in livestreams and did so again in the 3.3 stream last week when Dom was a guest.
They still haven't been migrated and for what ever reason, FD still choose to take the "we have nothing to talk about" line regarding them.
See post #4484.
