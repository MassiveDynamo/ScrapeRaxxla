Excellent job Jorki,

I'm on route back to the loop following a distraction, I have a hunch about a locality, so I think I'll get out the graph paper and do this the old fashioned way and eye-ball it with planar triangles and pattern recognition - insane but fun...

NOT after 2+ months of it I can assure you!

edit: beginning to think “Raxxla” is Guardian for
” exhausted...
seeing spots before my eyes...
dreaming of star patterns when asleep...
need intravenous Lavian brandy...
Instruct the AI to go genetically seed Lave so we’ll (eventually) get some!”
