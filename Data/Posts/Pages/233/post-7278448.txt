Regarding the jewel on the brow, the head of Nut is in Gemini. Nut is the cosmic Mother of Egyptian mythology.


The brightest star in Gemini is Castor, also known as 'Î± Gem' (Alpha Gemini).

Have you been there yet? I've been to the full Gemini constellation, pre-mapping probes.
I'd really like to see you come up with something here. I think it's a good angle, but we need to make it connect to the clues in the codex.
I know that Pollux has a Listening Post that contains the French poem, Chanson d'automne. This was the broadcast on the radio for the French Resistance to start their operations on D-Day. If I recall, it was for a fallen CMDR. I can;t see much eelse in the system. It has several gg's and some landables.

Castor has 2 Class A and 4 Class M stars and some degraded emissions, nothing else from what I see.
