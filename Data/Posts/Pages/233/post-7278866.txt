Have you been there yet? I've been to the full Gemini constellation, pre-mapping probes.
I'd really like to see you come up with something here. I think it's a good angle, but we need to make it connect to the clues in the codex.
I know that Pollux has a Listening Post that contains the French poem, Chanson d'automne. This was the broadcast on the radio for the French Resistance to start their operations on D-Day. If I recall, it was for a fallen CMDR. I can;t see much eelse in the system. It has several gg's and some landables.

Castor has 2 Class A and 4 Class M stars and some degraded emissions, nothing else from what I see.

Haven't been there lately or looked for clues there. I'll drop by when I get time to play.

I think Michael Brookes might have been literal, when he told us, 'it's a journey'. As in Raxxla is literally a journey(odyssey).

The other stars of Gemini may also be worth a check. They are all Gem(s).
