Interesting, though might simply be part of the background simulation signifying nothing.

Am through with checking Avalon. Nothing found even with our new "eyes". Currently on my way to Mintaka to follow up the theory that the star in the start screen might be one of the orionis stars. Will tell if I find anything.

Some tinfoilery besides: "the parents grief/lovers woe" part might relate to Ishtar/Astarte who was at the same time Mother and lover of the god Tammuz or Dumuzi who was annually slain and the given birth again in springtime. There is as system called Ishtar, haven't visited as of yet.
