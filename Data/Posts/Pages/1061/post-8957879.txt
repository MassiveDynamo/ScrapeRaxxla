Ok, so....the reason we may not be making much progress on their exploration data is most likely due to them adding more and more each time that we dont know about? Seems very bad considering there is enough to explore in Elite for centuries as is :-( As for the Raxxla topic so they could be potentially adding and removing this planet from system to system each Thursday provided it is not included in the current line of star orbits.......
They are not 'shuffeling the deck' IMO That would be a nightmare for any database , I dont think they can remove entries , only append at the end of a 'list'. If Raxxla does jump around like the nexus from trek it would be its own mechanic. I think its very rare when something is actually added because of how the forge was created.
