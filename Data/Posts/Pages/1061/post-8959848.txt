The Martian Artefact is "no bigger than child's hand"

Quoting from the Cobblestone Museums Website:
" What is a cobblestone?

The word ‘cobblestone’ comes from the Middle English ‘cobelston’. The word came from ‘cob’ meaning a rounded lump and ‘stone’ meaning just what it means today. Geologists classify cobblestones as being 64-256 mm or 2.5 in to 10.1 in. In lay terms, a cobblestone is a stone that can be held in one hand."

A cobble is the size of an Adults hand... What is smaller than a Cobble?

A Pebble...

Quoting from the Online Etymology Dictionary:
"Historically there is no precise definition based on size other than that it is smaller than a cobble."

So the Martian Artifact could be described as Pebble Sized...

I find it interesting that the words Raxxla and Pebble have a similar structure to them... I can only think of a couple six letter words that have the same structure as Raxxla.
Does this mean there is a connection? Is Raxxla... A Pebble-Sized object found on Mars?


The other word I can think of is Nirrti
