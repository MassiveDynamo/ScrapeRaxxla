Hey you had fun, I had fun following the story, everyone wins

The search for Raxxla is lots of fun theories but usually...
No! This is no longer about fun! This is personal between us and that sensor evading son of a witch!

But, seriously; the Dark Wheel's Raxxla-toast seems to be a series of actions in the galactic map which I must have done correctly on Thursday. This was mentioned as a possibility in this very thread, but I'm not going to go through all 1000 pages...
At the same time I need to exclude other options and test, test, test. The goal is now to find out when "veil north" works, this discovery is really significant.

My fear currently is that "veil north" is a one off, meaning it only works once for your character... There is precedent for this game mechanic: CQC prestige.
