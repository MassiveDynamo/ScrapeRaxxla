heres another theory to blow your mind, what if raxxla is the mars relic.....the size no smaller than a childs hand is an acorn...wait for it.

An omphalos is a religious stone artifact the shape looks like a weird acorn.

The original game was first used and produced by acornsoft

and there you have it, the omphalos rift, the acorn/raxxla is a rift between the time of the original Elite and now ;-)

@drew when the thinfoil is wrapped around my head to hard lol
