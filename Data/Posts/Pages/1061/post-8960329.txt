I'm interested in Sifi KO-G b24-5 right now. Will be starting today.
When you're there, check both your Nav panel and the galactic map. If there is anything in the Nav panel that stands out, jump to it, and make a thorough search. Check the system map and the Orrery, look at all values.

I'm back in the bubble and I will be trying to recreate the steps I have done on Thursday.
