I think we are now up to 0.5% And keep in mind, EDSM only accounts for PC players running EDD or the like. Add in Console CMDR's and PC CMDR's not running third party tools....well, 0.015 times three is 0.045...so there's that.
It seems unlikely. I think the last figure we got from FD was 0.042 towards the end of 2019 (apparently from 0.036 at the beginning of that year) :

From 0.036% to 0.042%, this year saw Commanders edging ever closer to 1% of the galaxy being explored! Do you have any plans to go exploring and help raise that number throughout 2020? Tell us in the comments below! pic.twitter.com/3tYD8cLvjK

I doubt that 10 times as much will have been explored in the past year than had been in the previous 5 years combined.


Yes, the majority of players are unlikely to use EDSM, but I suspect the takeup is significantly higher among the more active explorers, so I think the 3x figure of EDSM is probably still a similar parity. As for consoles, I'm sure I read somewhere that they made up perhaps a third of the playerbase, and I think even they can also link accounts to EDSM now.
