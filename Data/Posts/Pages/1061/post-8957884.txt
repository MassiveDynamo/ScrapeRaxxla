Histroically FD have intervened to stop the player base chasing ghosts (referring to the Gan Romero storyline in particular) so the fact that they haven't done that with Raxxla, is an encouragement.
In all fairness...."historically" is a bit of a leap. More like "Finally." Gan Romero was the drop that overflowed the glass, I think.
