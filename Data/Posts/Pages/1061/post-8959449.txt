Today, there was nothing, no joy.

I traveled back to the system where "veil north" worked yesterday, but nothing. It must have been sheer luck that I was at the right time at the right position, but I somehow don't believe this. The chances are astronomical!

I expect that "Raxxla" or let's call it "The Witch" will return next thursday and I guess that "veil north" will work then again. But I don't expect it in the same system as yesterday.

The reason why I think that thursday will work is the following:



The closest system to "Witch's Reach" is "Donner" which is the German name for thunder. And as we all know, Donnerstag = Thursday = Thor's day.
I have a feeling that the names of the week days may be used to predict the position of the witch. My hunch is not without merit: This would explain the extra 's' in Odins, when we think of Odin's day = Wednesday. Perhaps the other Norse deities are involved in the position of the witch.

But for now: If I manage to make "veil north" work next Thursday again, then it's the real deal.

And I hope I can persuade you to take part in "Operation Baba Yaga":

When, during a jump between two systems, you notice the stars spinning/swirling violently, then please do the following:


My assumption is that the target system of "veil north" is not Raxxla, but it is somewhere on the route.

Donner system was named after Jack Donner from star trek just to let you know ;-)
