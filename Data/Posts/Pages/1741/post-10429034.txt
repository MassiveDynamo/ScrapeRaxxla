Dont!
Well, i'm not giving up or anything. But...well... i guess i'm just very confused by FDev's decision to supposedly remove prior 'trinkets' and 'Dark Wheel' missions? Like, why? Just don't understand why remove something that's still revered & referred within the Codex? Was it because they had to make space ( pun intended ) for the THARGOIDS ??

The DW and Raxxla in a game are unique, its addictive,
Agreed , however.... For example: Couple days ago , while searching systems, i just happened to have some Tritium in my cargo hold and stumbled upon what i thought was a "secret" system showing The Dark Wheel as the faction ( on lower left corner info screen next to object hologram ) .

I thought: "wow i finally discovered something unique!" -- Then, seconds later, i get interdicted ( cuz of the Tritium ) by a ship that i target and i notice it has red WANTED....and.... The Dark Wheel listed. So i think: "whoa maybe this is what the Codex entry talks about with surviving a suitable test of courage & skill..."

Very fun. Very mysterious. Very cool. Right?

Well, then as i'm about to post the screenshots ( all excited lol ) i find that earlier post from @Ian Doncaster ...and my bubble ( another pun sorry lol ) bursts , since his post i quoted leads me to check the 'Inara' site and i see there's actually a bunch of 'Dark Wheel' faction systems already. ( which means i didn't discover anything unique after all )

So i dunno.... i'm just confused really. But maybe that's what FDev wants? And maybe, as the saying goes, ignorance truly is bliss?
