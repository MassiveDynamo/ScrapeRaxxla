The original state of Shinrarta Dezhra contained a "Pilots Federation" faction and the "Dark Wheel" faction;

Whether or not the Dark Wheel faction in Shinrarta is "the real Dark Wheel", it's certainly not a player-created faction. It has of course been adopted by various players over the years,
Wait a second , are u guys saying that all of these 'The Dark Wheels' listed here--> https://inara.cz/elite/nearest-stat...&pi7=0&pi23=0&pi6=0&ps3=The+Dark+Wheel&pi24=0 ... are totally fake and possibly just PLAYER made? ( player named , player manipulated, player spread, etc. )

As in, there is absolutely no point nor purpose in wasting time doing missions for those ^ faction in relation to the mysterious Codex entry?

Asking for a friend.
