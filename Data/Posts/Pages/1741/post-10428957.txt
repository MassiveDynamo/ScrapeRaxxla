My musing was that for a new player and I'm of the Opinion someone that has just joined the game should be able to find Raxxla without any outside research (just my thoughts).

Im just trying now to look at everything from an 'In-game' perspective, not what is outside or 'the real world'

Yes, this is exactly what I did!

I assume Brookes created the mystery to be resolved mostly in game - like all the other puzzles - no digging into out of game ancient myth or outside sources necessary (but it can add context).

This also keeps it accessible across languages and locations (for example: you don't need to try to find a copy of a medieval english sonnet in your native language, or buy copies of out-of-print books by a semi-obscure british 70s author to try to solve part of an easter egg).
