Wait a second , are u guys saying that all of these 'The Dark Wheels' listed here--> https://inara.cz/elite/nearest-stat...&pi7=0&pi23=0&pi6=0&ps3=The+Dark+Wheel&pi24=0 ... are totally fake and possibly just PLAYER made? ( player named , player manipulated, player spread, etc. )

As in, there is absolutely no point nor purpose in wasting time doing missions for those ^ faction in relation to the mysterious Codex entry?

Asking for a friend.
My musing was that for a new player and I'm of the Opinion someone that has just joined the game should be able to find Raxxla without any outside research (just my thoughts).
Looking at the system information regarding factions there is no way to tell if its Player made or not, would a new player be expected to know the difference?
Therefore after reading the codex you could assume that the DW faction in SD is possibly the one we are looking for (and yes the codex hints it may not be).
Also from a roleplay perspective as all factions are in effect run by 'people' if you don't break immersion then every faction is technically a player (in game).
To the game world there is no Player and Non player they are all part of the galaxy.

Im just trying now to look at everything from an 'In-game' perspective, not what is outside or 'the real world'
