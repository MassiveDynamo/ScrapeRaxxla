Right here's another head scratcher then whilst we are on the Station.
Again just following in game stuff we learn that the Brewer Corporation have been making Coriolis stations since 2752.
It says the second design was the Orbis (possible toroid).
BUT Cora talks about Raxxla in 2296, is this before the DW existed as the codex also talks about the DW faction in SD forming in 3300.

Its the station thing that's killing me because way back in the first game it said that the first ever station (built by Galactic Astronautic and Space Exploration Centre) was around Lave also in 2752.
Were there no space stations before that then? where and when did the DW set up?

What i am trying to establish is the extent that humanity had travelled (and set up a station) when Cora said those infamous words.
This will narrow my new search.
