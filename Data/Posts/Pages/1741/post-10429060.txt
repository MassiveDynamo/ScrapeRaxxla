Wait a second , are u guys saying that all of these 'The Dark Wheels' listed here--> https://inara.cz/elite/nearest-stat...&pi7=0&pi23=0&pi6=0&ps3=The+Dark+Wheel&pi24=0 ... are totally fake and possibly just PLAYER made? ( player named , player manipulated, player spread, etc. )
So:
- the faction "The Dark Wheel" was placed in the game by Frontier, in the Shinrarta Dezhra system, as one of the 70,000ish factions they added at the start of the game. It's reasonable to think that they exercised slightly more care over its naming and placement than they did over the Tau Ceti Crimson Boys
- any station that faction owns in Shinrarta Dezhra itself was also given to it by Frontier
- there are limitations above and beyond the normal ones on what BGS activity can take place in Shinrarta, but these don't preclude factions within that system expanding; all the instances of "The Dark Wheel" are the same faction originally placed by Frontier so are all either "fake" or "real"
- there is so far no evidence that "The Dark Wheel" faction behaves any differently to any other faction in how it responds to player activity within the systems it's present in; this was always intended to have the galaxy change over time, it's just the level of opinionatedness that players have over which factions should be present in which systems that Frontier didn't anticipate originally.
- the vast majority of "The Dark Wheel" faction presence and station ownership outside Shinrarta has indeed been deliberately done by players in the hope that this would unlock something. (it hasn't)

It's not possible to tell the difference at the moment between the following scenarios:
- the Dark Wheel faction is entirely a red herring when it comes to the mysteries, or at least it serves no more purpose than a bit of background flavour for the Shinrarta system
- the Dark Wheel faction has some significance, but as it was never intended to be present outside Shinrarta, its presence elsewhere is irrelevant to the mysteries
- the "Turning the Wheel" player project was right that something interesting would happen if the faction was present in a particular system outside Shinrarta, but has so far been wrong about which system. (Still, as with everything else, ruling out lines of enquiry is also valuable!)
