Thanks mate, ive just stumbled across your comment in the thread re Dark wheel missions (again before my time), i am assuming (guessing) that those missions were removed as the player DW faction wasn't the real DW faction?
But then in the Elite world (putting aside real life) all factions are player factions? yes i confuse myself sometimes.
