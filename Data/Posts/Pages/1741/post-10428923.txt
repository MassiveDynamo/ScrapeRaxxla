The last paragraph in the Codex, The Dark Wheel raises doubt about the origins of The Dark Wheel in Shinrarta Dezhra.
As i mentioned in my above post ^ , i'm already well aware of that Codex entry. Probably read/listened to it around 500 times by now since my 5 months of joining EliteD.

The RAXXLA entry i've probably read/listened to around 1000 times. So yeah, congrats FDev you have certainly tricked---err i mean---hooked me in!

See the thread: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/turning-the-wheel.546088/
That thread is over 160 pages long and i'm sorry but i just can't read all of that right now.

Plus, tbqh , the more forum posts i read the more i'm starting to lose some hope & mystery within this glorious EliteD game.
( Not blaming you btw Marcos , i'm just saying in general it's a very delicate balance between coming to these forums for information & guidance , combined with possibility of ruining/tainting ingame immersion & motivation cuz of spoilers and/or speculations )

I just don't understand why FDev apparently previously allowed players to actually NAME their own personal faction 'The Dark Wheel' ....unless they indeed meant it to become some type of community driven entity.
