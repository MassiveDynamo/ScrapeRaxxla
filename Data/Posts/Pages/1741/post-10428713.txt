Thanks mate, ive just stumbled across your comment in the thread re Dark wheel missions (again before my time), i am assuming (guessing) that those missions were removed as the player DW faction wasn't the real DW faction?
But then in the Elite world (putting aside real life) all factions are player factions? yes i confuse myself sometimes.

No one knows for certain the real reason why the original missions were removed and not fixed, but it’s evident they were broken. And no they were not linked to any player faction.

On page one there is a detailed history concerning this.

Irrespective of what they involved, around the time this was all brought to the attention of FD; MB did respond on the forums, that those missions weren’t spawning where they were supposed to, namely close to SD, and FD alluded it was to be looked into.

Ergo, I can only speculate such context confirms they were likely broken from the start, or bugged due to some update but it was never confirmed officially.

Over time the codex was later introduced. Still no official confirmation.

The confirmation identified through this forum was only obtained from cross-examination of the support system, who could not answer complex questions and had to get the DEV team to get involved and provide answers.

Strange how the old support system no longer exists, and we can’t ask such open questions anymore .
