In the 'Quest for Raxxla' one of the thing I found really useful was to try to imagine what was in Brookes and Braben's head when they were discussing/implementing Raxxla before/during the creation of Elite Dangerous.
This is definitely the logic that has me looking around NGC 7822 right now with a bunch of unanswered questions:
- why is there a giant (if non-obvious) arrow pointing right at it?
- why does it need a giant arrow pointing right at it when it's NGC 7822 and the arrow is considerably less obvious than the object itself?
- how could anything be hidden here that wouldn't have been discovered accidentally by now anyway?
