Interesting point a non-ED-player made to me about the "8th moon" thing: the obvious ED assumption is that it refers to the moon which is 8th nearest to the body it orbits (i.e. designation 'h'). But in astronomical terms, it could equally (possibly even more likely) refer to the 8th biggest by either mass or radius - and of course there are plenty of other orderable properties in-game as well.

(So if you find an interesting candidate, it's probably worth checking all the moons)
