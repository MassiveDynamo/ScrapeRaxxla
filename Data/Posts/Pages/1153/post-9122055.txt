Hello, cmdr's, someone's know about type9 (they have cargo thargoid sensors) convoy to witch's reach and etc. Who they are faction?

if you seen them in game and target them faction name should be in bottom left info box. Or do you mean something else you found somewhere? If so can you provide a link? Or a screenshot? Im not sure what you mean but someone else might.
