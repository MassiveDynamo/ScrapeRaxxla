So I ran across another possibility for princess astrophel. - Not quite as good as Parijat in my mind.. But this one is related to our good friend the Evening Star "Luceafărul" is a Romanian Poem about a princess who falls in love with the Evening star... I didnt notice any cunningly concealed facts though...
This is an interesting discovery, yes, and the Romanian angle is something for thought too.

Link analysis.

Luciana Nedelea - is from Romania and the artist who penned the image for Michael Brookes back tattoo (cue references to Adamastor?) but also the cover art for his ‘unpublished’ book (potential narrative for Raxxla?) of the same story, also a cover of his favourite book ‘Paradise Lost’ and Brookes used to promote her work through his Older Ones productions, and seems (from open source analysis) still in contact (social media) identifying a long established alignment.

Within MB blog post on Paradise Lost he admits he’s “no scholar”, and in fact preferred an ‘accessible’ format of one of his favourite works - Paradise Lost, the ‘Parallel Prose Edition’.

Edit: Although the book cover art looks very similar in style to that of the artist, it is in fact by another by the name of Kirsten Behee.

If applicable then there could be an artistic influence pertaining to Romania within the narrative construction of Raxxla (in the past did make public enquiry into her understanding of the back tattoo context - but that logically drew a blank, it being a private commission), it’s obviously an unknown and highly likely observational bias, much like the link analysis around Brookes and ‘Oak Island’. But none the less something to consider.
