So I ran across another possibility for princess astrophel. - Not quite as good as Parijat in my mind.. But this one is related to our good friend the Evening Star "LuceafÄƒrul" is a Romanian Poem about a princess who falls in love with the Evening star... I didnt notice any cunningly concealed facts though...
