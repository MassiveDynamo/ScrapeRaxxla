sorry for my english
Dont be sorry for that, I guarantee you whatever language is your native one I cant speak it better than you can speak / write in English.

If youre French I can ask for 1/2 lb of cheese.
If youre German I can ask you where the Town Hall is
If youre Welsh I can insult you pretty well but nothing else

Anything else I cant even begin to talk

in 2015 devs were implementation patch 1.2, where ingame we got convoy to systems witch's reach, lft 509, isinor

Do you mean the Military Convoys that were spotted talking in chat and then had UAs onboard maybe? They were precursors / signs of Thargoids and finding UAs and took a while for a Cmdr to finally hatchbreak them? if so there may be a thread somewhere but before my time so hazy on details. Dunno if thats the right time though or where they were headed and not sure what faction they were unless they were the Isinor ones that @simulacrae mentioned.
