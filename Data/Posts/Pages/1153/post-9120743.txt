Host Mentioned 'Survivorman' and apparently a load of other crash sites we haven't found yet but no idea what he was on about? Anybody know that story?

Refers to the thargoid varient over Palins base that was seen as a human type being Jameson being really alive as a space "survivorman" after the final mission of First encounters as when he saved the Thargoids from Mycoid they had given him a human flyable Thargoid ship
John Jameson with the Cobra at the Thargoid site is the father Jameson in FE2. The Commander in FFE is unknown.

The first Thargoid war that 'ended' with Jameson's Mycoid attack, happened approximately in the 3150s.
The events in FFE happened in the 3250s. All the stuff with Agrent, Turner and the goids in the Pleiades have been confirmed in ED. What happened after 'the player' got involved with the story is completely unknown, for now.
