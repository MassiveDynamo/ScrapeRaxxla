You can never tell with a ninja penguin, he might never have actually left! Ninjas are masters of obfuscation, deception and concealment. Perhaps we should ask him where Raxxla and TDW are?
He posted yesterday (https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/stations-labelled-with-fsp.140306/post-9117228) on the “Stations labelled with FSP#” thread.

The idea was that if Fed spaceports are consecutively numbered, then a database of all 10,500 currently reported by EDDB would reveal any missing stations and hence might lead to TDW’s stealthed station (since it is likely to be a disused fed station).
However it has been pointed out that:
the FSP# uses only 4 decimal digits, therefore there would be repeated numbers
moreover they are not consecutively numbered but the FSP is generated by a procedural algorithm that depends on station name and the star system (presumably name, though might be galactic coordinates).
The Federation has lost systems, and therefore station FSP likely have been lost.
Hence unlikely that this would be a useful line of enquiry.
