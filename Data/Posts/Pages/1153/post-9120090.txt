Quite good, starts around 8m in. Host does talk over him a LOT though and cuts him off a LOT but we still get some really good info.

Debunked once again 'A commander honked and jumped' through Raxxla system when asked directly if any truth in that story at all.

Speculation - Guardians not a dead race. We would have got more info but host insisted on talking over him.

Host Mentioned 'Survivorman' and apparently a load of other crash sites we haven't found yet but no idea what he was on about? Anybody know that story?

'All names chosen for a reason but players not necessarily on the right track' or words to that effect about Hesperus & Adamastor names.

Overall -started really well after obvious 'where's Raxxla?' question and we got a lot of really good info about the current story, some past and some possible future. Later got talked over a lot and cut off a lot but deffo worth watching. Maybe @Jorki Rasalas one for your video thread?
