Yes we also have to acknowledge that the Codex didn’t exist at that time. Which specifically identifies that the DW is no longer in SD...

My hypothesis is that prior to this, the DW in SD was ‘then’ the real DW and issued the older DW missions that led to Raxxla or some other narrative. That was our ‘tiny bit obvious’, until FD binned it, either because (most likely) it was extremely bugged (eg missions spawning everywhere) or that it was too easy... either way I strongly suspect FD altered the narrative at this point and shelved the DW missions until the Codex, where they force implemented a new DW.

If true then using numbered stations to identify any missing stations wouldn’t find the DW because at that time I believe the DW was in SD...

It was however a grand idea, but FD basically said when questioned around Braben’s “numbered stations” fluff, that all this around Fed stations was auto generated, if it were linked to Raxxla, they had a great concept on their hands, a missed opportunity. But as you pointed out very likely random or just made up.
