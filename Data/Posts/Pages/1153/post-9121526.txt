Could be a simple reference to ‘giants and trees’?

Adamastor is a giant
Hesperus could be the daughters of Hesperus / The Garden of the Hesperides.

Lot of giants hanging about trees in Philip Sidneys work... also Hesperides holds a lot of correlation to the tree of life / golden apples / pole star / Draco...
