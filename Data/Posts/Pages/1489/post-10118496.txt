Random thought - what if the title: Astrophel and Spiralling Stars, is not actually important? What if the reference to a ‘children’s story’ is?

Any star systems linked to children’s stories in game?

There is one very brief mention of a childrens story in Elite:Legacy:

"It seemed natural to me that a girl didn't go to school. Or have toys to play with. I didn't know that it wasn't normal for an entire family to live in a tiny cell. I was too young to work, so while my mother and father slaved in the mines, I remained locked in the cell alone. I had no form of entertainment except for a book, a single book about a young man's quest to save a princess from an alien dragon. My father must have bought it on the black market. He couldn't have got it from anywhere else.

"I still have that book."
