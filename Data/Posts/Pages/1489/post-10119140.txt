Random thought - what if the title: Astrophel and Spiralling Stars, is not actually important? What if the reference to a ‘children’s story’ is?

Any star systems linked to children’s stories in game?

princess astrophel and the spiralling stars...

Astrophel being star lover...Princess Andromeda?

And the spiralling stars....Cassiopeia is close to the North Star, and never sinks below the horizon as it rotates in plain sight around the North Star?

Just a thought
