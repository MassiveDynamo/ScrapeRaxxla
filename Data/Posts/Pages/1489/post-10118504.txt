There is one very brief mention of a childrens story in Elite:Legacy:

"It seemed natural to me that a girl didn't go to school. Or have toys to play with. I didn't know that it wasn't normal for an entire family to live in a tiny cell. I was too young to work, so while my mother and father slaved in the mines, I remained locked in the cell alone. I had no form of entertainment except for a book, a single book about a young man's quest to save a princess from an alien dragon. My father must have bought it on the black market. He couldn't have got it from anywhere else.

"I still have that book."
This looks promising. I would possibly look for context for a location. "Slaved in the mines" sounds distinctly Imperial - especially Zemina Torval. This is from her Powers profile:

“Those who treat their slaves badly should receive the same. After all, how can they work properly if they are not cared for correctly?” -

Senator Zemina Torval

Her HQ is Synteini.
