Well, Legacy was touted originally as a follow on to the original DW novella. But the actual story doesn't come across like that at all, being about the struggles of a small mining community and its independent faction.

But under the surface there may be some interesting aspects.

In AHTW, the CIEP (who are a splinter of TDW) hold a council meeting, and among the members of the inner circle is Hamer the Fisherman. In Legacy, there is Hammer who's anaconda is made to look like a weak trader vessel but is a trap for pirates. So surely, he is Hammer the Fisherman (complete with mis-spellings, but the editing of both books is pretty weak). So there may be at least one DW member in the story. Ofc he gets killed, so there's no ongoing thread there..
