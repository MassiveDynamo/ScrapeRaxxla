Gunn's CIEP station has a fairly detailed description of its environs, but alas all system descriptions in the novels are unreliable as things changed after their final edit. The GG in the book, called there 'Middleton', does not exist anywhere under that name, again due likely to the botched implementation of the authors requests for systems in game. The cockups here are legion - some systems have swapped assets due to human error. All of this makes finding the CIEP assets extremely difficult.
Freeholm in Artemis is the only asteroid base in an Imperial system. If you also factor in Independent systems, there are a total of 48 but most are not near Imperial territory. Start at Freeholm.
