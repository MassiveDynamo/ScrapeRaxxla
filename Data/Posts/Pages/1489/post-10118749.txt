There's a possibility that hasn't been investigated with the "telescopes".
It could be a clue contained in the star logo, as an esoteric sign for those who know. It's common practice for secretive groups, it signals the presence of the group in a hidden yet in plain sight way.
The star arrangement may be a schematic similar to a particular set of stars in the sky.
Or maybe it is a map of the system we are looking for. A quadruple star (the 4 "6-branches" are certainly stars, the rest could be other bodies, planets and gas giants)
The different shapes on the logo could also be different spectral types.
A telescope is a tool of astrophilia, and the logo used has "spiralling-like" stars on it.
I find it difficult to think this hasn't been thought in a world like Elite.

Edit : added logo for reference
