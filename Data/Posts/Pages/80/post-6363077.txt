Could well be but every single NPC I've followed does exactly the same. I shall continue until next weekend trying to follow ships then return to the bubble. I will update this thread with what (If anything) I find.

I've found about 10-20% manage to charge their FSD and jump out rather than flying up to 100km. They've taken me to nearby systems where they then drop out at seemingly-random bodies. Sometimes they'll then fly around in circles apparently forever (I watched one do it for an hour). Other times they'll instead try to pirate me and then fly on to another system.
