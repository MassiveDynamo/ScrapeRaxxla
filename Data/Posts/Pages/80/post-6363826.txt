I've found about 10-20% manage to charge their FSD and jump out rather than flying up to 100km. They've taken me to nearby systems where they then drop out at seemingly-random bodies. Sometimes they'll then fly around in circles apparently forever (I watched one do it for an hour). Other times they'll instead try to pirate me and then fly on to another system.

I will keep at it for a week or so just in case. Then I will have to start tin-foiling
