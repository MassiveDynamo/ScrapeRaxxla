Major Tin Foil ahead.

"... on Raxxla there's an alien construct that's a gateway to other Universes, and all that's in those Universes in the way of bounty, and treasures, and aliens, and life . . ."

"there are people on Raxxla already. This is only a guess, mind you, but from what happened to Jason I'd say it was close to being right. We've long suspected that a corps of Ã©lites lives there, and are exploiting the gateway. They're powerful, twisted men." - Rafe Zetter.

The only thing special about Raxxla itself is the Gateway. All the really good stuff is on the other side of Raxxla, beyond door so to speak.

Raxxla itself is already occupied. By powerful and twisted men. Elites who are exploiting the Gateway.

Let's listen to Rafe one more time:

Remember the Antares? Vice President Nigel Smeaton? Assassinated when he got to close to the truth behind the Antares. It looked for a time that Core Dynamics might have been behind things. Over a year ago (on the Rift Thread) I shared my suspicions that Core Dynamics is nothing but a front for Sirius Corporation.

Sirius Corp, whose tech sometimes seems to leapfrog the rest of the industry is a pretty good match for Rafe's description of the people occupying and exploiting the Raxxla gateway.

There's the obvious too - The proto-sirius corporation sent a colony mission to a star with no known habitable planets in the earliest days of space colonisation, for no apparent reason. That was insane. Then there's this line about them setting up vast industrial and manufacturing facilities using the abundant energy of the star, etc.

What if it goes something more like - an early scouting mission/probe to Sirius detected alien junk, and a corporation took a gamble on making it big by secretly exploiting alien technology. The colonists arrived and found the Raxxla gateway and used that to gain "vast riches".
