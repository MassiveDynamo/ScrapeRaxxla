Hmmmm...Thanks, CMDR! I think I just found my first exploration plan to do a shake down of my DBX I'll hopefully have by the weekend. Finally getting involved! Any tips for a newb?

Get yourself a tin-foil hat. Seriously, get it: now that you are involved you'll go mad anyways, but with the tin-foil hat as proof you can at least pretend having tried to prevent it ... [wacky]

Good luck and fly safe!
