I went back to EAFOTS RA-G B11-0 3 to follow the strange Elite ships with a wake scanner to see if they would lead me to Raxxla. And this is where things got really strange, all the ships would climb to approx 150km, do a 180 degree turn and stop pointing directly back to the Gamma site. . Then start emitting a strange sound. I tried analysing it with audacity but could not get anywhere.

If anyone knows how to upload video / .mp3 to this forum or a site I can easily link them from I will do so.

Well, are you able to use YouTube? That would serve just fine.
