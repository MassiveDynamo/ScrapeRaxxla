I have to say Jorki, the first time you added Wanderers in, it made me think of football teams, which then made me think of Unseen Academicals.

I do wonder if Raxxla will be octarine...

I also like Unseen Academicals as a squadron name
Any tribute to the late great Terry is fine by me!

but I also like Jorki’s Terriers; for cat lovers, or anyone south of Derby, a Yorkshire Terrier is a small dog breed with a Bold, Tenacious, Independent, Intelligent, Confident & Courageous temperament.

Though after more than six weeks of exploring my current hypothesis my Tenacious level is down around D D), but not quite ready to share fully...:x

And sorry everyone, I’ve been grumpy this week because seven days ago I had a trapped nerve in my neck (sorted by osteopath) which prevented me sleeping plus shoulder muscle damage, which is ongoing; I’m blaming my enthusiastic labrador who goes nuts when he sees another dog.

not octarine I think, but I hypothesise the basic game start menu screen shows us it is octahedral - Raxxla Gateway orbiting an alien planet (Guardian Ark ship perhaps? given the close orbit its likely to be relatively light but otherwise indistinguishable from a normal planet). This is the only clue we have, it’s been in-game since the beta, & it is “just a little bit obvious”! so I’m thinking it’s Raxxla. It will be stealthed so not easily detectable - like the Dark Wheel station apparently mentioned in the codex (be glad when beta is over & I can get my hands on it!) which I suspect is the one shown in the Horizons start menu screen (neither screen has sufficient skybox detail to allow location by pattern matching).....discuss!
