I think with the amount of interest that’s been shown in this topic then “Apathetic Wanderers” is more appropriate; though I do like Dark Matters Squad & on the strength of it would buy you a lavian brandy in the squadron bar, though looks like we’ll never get one. Mainly because I loved Dark Matter the tv series, & am still furious it was cancelled!

Or miss that first letter. Pathetic Wanderers sounds good too
