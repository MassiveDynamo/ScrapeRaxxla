Regarding the squad name, what about simply calling it Formidine Squadron?

The FR is where the main focus of the efforts have been over the years, so naming the squad after the region which pulled everyone together could be a nice nod to that. It doesn't mean the squad will only focus on Raxxla searching, and it doesn't even mean the Formidine region will be the only place the members fly in, but the name would at least have some history behind how the squadron came to be together.

Just a thought.
