I thought that the planet you see on the main menu screen was just Ariel (moon of Uranus, has steep ridges in-game) and that the station (Coriolis in standard, Orbis in Horizons) was just a generic station. It's an inventive idea to think there might be something hidden right under our noses but I'm sceptical that there is any meaning in this particular case.
