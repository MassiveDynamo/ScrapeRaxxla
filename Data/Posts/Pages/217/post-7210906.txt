OK, so you may have chosen your name by now...

What about Dark Matters Squadron? Get it? Dark matter? OK, I'll grab my flight suit...

Unlurking, really enjoying the continual thoughts and philosophical ideas that are coming out of this thread. Most of all looking forward to Beta making it into the main game. I am hoping we all start making some progress!

I think with the amount of interest that’s been shown in this topic then “Apathetic Wanderers” is more appropriate; though I do like Dark Matters Squad & on the strength of it would buy you a lavian brandy in the squadron bar, though looks like we’ll never get one. Mainly because I loved Dark Matter the tv series, & am still furious it was cancelled!
