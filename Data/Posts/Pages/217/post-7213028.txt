Complete tinfoil moment - hungover whilst at Bernards - hic- Barnards Loop, the station orbiting the planet on the main menu screen (especially the older Orbis one) - can anyone see a station name on it (4k longshot) - or has anyone thought to try and triangulate those locations?
I looked but couldn’t see anything. They’re videos rather than the game engine so I don’t know whether the High Res screenshot option would work.
