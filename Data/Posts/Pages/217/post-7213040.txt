I thought that the planet you see on the main menu screen was just Ariel (moon of Uranus, has steep ridges in-game) and that the station (Coriolis in standard, Orbis in Horizons) was just a generic station. It's an inventive idea to think there might be something hidden right under our noses but I'm sceptical that there is any meaning in this particular case.
Yeah, I was dubious about whether they related to anything, but the TDW stuff in the Codex talks about a dark orbis. And I can’t see any real signs of lights on the orbis from the Horizons screen. That could always just be down to contrast due to the lighting, but it’s still a possibility that it’s actually lightless.
