Danube, a major European river
Also bare in mind that the Danube was the centre of our creation story (for us Druids) as told in 'The Ever Living Ones', this is where our great tree was formed.
All of life spread out from there.
Rivers have a huge place in our hearts as they are the gateweay to the afterlife (or true realm depending on your view), so water is both the beginning and the passage to new realms.
I still believe all pagan gods are the same (im of Irish pagan belief) just with different names.
