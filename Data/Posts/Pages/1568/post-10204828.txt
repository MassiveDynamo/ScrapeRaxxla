Okay, I don't have one. What's the maximum range of Jumpaconda? Drew's video cited 655 LY via "wormholes". Even propaganda is right occasionally to be believable. Nothing meant against him, he had no idea of the deeper narrative that was being crafted. Antares and Starship One used Hydrogen, we had Hydrogen pre-GalCop (see Reorte and Sirius), and fuel scooping at least as far back as invasion of Achenar. I am just trying to figure out how to close the gap between reported maximum of a Jumpaconda vs this rumored 655 LY figure.
