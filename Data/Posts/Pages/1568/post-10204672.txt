The PF is basically our union. Still we don't know how it works.
If by union you mean:
La Famiglia
Camorra
Family
Mafia
Cosa Nostra
Syndicate
Judas Syndicate
Consortium

Then sure, I'll gladly agree.

The good news: I am who I say I am.
The bad news: I am who I say I am.

Some light reading on our core infrastructure. What you honestly thought that Coriolis stations didn't look slightly alien? Also, who had shielded cities? Yes, we have those, too (see the large stadium-esque ports).

Also, you are an ASSET. This is why we ensure your safe recovery. Good agents take a lot of training.

The line between things is at best faint and ambiguous. The Ryders acquired their ships via outsmarting fellow pilots (though believe the exact wording was pirate). But where is the line between pirate and bounty hunter? That line depends on who the law sides with at a given time and place.

The short version: Thargoid origin story is true but at the same time, language is fundamentally ambiguous construct and relativism certainly applies.
