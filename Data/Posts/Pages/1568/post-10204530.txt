I am thinking Eridanus is again important. It leads directly to Orion.



Also, Orion is attacking Taurus which has Pleiades at its heart. There have been too much that ended and started at the Pleiades and the general region of Barnard's Loop (INRA, INRA defeated by Argent, Janus Incorporated, the revived Alliance effort to make contact at Cooper Research Centre/Hyford saga, Merope Expeditionary Fleet, etc).


Pleiades is literally the heart of Taurus.
