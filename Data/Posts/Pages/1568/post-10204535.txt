Since Achenar is at the foot of Eridanus then the Lost Realms region is below that end but perhaps travelling through key systems in Eridanus is required? Are Artemis, Hecate, Demeter or other Paradise Lost/mythological systems in the constellation? (There are dozens of stars in the HIP catalogue in the constellation but many stars are renamed - yet they should still respond to their catalogue names).
(I think you have to be in or very close to Sol to see the constellations on the Galaxy Map as they soon get distorted).
