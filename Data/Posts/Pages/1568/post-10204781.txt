Better view to add to @Darrack posting. This appears to somewhere above Milky Way off of Saramond's Rift. Given Landscape Signal was just confirmed as intended behavior per a recent ticket, perhaps there is something harnessing Sagr A* (the Milky Way's central blackhole). I very much get the feeling though we have to first understand the parts closer to the Bubble, first. Though, 14 (Station) very much looks like a globular cluster or satellite galaxy to the Milky Way. The galaxy at bottom left just appears to be Milky Way angled with more detail. The Devil's Shroud (river looking area in upper middle) might be Orion Molecular Cloud Complex/Barnard's Loop as it obscures a significant stretch of sky.

Note: Earlier I had pointed out Eridanus goes directly towards Orion which has quite a number of blackholes (15) in the region.
