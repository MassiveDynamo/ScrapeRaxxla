Just found our missing river to this Yggradasil business..

The river is the constellation Eridanus that ends at Achenar.

Eridanus (constellation) - Wikipedia

Achenar's other designation: Alpha Eridanus
Eradinus has been part of a couple of ED's mystery events. It has been used as a hint in the Salome / Zurara event and in at least one Millionaire treasure hunt.
