I think you can get 85/86 LY from an Annie so thats 172LY on premium, my Annie does 83.36 but im not dropping below a 5A PP, its paper thin as it is and i only use it as a carrier based explorer for high up.

O7
Neutron boosting (300% increase over normal)...
~255 LY

Premium Fuel Injection (100%) + Neutron boost (300%)= (hypothetical - suspected not possible)
~340 LY

Possible ways to close the gap:

"You called an Engineer?" (performance vs mass - the "I don't need no engineers" strategy) (potentially significant)*
Deep Charge for FSD grade 4 or lower (negligible)
Mass Manager for FSD grade 5 or higher (negligible)
Engineered module mass reductions + engineered boost (possibly significant)
Guardian FSD booster (medium impact)
Suspect you would need to combine strategies. Still, I have to believe this must be possible. It would be huge as a ship could out jump a carrier.

Which means either there is something more exotic than neutron stars with a bigger boost (~600%) or there is an as-yet uncovered jump mechanic. I get the feeling Drew Wagar was given that figure by either Michael Brookes or David Braben himself.

*-Think bare minimums to get the job done with maximal increase in ship stats with factory parts.
