I am still mapping Holdstocks book, picking it apart analytically, this is a little time consuming seeing as I’m in the middle of a house re-build / side note the upside is I’m aiming to convert my basement into a modern games room! (Potentially might get myself a new PC, and finally upgrade my backers LTP to Odyssey). Any way-rivers are important!

Apart from the obvious historical associations; in Holdstock’s Lost Realms rivers are identified as pathways to these realms or ‘other worlds’.

In game as I’ve mentioned, many of these realms are duplicated in game, but the author (Brookes and/or Stroud?) have injected additional alternatives, adding to the cacophony of realms, and some of these are referencing sunken lands (eg Atlantis or Ys). So yes water or rivers do flow through these realms.

Interesting enough these realms (so far) are abutting against the lowest part of Yggdrasil, they don’t ‘merge’. This I find interesting because one of these Norse mythological systems Jotunheim is itself described as an ‘other-land’ on the edge of the world.

This ties in with Holdstock’s imaginations and further (I feel) establishes the area between them as being of some import. I hope to find more time to complete these maps as there is a significant gap and it will, I am certain, further establish this hypothesis and potentially help identify further information.
Looking back at the books map


The connection of the systems to the black holes is very much a river from the Devils shroud to Urgenirk Darks.
Just noticed point 14 listed as 'Station'? need to re read the book.
