I think you can get 85/86 LY from an Annie so thats 172LY on premium, my Annie does 83.36 but im not dropping below a 5A PP, its paper thin as it is and i only use it as a carrier based explorer for high up.

Correct that you can get just over 88LY if you drop the fuel tank down to 3C but that gives you one jump
