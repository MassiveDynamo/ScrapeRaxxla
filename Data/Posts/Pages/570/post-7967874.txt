So what does that mean for the Alliance Festival of Culture, is that real or is it the last story just running to the end? Nothing going on in any of the Festival systems Ive been to. Only mentioning as this week it announces next weeks event which it hasnt before and made me wonder if something is going to happen at the presentation ceremony. If just last story finishing Im cool with that, I enjoyed this one and I can delete all the strangely named people, works and paintings etc mentioned. (You can't put anything in this game without somebody making something of it, must be a minefield for fdev)

Last Tuesday I first mapped most of a system, 183 LY from Sol I think it was, with an un-mapped GG and 8 moons. An 8 moon system <200LY from Sol, un-mappped until last Tuesday, just saying they are out there. It was in Col 285. Suspiciously no blue surface signals that I found....must be evidence of a cloaking system, no? No, but its fun to say that if someones watching you play. .

Also I have now first mapped 1 Aisling Duval system and 1 Mahon system as well. Both in the bubble, but neither with an un-mapped 8th moon. I started playing 5 months ago I think. So it could be closer than you think.
