Depends what the DLC includes and if feet in ships and stations is base game.

The DLC could be sold as Horizons Gas Giants, with feet bundled in for free.

Iâ€™d rather have a pair of red/green old style 3D specs so I can decode the trailer movie, which is clearly superimposed zooms of two different views of the universe (LMC on the left, Barnards Loop/Witchhead etc on the right but obscured by dust), almost as though its a plan and side view of a specific region of interest.....
