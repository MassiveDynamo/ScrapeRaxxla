It's a pity that FD are planning to stop these stories, with no in-game element. If nothing else, Gan's story was a reminder of Halsey's visions. New player may not be aware of this. If a few new players learn something from a story like this, it was worth writing.
Not allowing in-game lore with out in-game content, is just an excuse to reduce writing hours.
The off-camera stories were always better, as they weren't limited by the game's relatively simple mechanics.
The book was better
