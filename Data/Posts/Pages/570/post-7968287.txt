We may not get access to the TDW station until we can use our Elite feet to explore it...

Doesn’t really make sense for FD to implement now a station that could only be accessed by a completely new (& as yet only rumoured) mechanism. I think it’s in-game now, I think the codex implies that, and I think the Horizon start screen hints at it (that’s not a current design of wheeled station). when we find TDW station it will either be locked (i.e. doors closed) or refuse access until we have a permit/passed a skill test/allied with SD TDW/ etc, or it will be accessible (I search with some exploration data to sell, just in case).
