What happened when the Zurara was found? Mostly nothing.
I don't think finding TDW or Raxxla is going to change anything significant - just someone will have the kudos of finding them.
The Zurara was already dead. Nothing to do (would have been too cool !), end of the story.
The legendary TDW secret home base is supposed alive, with traffic, operations running, etc.. I can't believe "mostly nothing" would happen. Come on.
But I do believe nobody has the slightest idea of how that could be managed in terms of gameplay and storyline. Not even FD. (Besides, the mandatory tourist beacon, of course)
EDIT: oh sorry ! I have an idea. You find the station, it vaporizes you instantaneously and then jumps to another system, the Codex is actualized and people can start the quest again. A tourist beacon Soontill-like pays tribute to the unlucky Cmdr and tells "Here was found the lengendary TDW station by Cmdr X, R.I.P " And you respawn with a gifted Anaconda . Anything else ?

So basically saying, game content is dull. It seems like they notice us paying attention to something in game that motivated people to play. and instead of building on this and making it in game element, they say they are going to stop. Where was the actual logic to this? It's like they want us bored
It's a sandbox.
