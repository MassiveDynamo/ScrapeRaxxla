The book is always better.

Elite books would have been pretty dull if they had to stick to in-game observable content.
So basically saying, game content is dull. It seems like they notice us paying attention to something in game that motivated people to play. and instead of building on this and making it in game element, they say they are going to stop. Where was the actual logic to this? It's like they want us bored
