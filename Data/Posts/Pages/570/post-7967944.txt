Jorki Rasalas said:
I’m thinking that Raxxla started off as pure myth, something like “the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow” (apologies if any reader actually believes in leprechauns, I have no desire to belittle anybody’s personal belief system!). Since we were told by FD “it exists” and “it’s in the Milky Way” then the Raxxla we are looking for is something substantial (i.e. not a state of cosmic enlightenment), so the original myth must have been applied to name whatever “it” is by whoever/whatever found “it”.

And back in the original game (~3190), around the time of that naming, jump range was only 7ly.

Edit: just wondering if that “cosmetic enlightenment” in the Codex is not a typing slip but actually intended as a clue...
I’m thinking ‘cosmic enlightenment’ is like the Gan clue ‘space, not black but radiant like heaven’
Space - radiant
Cosmic - enlighten
It’s in a nebula or galactic core (system with no bodies?)

I think we have all got the wrong end of the stick with the Gan story, it was the fact that he was able to steal a ship. Now we will have fleet carriers, somewhere safe to store our ships, maybe stations are no longer a safe place to store your ships.
Why grind to build a conda when you can just steal one

I will follow this lead when I get back to the bubble, unlock Vega, visit Fort Dixon, get friendly with the chief investigator.
