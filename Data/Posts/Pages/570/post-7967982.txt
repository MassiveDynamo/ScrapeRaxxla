If its a map, does Jameson's last messages fit into Parents Grief? Is the fact that its there more than a homage or a finish to the old lore? Is it a direction pointer? Just looking for 'tiny bit obvious'. Doesn't always have to be ancient Greek me thinks.

Am I right that Jameson and Ryder existed at the same time or are they supposed to be different periods in time? If same then its a direct link to that time period and may mean more. Assuming he was on a 'direction' straight back from the homeworld to Lave/Sol? I'm still not clear how he got there or got back in current lore with current technology that we have access to, or don't we? If he mis-jumped sideways or all over then at least it kills that theory. Did he jump into and back from 'witch-space' is what I mean?

Just thought, 'No Brakes' could be Lover's Woe...(in a very loose way and probably isn't but it could be this sort of thing, hidden in plain sight but readable for 'those with eyes to see', dunno why Dan Brown comes to mind with his chase across Rome's landmarks leading to the Illuminati)

We don't know when the toast was developed, while they knew where Raxxla was or long after they 'lost' it? Which is helpful I know.

Quite pleased I managed to get Illuminati into a conspiracy discussion without it being the conspiracy itself, thats a feat of 'skill' me thinks, now for the courage...wheres DB so I can tell him I don't like the colour of his car?
