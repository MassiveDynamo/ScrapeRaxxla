Another thing I had wondered and never really figured out. When in the galmap, if you have constellations on you can only see them when centered on sol and fairly closely zoomed in.
If it’s a travel tool so you can visit the stars of the constellations, why make it so you can’t actually see the stars of the constellations marked as such once you move off of sol to select one?
Why does it seem, at least to me, that so many of the 88 Classic constellations are missing? The stars are there but they’re not displayed as constellations when you have the constellation map on. Some even seem incomplete.
If that’s the case, what constellations are shown and do the selected ones tell some kind of story?
seems fairly useless as a travel tool, and it’s not even good as a constellation map. So what purpose does it actually serve?
