there are many ways of traversing hyperspace in elite universe. jump drives are just the current mass market form. They produce a wake cloud that dissipates fairly fast but not fast enough to be un-traceable. Older forms of the tech had these types of residue clouds last longer or not at all. It's a product of the drive tech, not hyperspace itself.
