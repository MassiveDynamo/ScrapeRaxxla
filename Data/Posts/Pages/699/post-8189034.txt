Gonna hit up the CG later with my T9 just to get my name on it and get the cobra paint.
Then I think I’ll try a bit of bruit force searching if the area around and between Virgo and Coma Berenices constellations. Feel it’s intriguing enough given the toast and haven’t really given much time to searching it other than a small area directly between where the two constellations are closest to each other.
