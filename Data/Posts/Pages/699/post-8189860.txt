Thanks for the replies on Witchspace all.

What I was wondering is if the Thargoids are travelling in Dark Matter/Energy, hence why we can’t chase them. Will we one day get the same kind of engine tech reverse engineered so we can travel by Dark Matter/Energy?!

Could Raxxla be a portal to allow us to travel via Dark Matter/Energy....

I find myself pondering all sorts of ideas on Raxxla, I’m somewhat of a lurker to this thread. But I just started thinking about Dark Matter/Energy as a possibility.....

Dark matter could be something to do with it.
Dark Matter and Dark Energy are the placeholder names given to substances or forces present in our universe which we believe to be responsible for its accelerating expansion, even though - according to the laws of physics - its expansion should be slowing down.
Raxxla could be the key to understanding Dark Matter and using it, leading to incredible technological advancements on the scale of the Guardians or even the Thargoids.
Just a bit of tinfoil-hattery, but you know me
