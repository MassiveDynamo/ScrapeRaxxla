Getting a bit wordy here I guess but bored at work anywho, going back to the idea that Raxxla is possibly its own system, a rogue planet, just last year PC gamer interviewed one of the Devs that made the stellar forge and they said that when a system is generated, beyond all the internal math that goes on, other factors like rogue planets and passing comets are also thrown into the mix. This can create fledgling moons (I assume as captured comets) and throw off orbits (in the case of gravitational influence of rogue planets).
