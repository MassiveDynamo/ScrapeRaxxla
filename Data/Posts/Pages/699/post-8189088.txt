One other place of interest for me currently, and will probably take a little time before I can get out there because of other places I also want to see, is Corona Borealis. The crown constellation, or i welsh mythology, the castle of the silver circle. It was also featured heavily in HP Livecrafts “Hypnos” where he and an imaginary friend travel through voids to open their eyes to mysteries until they come across one he cannot cross. His friend does, but won’t speak of it. Eventually he wakes and finds his friend wasn’t real but was a sculpture he had made and inscribed on it was simply “Hypnos” in Greek.
