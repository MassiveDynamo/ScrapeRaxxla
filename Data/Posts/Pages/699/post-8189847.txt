Alright about to get on in a few mins but thought this was interesting. MB started a website about the Tau Ceti mission back in 2015. The website is since closed but the way back machine has some of it saved. Anywho seems what it is is a chronicle of the Venti probe sent to tau Ceti in 2099 and what it discovered. After a 200 year trip it arrives there and discovers the cetians, and from there goes on another mission to Epsilon Indi. Once it completes its mission there, from what I can gather from the fragmented info, is that it was angled off towards the LMC and sent off. Idk if it’s supposed to be in game or not but an early probe containing information about our earliest contacts etc might prove of worth. Also, it apparently encountered “sun dragons”. They seem like alien forms but also objects from what I can gather. Not much info on that part of it from TWBM saves. But there’s mention of “the sun dragon objects”. Made me think of TDW symbol (which sure from what I know is fan made but who that fan is who knows. Might be MB for all we know) a dragon clutching stars/planets around the galaxy. Wonder if there is a connection or a more complete archive of what MB wrote on the matter.
