I'm wondering now about the criteria needed to find Raxxla. See if you agree with any of these.

1) Must be Elite, Triple Elite, or Elite in just Combat?
2) Must have a Founders Permit, or other systems permit?
3) Must play in Open?
4) Locked behind a permit we can't get? (not in the game yet)?
5) Must have an engineered Exploration or Surface scanner, to see the DW?

Just interested in anyone's opinion on the criteria needed?

1) No. Those would be Dark Wheel criteria. I'm guessing that just Elite will do for TDW. Possibly connected to to the Founders permit.
2) Not unless Raxxla is in that permit locked system.
3) Doubt it. Unless they have an actor on standby, to welcome you.
4) Possibly
5) No. Scanners want help you. Engineered or not. Only eyes will do.
