Iirc, there also was a log in Conflux or Hawking's about some crew going crazy after they passed near some weird planet (voices or siren songs ? Can't remember..)
Could have been a way for FD to link in some way the Rift mYsTeRy with Raxxla Quest...
That's the Tethis you're thinking of there. Not a Rift thing, but still brilliant nonetheless. If anyone wants to check it out LHS 2206 is the first place to go to.

Edit - though in the FR Alpha logs, someone says they heard voices in witchspace, there's a mention of siren song, and the crew (or at least one) go crazy and blow the canopy. But it's the Tethis with the signal from the planet, and what's heard in the signal.
