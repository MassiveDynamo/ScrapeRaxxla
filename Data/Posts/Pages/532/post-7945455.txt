Landmines! Lol. I think Ryder is too early on in the engineering. We know Bill Turner is linked to the club....
What I was really thinking was that maybe Grade 5 with EVERY engineer unlocks something?? Only a thought. I dont know how many people have grade 5 with every engineer? I suspect its significantly less than how many triple elites there are
I think you're severely underestimating the number of people who bring with them a preconception that the game only starts once you reach an endgame state, and focus on entirely on getting to what they think that state is.

Also, you might be underestimating just how crucial G5 engineering is seen as by those involved in top end PVP.

The introduction of the Colonia engineers (and now Palin's protege) throws a bit of a spanner into this whole idea though.
