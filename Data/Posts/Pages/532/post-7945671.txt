So....

Was thinking about it being a 'personal journey' and the various things that could mean. And it brought me back to the rogue planet idea again. If it is a rogue planet and it's location doesn't stay the same. That could work as it being a different journey for different people because it's not in the same place.

Maybe once found it's not easy to find again, other than a general idea of the vast area it was last time you saw it. This could also be how someone from the dark wheel may have once found it but they still don't know where it is.

I know it's kind of a reach but so is most of this until something is confirmed in some way. Which probably won't be
