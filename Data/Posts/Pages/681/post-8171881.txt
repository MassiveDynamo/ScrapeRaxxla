I'm assuming that the FD test for presence of Raxxla is to get within X ls or Km of it's distance from primary star within system before it appears as a USS.
Currently 1.04 ly from Sol towards Alpha Hydri, but if it's in the opposite/any other direction I would be severely cheesed off! That would make it just about impossible to find!

@BlueWolve: Do you have something like Stellarium? Just had a thought but it would be a good idea to check the alignments of the planets within Sol for your hypothesis & see if Sol/Earth-Venus-Pluto line up for around the date of the first reported rumour of Raxxla.. Orbital period of Pluto is 248 years. So the alignment might ccurrently be pointing away from Raxxla? Actuallu Earth & Venus periods are too short to really matter, so just the Sol-Pluto alignment.
I don’t have anything like Stellaruim, but I have a few things to note in regards to the question.

First thing we know is;

“The earliest documented reference to Raxxla dates to 2296 and originates from an entry in the personal journal of Art Tornqvist, a shipboard mechanic based out of Tau Ceti. The entry does not describe Raxxla or its possible whereabouts, but its existence is evidence that the Raxxla legend was already in the public consciousness by that time.”

Also;

“It is impossible for the planets to ever perfectly align (because of their different tilts). Although sometimes they will appear to be in the same rough area of sky. However, because this is nothing more than appearance dependent on perception, one has to be at a particular point for them to appear to align.”

I will try and do a bit more digging with the tools I have available to see if we can get those specific planets to align in a particular way.
