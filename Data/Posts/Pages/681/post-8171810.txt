I'm assuming that the FD test for presence of Raxxla is to get within X ls or Km of it's distance from primary star within system before it appears as a USS.
Currently 1.10 ly from Sol towards Alpha Hydri, but if it's in the opposite/any other direction I would be severely cheesed off! That would make it just about impossible to find!

@BlueWolve: Do you have something like Stellarium? Just had a thought but it would be a good idea to check the alignments of the planets within Sol for your hypothesis & see if Sol/Earth-Venus-Pluto line up for around the date of the first reported rumour of Raxxla.. Orbital period of Pluto is 248 years. So the alignment might ccurrently be pointing away from Raxxla? Actually Earth & Venus periods are too short to really matter, so just the Sol-Pluto alignment.
