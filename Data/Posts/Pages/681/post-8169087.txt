I did go a bit further. I over shot by 0.02ly, at first.

Now I think I have to jump or get stuck out here. I would feel mean if I called the Fuel Rats 3 ly from Alpha Centauri.

they might enjoy the challenge!
just got into ship for an hour, so still just 0.67ly rom Sol. In the start screen my paintwork seems to have had a good sandblasting.
But I am beginning to heartily dislike the USS detections that keep cropping up and are reported in the top right window. How can they be detected without an FSS honk? Of course they're all 0.67ly away! I only want things within a few ls of me to show unless I honk!!!!!
I guess this is a known bug?
Watched 2 hours of YT Mark Knopfler on tour in Barcelona so far. Now for another 2 hours tour in Lisboa!
(it's the same tour & playlist, but who cares!)
Wish I could play guitar (at all, never mind anywhere near his standard)!!
