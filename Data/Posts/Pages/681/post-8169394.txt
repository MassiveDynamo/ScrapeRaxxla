By 'play guitar' do you mean you wish you had money for nothing and your chicks for free? Or that you become rich and can go twisting by the pool? Would you abandon your brothers in arms here on this thread?

Money - yes, chicks - maybe? Twisting - not at my age! Abandon brothers in arms? Nope, but Iâ€™m changing ISP next week so may be incommunicado for a few days!
