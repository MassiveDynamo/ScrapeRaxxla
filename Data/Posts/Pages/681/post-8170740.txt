Did you try translating Eurybia into Sanskrit and looking up Rigveda?

There are two dogs watching the way to heaven, for souls pass the Celestial River, but you are going to need a celestial ship with a good rudder to ascend happiness. A dog shows the way.

Berrada: “I am sorry Mr Wick. I cannot tell you where to find the Elder. (pauses at John Wick’s expression) You fail to understand. The Elder is not a man you find. He can only choose to find you. You wish to speak with him? Go to the edge of the desert, look up. Canis Minor, the dog that follows Orion through the sky. You follow the brightest star. Walk until you are almost dead, then.. keep walking. When you are on your last breath, he will find you. Or he will not.”
