Have anyone looked into Eurybia?

Eurybia: In Greek mythology, Eurybia /jʊəˈrɪbiə/ (Ancient Greek: Εὐρυβία, Εὐρυβίη, meaning "wide-force"), described as "[having] a heart of flint within her",[1] was the daughter of Pontus and Gaia,[2] consort to the Titan Crius, and mother of Astraeus, Perses, and Pallas.[3] She was known as the goddess of mastery of the seas, or power over them—particularly external factors like the winds or rising of the constellations. An older, relatively minor deity, her role in most mythology is as the ancestor of other gods.

Did you try translating Eurybia into Sanskrit and looking up Rigveda?

There are two dogs watching the way to heaven, for souls pass the Celestial River, but you are going to need a celestial ship with a good rudder to ascend happiness. A dog shows the way.
