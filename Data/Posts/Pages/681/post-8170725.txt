PSO J318.5-22 real life confirmed Rogue Planet nr Beta Pictoris (8o lys from Earth). So if ye popped over to BP, and headed out, would you reach a point where the Scanner range is exceeded and you could honk ye honker again to see if anyhting turns up? Which direction would you head? Zeta Pictoris looks to be the next star inline, but that would be from Earth view (or head back toward Sol?). What if Raxxla is a rogue planet but is only at the extreme end of a solar system briefly, before disapearing again, until the next time it is in system? But that would meaan it would be noticable for a week until the next server update?
Anyone had a look for it yet?
