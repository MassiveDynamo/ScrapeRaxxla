Raxxla? You mean that tourist planet full of senior Federal citizens and pensioners? I believe they do weekly cruises from Sol. Binge drinking and gambling. Treasure Island theme. It's somewhere in between an eye, a water snake and a phoenix, a system called Achenar. I don't know why they insist on writing it like that. It's exactly what Marlin Duval tried to escape from.

Tourist planet? Full of rich seniors? Binge drinking? Sounds ok to me!
But I’ll leave out the gambling, pensions don’t go all that far...
Maybe I could find a rich widow...with shares in a lavian brandy distillery
