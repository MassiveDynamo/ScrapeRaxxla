Raxxla isn't a planet....Raxxla is a hidden station, which is why the logo looks like a station

I have postulated that possibility several times in this thread, "Raxxla" might even be the name of TDW's stealth station, which would explain why the DW toast is relevant. However as DB said during a livestream " You don't know what it is". Until we find it we explore all possibilities.
