Being in the game and being searchable doesn't mean it can be found.
And even if you find it, you might not realize it's there.
I think the point is, that there IS a way to find it. We need to satisfy whatever barriers they have put in place to avoid it being directly found, but that is something you can do. Which ultimately means it can be found.
