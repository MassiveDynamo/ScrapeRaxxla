We (or I) don't believe that the Lagrange points are in play so far. There are actually 3 of them on Jupiter's orbit, perfect for the symbol, but searches have come up fruitless so far.
Lagrange point mechanics are supported by the game. The planet Lagrange in Alpha Centuri is the only example I can think of, but it works.

Only L4 and L5 are on the orbit. The three other are on the line through the two bodies.
