Yes, been there. Actually done most Lagrange points in the solar system in-game. Never found anything, but that’s no guarantee something isn’t hidden thereabouts! But it is observing within the solar system and out into the depths of space, so it’s location is likely not relevant.

Gaia is at Sun-Earth L2 position, as is the James Webb Space Telescope. Dont know how they keep the two from colliding!

...as far as I remeber JW is orbiting around the L" Point, not parked at it......
