Be carefull though. Whatever they were hinting at with blue triangles may well not be Raxxla! More likely a step in the current Thargoid War storyline (the only thing that seems to interest FD) that has been missed. IMHO it’s a hint about the Guardian Relics and/or their Thargoidised version (Unclassified Relics? I want to find a Confidential or Secret or Top Secret Relic!)

But yes, it seems like a good idea to more thoroughly investigate USS in systems. I’m afraid I’ve got past the burnout point and am currently not playing ....but of course that extra effort will slow activities down even more...
Totally agree.

But it’s something within the dialogue which rings familiar. I suspect they are talking about two things separately; as in the triangles are about the narrative / Thargoids / Guardians, whilst their discussion about hidden storylines might be a nudge towards Raxxla.

Someone here once said, things might be right under our noses, and that it might be a little like meeting the man behind the curtain; it just rings true that the reason we haven’t found it is simply because it’s not what we are presuming it to be, and that finding it / or becoming enlightened towards it; might be via a storyline played out in the game…

Or maybe not.

But remember the text: Well, if you're looking for adventure, I have a pretty solid lead on the location of Raxxla… which was potentially attributed to passengers, maybe it wasn’t our passengers?
