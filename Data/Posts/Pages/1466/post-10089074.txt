Totally agree.

But it’s something within the dialogue which rings familiar. I suspect they are talking about two things separately; as in the triangles are about the narrative / Thargoids / Guardians, whilst their discussion about hidden storylines might be a nudge towards Raxxla.

Someone here once said, things might be right under our noses, and that it might be a little like meeting the man behind the curtain; it just rings true that the reason we haven’t found it is simply because it’s not what we are presuming it to be, and that finding it / or becoming enlightened towards it; might be via a storyline played out in the game…

Or maybe not.

I absolutely agree that the breadcrumbs will be something played out in-game, & probably right under our noses (hence DB’s chortling when he said we dont know what it is). But what?..and where?

But I get really angry when “clues” are given out via Twitter and livestreams. I dont tweet and I hate livestreams. In 2015/6 they were interesting, but they degenerated into watching time wasting & boring gameplay, which is when I stopped watching them. Clues should be in-game, or maybe in Galnet, but nowhere else.

Edit
And someone in the thread https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/curious-statement-on-the-frameshift-live-today.614594/
said Arthur says something like this on every stream.....
And he’s said he knows nothing about Raxxla, hence this must be a hint to the current storyline.
