Ah, I see. Missed that. So TDW not finding Raxxla was part of the FFE lore, and part of the book ATTW storyline, but isnâ€™t in the codex so may not apply to ED.
Not quite. Raxxla / TDW wasn't part of FFE lore, at all.
The Thargoid / Alliance stuff was one possible story arc, from FFE.

At the time of writing (the novel) both these independent pieces of information were true, as per information provided by FD.

Later the Thargoid / Alliance story arc was retconned. This does not change the information given about Raxxla / TDW.
