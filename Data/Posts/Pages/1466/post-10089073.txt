So I finally got around to reading Elite: Out of Darkness

Just some observations - In spoiler for those who havent read it yet

SPOILER: TIDBITS


















You’ve spotted some interesting points there compadre!
Moira as in Moiré?

So could there be some hints in the books that we are not aware of? Not to Raxxla of course, as the authors were banned from that storyline, though didnt Michael Brookes write one? My memory is failing....need more breakfast caffeine!

But I am disappointed. When I saw you’d read OOTD and a spoiler I thought you were going to give us your artistic impression of a Thargoid foot soldier...I saw the “leaked” model online a while ago and wasn't impressed, didn’t match up to the description in OOTD. But I suspect that’s what the recent post about the FD mother of NPC AI is working on (where did I see that post).
