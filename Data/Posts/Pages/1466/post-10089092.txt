I absolutely agree that the breadcrumbs will be something played out in-game, & probably right under our noses (hence DB’s chortling when he said we dont know what it is). But what?..and where?

But I get really angry when “clues” are given out via Twitter and livestreams. I dont tweet and I hate livestreams. In 2015/6 they were interesting, but they degenerated into watching time wasting & boring gameplay, which is when I stopped watching them. Clues should be in-game, or maybe in Galnet, but nowhere else.

Edit
And someone in the thread https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/curious-statement-on-the-frameshift-live-today.614594/
said Arthur says something like this on every stream.....
And he’s said he knows nothing about Raxxla, hence this must be a hint to the current storyline.

Well he did comment about Raxxla on a previous interview, which would introduce the assumption he does know something.

If he has said he knows nothing, then either that denotes duplicity or that statement was only true at that particular time?

AT also mentions Raxxla in his Chan 4 skit… I’m doubtful he’s 100% ignorant.

AT “It’s there. Clearly it’s there. I’ve said this in another stream, I’ll say it today, it’s been going a longtime. The payoff would have to be great, and that’s all I will say on it”.
