Obviously, you need to build a Cobra MK III with exactly 7.0(00) Ly of jump range. Discard all these modern inventions, return to the origin and come back to the truth. Only then will you see the path before you.
Using a Cobra MKIII with 7 Ly of jump range was interesting. The bubble, usually seeming very small with modern ships like my "Highway Star" with up to 85 Ly of jump range (if I remove the extra fuel tank), became huge.
You have no idea how huge the bubble is - when experienced in a ship with 7 Ly of jump range. I frequently had to use FSD injection to get anywhere at all.
Shinrarta Dezhra was at a dead end.
And the region around Lave formed a small isolated pocket. There was one route that went a bit further, with a system called "Qube" at its end. Which was very strange, because it was just a star (and two of those modern carriers, by that time).
Why would anybody bother to name a system with just a star in it? And would "Qube" indicate a "Cube", which could be drawn as a hexagon?
