Yes a good point. And if memory serves FD may have said something towards the lines (correct if wrong) 'we know why it hasn't been found', which if correct alludes either to a game mechanism or player behaviour. The rouge planet idea if in game is a great way to obfuscate something.

Maybe the Codex is a clue towards the correct area, as Drew suggested in regards to Tau Ceti, is in fact a strong possibility, we're just using the wrong navigation tool.
Correct me if I'm wrong here (I'm a little confused) but hasn't the nav panel got a max distance of 20 lys or something like for an unselected system with only selected systems showing thats over 20lys away. If i'm right then any unsselected system over 20lys away will not show on the nav panel. So a rogue planet at 40lys away will not show in the nav panel unless it's selected.
