It would've been easier to get info out of the CIA rather than FDev regarding anything RAXXLA. I only asked if it was in game and if it was, was it reachable by commanders now. And all I got was [REDACTED].

We already know that Raxxla is in game, DB has explicitly said so in a livestream (https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/fdev-ed-relevant-quotes-videos.553526/#post-8671776).
Mere repetition of that question is absolutely pointless, it immediately guarantees that any related questions will be ignored, their Chief Executive has spoken and already provided the confirmation.

He also said (at the same time) that we donâ€™t know what it is. We also have an unconfirmed rumour that MB said ages ago that the system in which Raxxla is located was already visited but the pilot did not recognise/detect Raxxla. I think there is sufficient circumstantial support for this rumour that it is reasonably safe to operate on the assumption that it is true (while still retaining some doubt).

Therefore we do need to know that if we find the system that contains Raxxla: (a) we will be able to recognise it somehow-it must have different characteristics from other astronomical bodies, otherwise there is no point in the search and (b) Raxxla itself is not permit locked-IMO there is no point in searching for something that we cannot visit and investigate in detail.
