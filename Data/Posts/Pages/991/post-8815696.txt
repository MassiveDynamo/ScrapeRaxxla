You could be correct distance wise. I’ll double check nav panel unselected system distances. I still think the premise could work even if it’s only 20ly but it would just make searching for a rogue via nav panel more difficult since you only pick up things 20ly away rather than 40ly or whatever the distance is.
Looking on the Nav panel for a Rogue Planet would still be a 1 in a (insert astronomical number here) long shot. Even if you was in the general area of one. If it was me, I would first have to be 1000% sure that I could find one this way before even attempting such a potentially enormous task that could possibly take years.
