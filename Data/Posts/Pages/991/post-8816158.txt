P.S. I think that Raxxla as a rogue planet is a good hypothesis, we have already discussed the possibility many times. It immediately makes it hard to find while staying within the lore and game mechanics. And it might explain how a pilot might visit the system but not recognise Raxxla, though this is a bit suspect-a rogue planet should not have a star, so any pilot who found such a system should have recognised it immediately. The question is: to recognise it as a rogue do we have to manually compare all the systems we see on the nav panel against all nearby systems in galmap? That sounds extremely tedious, error-prone and unenjoyable. I do think it is a good reason why the Tau Ceti fact was given in the Codex; that is the obvious start point for a search. Starship One crash seems to have been sabotage according to galnet so I think that’s a red herring, but what is the location of that incident compared to Tau Ceti, are they reasonably close? Halsey’s last voyage was mentioned in some detail so that could be a clue to something, though not necessarily Raxxla.
