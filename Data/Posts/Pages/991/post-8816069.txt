Nav Panel - Up to 20 LY with a max number of Systems I think, never counted , but often runs out of space before 20LY and for example near Sag A lucky to get 10 LY showing sometimes.....and youd have to know it wasnt showing on the GalMap in the first place wouldnt you?



Can you be more specific? Ive watched that many vids and heard that many theories I cant recall which one that is. Just that Tau Ceti is 1st mention of Raxxla or something else?
Its the simple premise that the mentioning of Tau Ceti date gives us a starting point or a circumstance of influence.

All highly suggestive, and one has to believe that ships had certain restrictions (which I'm doubtful of myself).

Again another potential good question for the AMA... In the years xxxx what was the primary form of interplanetary travel, and what was the max jump range...

Yes the answers are likely in game / lore, but there are so many inconsistencies its difficult to keep track. Again this could rule this out?
