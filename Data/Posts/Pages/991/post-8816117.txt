Yes a good point. And if memory serves FD may have said something towards the lines (correct if wrong) 'we know why it hasn't been found', which if correct alludes either to a game mechanism or player behaviour. The rouge planet idea if in game is a great way to obfuscate something.

Maybe the Codex is a clue towards the correct area, as Drew suggested in regards to Tau Ceti, is in fact a strong possibility, we're just using the wrong navigation tool.

I think the “we know why it hasn’t been found” statement came from Drew Wagar as one possible memory of what DB said to him some time before. Drew seemed a bit hazy on this and gave at least two different recollections where the precise wording changed, so I think it should be treated with low confidence; however in conjunction with the rumour that MB said the Raxxla system had already been visited but Raxxla was not recognised/detected it is suggestive that Raxxla itself is either locked (e.g. Sol/Triton), &/or disguised as an ordinary astronomical object that we will have to investigate in detail in order to recognise it as special.
