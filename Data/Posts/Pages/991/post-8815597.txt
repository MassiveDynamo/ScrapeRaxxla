20lys could still be enough, remember we're looking with eyes from 2020 perspective, closer to launch the galaxy map as I recall it was pretty basic, you couldn't plot very long distances, many of the features we have now originate from Cmdrs feedback.

You then have the issue that FD initially misinterpreted players behaviour, thinking they would travel in a certain pattern rather than fixate on certain systems or patterns of movement. That originally they thought of directing us somehow, to follow missions.

Its not outside the realm ofpossibility.
