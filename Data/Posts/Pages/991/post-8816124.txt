I’m being drawn back into this possible Rogue Planet aspect of the mystery. I read that back in the design discussion forums they outlined that Rogue Planets wouldn’t show up on either the Galaxy Map or FSS, instead you’d need to be in a normal system that was roughly 40ly away from the Rogue Planet, select the Rogue Planet from the nav panel and jump to it.

Can you please give me the quotation for this reference & I’ll add it into the authoritative FD quotes thread.

Though I treat this as suspect since I don’t think the FSS concept existed during the Design Discussion days.
