Maybe this is a viable question to ask in the AMA?

But dont make it about Raxxla

Load the question, you only get one question and its likely going to be a yes or no...so how would you fraise it.... are rouge planets in game....is there a function in game to identify rouge planets?

I agree its a long shot, but an idea is an idea and we have a potential gold mine in the form of an AMA thread. Very likely non of our questions will be answered with any thread of reliability, but its better than nothing and could very well exspand our understanding of various game mechanisms.
