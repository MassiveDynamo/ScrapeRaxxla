I've been tinfoiled hatting with Raxxla a bit lately:

There's a few missions given out by the Dark Wheel from Shinrarta Dezra. These missions reference: A place that isn't a place and 'A Door that is also a Key'
A place that isn't a place often refers to Home is where the heart is, or simply 'Home'
A door that is also a Key, i figured might be a keystone.
As it happens there's a keystone in astronomy in the Hercules Sign (which lorewise is related to the tale of Dionysus):
Location of the KeyStone: 67 Pi Herculis, Eta Herculis, Zeta Herculis, 58 Epsilon Herculis



when the map is locked on earth and turned at the right angle, you get the keystone image (obviously)
So far trying to find a bright star inside the keystone has been problematic, because of its size and apparent distance between stars.

There are some stellar anomalies when you use the Keystone as a view through. Maybe it's wrong, maybe it's a start to the right point.


A new lead! Good job! Even if it turns out not to be right, it has to be followed. Hopefully I will be able to help soon enough...
