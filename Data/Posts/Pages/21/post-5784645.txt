I'm not sure how many of you have read Drew Wagar's latest book Elite: Premonition. The following will be a mild spoiler if you haven't.

It would be very nice to hear directly from Drew on this particular point so we can know for a fact if the intention of Premonition was to basically erase these missions (and any clues from their content) from memory and "reset" the Raxxla mystery in some way

You have to remember that the Dark Wheel are the masters of obfuscation. Misdirection and confusion are definitely their modus operandi. Having people question whether they even exist suits their purposes extremely well. The Dark Wheel faction at Shinrarta Dezhra may be official, or it may not be. You need to ask yourselves whether or not it would suit the purposes of the Dark Wheel to have such an outlet and if they did, to what use would they put it?

Cheers,

Drew.
