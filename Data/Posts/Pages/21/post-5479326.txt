Unfortunately I can't assist with the Elite ranked missions, but did you ever get a pointer as to the co-ordinates from Mission 2? Or is all you got that text from turning in the mission?

Sadly, no further clues could be extracted from the missions. Although the black box salvage gave an audio track, and after hours fiddling with Audiosy?, I managed to get audible audio, but again nothing that could give me other leads.

The Elite missions themselves seems to have stopped, it's been a very long time since I've seen them last, so I think they've been pulled.
