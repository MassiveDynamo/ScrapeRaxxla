Rafe Zetter's remark that Raxxla, if it exists, is in another galaxy got me to thinking recently. How far would you have to travel to reach another galaxy? It turns out to be not that far at all.

The Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy is only 25,000ly from Sol and would be a breeze to reach since it has actually merged with the Milky Way.

If we narrow down the search for Raxxla to this region of space then instead of searching from among 500 billion candidates ... we've narrowed it down to just 1 billion.
