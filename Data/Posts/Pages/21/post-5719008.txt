Haven't seen these missions in a very long time.
And FDev haven't replied with to acknowledge there's a bug or to say "working as intended"... so should we assume that they only become available through other means? E.g. Certain level of faction rep needed? Do these missions now appear as inbox messages when triggered by some in-game event, e.g. USS?

Currently I'm too far away from the bubble to test any of these theories.
