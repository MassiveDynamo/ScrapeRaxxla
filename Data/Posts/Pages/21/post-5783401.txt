Hidden away somewhere in the Exploration subthread I started a discussion about a possible expedition to locate ancient stars.

As I've said elsewhere ... I have a feeling that Raxxla (if it is a place) is older then the universe itself. There is a class of stars known as "Population III" stars. One of the goals of the James Webb Space Telescope is to find evidence of these stars ... stars who's existence dates back almost to the Big Bang itself. These are massive metal-poor stars with an age nearing 14 billion years.

I believe that Raxxla will be found orbiting a metal rich star that is older than what is possible given current theories regarding the age of the universe and that the "gate" on that world was used to shove Raxxla and its parent star back into the distant past. It's great age would be the result of having traveled through the eons twice.

It is, of course, pure conjecture. A guess. Gut instinct. The quest has to start somewhere.

Part of the problem with that is that even the Oldest Known Stars that are in the game(For Example HD 140283) the age of the star is not accurate to real life estimates when I visited it a couple month's back. Few others have the same problem. But I suppose you can happen on a Procedural one that is extremely old beyond the age of the known universe
