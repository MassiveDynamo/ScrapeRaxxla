Rafe Zetter's remark that Raxxla, if it exists, is in another galaxy got me to thinking recently. How far would you have to travel to reach another galaxy? It turns out to be not that far at all.
The Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy is only 25,000ly from Sol and would be a breeze to reach since it has actually merged with the Milky Way.
If we narrow down the search for Raxxla to this region of space then instead of searching from among 500 billion candidates ... we've narrowed it down to just 1 billion.

To my knowledge, the CMa Overdensity is heavily disputed. In recent years theories have shifted towards a stream of stars that wraps around the Milky Way multiple times, called the Monoceros Ring. However, current theories hold that the ring-like structure (and three other structures) are simply parts of the tidal stream of the spiral arms in a previously unmeasured density. The theory behind this is called the Corrugated Galaxy.

So the CMa Overdensity is far from certain and it's even more uncertain if the structures in the CMa constellation are of extra-galactic origin.

The Children of Raxxla have conducted a special Monoceros Mission in June 3303 to survey parts of the overdensity's area and data is still being analyzed. However, as of now, no oddities or unusual concentrations of anomalous stars have been found yet.
