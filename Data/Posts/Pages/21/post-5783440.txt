Part of the problem with that is that even the Oldest Known Stars that are in the game(For Example HD 140283) the age of the star is not accurate to real life estimates when I visited it a couple month's back. Few others have the same problem. But I suppose you can happen on a Procedural one that is extremely old beyond the age of the known universe

Yes. There are a few things "wrong" about the Elite: Dangerous galaxy and I've been informed that there was a time when stars older than the universe were fairly prevalent via stellar forge. I've been told that Frontier fixed those anomalies that resulted in some stars being older than 14 billion years so, presumably, if we were to stumble upon a Pop III or older star it would be "legitimate".

I've yet to test this myself. I believe that there are a few stars registered in EDSM that had an age greater then the age of the universe. I'm planning on visiting those to see for myself if Frontier fixed them or not.
