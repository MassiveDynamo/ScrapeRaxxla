I've been tinfoiled hatting with Raxxla a bit lately:

There's a few missions given out by the Dark Wheel from Shinrarta Dezra. These missions reference: A place that isn't a place and 'A Door that is also a Key'
A place that isn't a place often refers to Home is where the heart is, or simply 'Home'
A door that is also a Key, i figured might be a keystone.
As it happens there's a keystone in astronomy in the Hercules Sign (which lorewise is related to the tale of Dionysus):
Location of the KeyStone: 67 Pi Herculis, Eta Herculis, Zeta Herculis, 58 Epsilon Herculis

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercules_(constellation)

when the map is locked on earth and turned at the right angle, you get the keystone image (obviously)
So far trying to find a bright star inside the keystone has been problematic, because of its size and apparent distance between stars.

There are some stellar anomalies when you use the Keystone as a view through. Maybe it's wrong, maybe it's a start to the right point.
