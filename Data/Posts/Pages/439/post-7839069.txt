This is about an hour of exploring those areas around the Orion nebula, where some of the more intense frame shift jump spinning takes place for me. Sorry for it only being 360 quality. Around 4:08 is one of those jumps we're talking about. Sadly galnews prevents any voices from beyond from being noticed by me.

Time a jump in the bubble and time one from your video, personally it seems you where in that tunnel longer than you should have been
Could be a clue?
