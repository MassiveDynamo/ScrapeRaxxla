Just for reference, Col 70 is roughly spherical and about 1,000 ly in diameter. Just so you know the kind of distances you're looking at!

Which part of the Col 70 border have you been checking?

Without being at home and going in the PC (game) to check to give u the rundown of what im doing, im running for some days now on the bottom area, below the sectors, last sector was the Olo... something (cant recall from head the correct name), heading in the Synuefe general direction now.
