So, interestingly... they may be bugged. I went back to TDW and looked at some cargo missions.
It's not just an "Elite" thing either... they also offered some other missions which just had the "Elite" rank req. Maybe a bugreport is due...
A new bug report about the E/F missions can't do any harm. FD is used to, they'll survive.
Now, it's interesting to see that the word "Founders" is back. Not sure up to what point, though.
Anyway, the fact that some missions are reserved to Elite and others to Elite and Founders is quite a point ! Imho.
Be aware that the ancient missions were more likely given by other factions, aimed at doing espionnage on TDW suspect activities.
