This is about an hour of exploring those areas around the Orion nebula, where some of the more intense frame shift jump spinning takes place for me. Sorry for it only being 360 quality. Around 4:08 is one of those jumps we're talking about. Sadly galnews prevents any voices from beyond from being noticed by me.

Yeah. There's definitely nothing out of the ordinary with the jumps at a basic level I'm afraid.

Now if someone's able to prove a causal link to something for those jumps it would be interesting. That's going to take a lot of checking from a good number of people though, and I'd be surprised if it's not all been tested before.
