Talking of old Rifters, are the Children of Raxxla still an active PMF? They pretty much abandoned/boycotted the official forums after the Salome debacle, probably due to the abusive s**tshow the forums descended into after some people didn't like the way the endgame panned out. There were/are a bunch of smart people in that group with a lot of good ideas. I miss having them around to (RP) argue with.

AfaIk they are still around and will be launching some kind of Community wide effort in July.
