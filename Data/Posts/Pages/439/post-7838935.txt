Just for reference, Col 70 is roughly spherical and about 1,000 ly in diameter. Just so you know the kind of distances you're looking at!

Which part of the Col 70 border have you been checking?
Watch my video I posted here. That's the region col 70 sectors near Orion nebula and Barnard's loop. Again sorry for the poor quality.
