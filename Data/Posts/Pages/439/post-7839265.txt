The only thing about the hyperspace jump cinematic I’ve noticed is the strange dark looking planet you can sometimes see wiz by you. Usually on your right side. I posted some screenshots a while back. I don’t think it’s too outrageous to believe the jump animation can hold clues as there is plenty of evidence that witch space holds secrets. I’ve been trying to figure out how one can enter witch space without a jump. I think that it’s slightly plausible that there might be an opening in space somewhere in the Galaxy that lets you enter witch space while in SC or just normal flying. If thargoids can do it, maybe we can too?
