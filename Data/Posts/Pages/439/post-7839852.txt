I believe the implication of this was that all the unknown permit sectors are in the dark spots of the raxxla image. probably not the entire dark spots. I'm sure one could resize it to fit perfectly, but who knows?
There are many permit locked regions not covered by the six dark blocks in the Raxxla image in the image you show and even if you re-oriented or re-sized it a little I don't think it would add more than one or two. The ones it seems to miss out the most are NGC 2286, Bleia, Praei, Bovomit, Sidgoir and IC 4673. It might just about be getting, or could be re-oriented to get, Froadik and Dryman, but the only regions is gets for sure (Barnards' Loop regions, including the Cone Sector, excluded) to my eye are Hyponia and NGC 3603.

The permit locked regions were, according to the kickstarter videos, always intended to be where new content could be added at a later date. I suspect that their locations were chosen so as to allow for content to be added to different parts of the galaxy and in regions that are also diverse with respect to each other (e.g. Bleia has a high star density and even completely contains a large nebula but Bovomit and Sidgoir are sparse by comparison being on the New Outer Arm).
