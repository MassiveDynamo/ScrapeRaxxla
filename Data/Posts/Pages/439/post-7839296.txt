Idk if this plot is still running, though. But an interesting system with "science research" stations (Talos, like the giant bronze man in Greek myth).
Never figured out what they are/were "researching"...
Our excellent and long time disappeared fellow threader from the FR mYsTeRy forum, Cmdr LuckyLuke, had been surveying it for months.
Yep, pilgrim. And.. yes, a supposedly plagued planet forbidden to be approached in a system called Peregrina might very well suit an enlightened pilgrim on the run .
If interested, https://inara.cz/squadron/2176/ Lot of interesting people, there. And plagued with CoR moles too. Which usually is a good sign.
