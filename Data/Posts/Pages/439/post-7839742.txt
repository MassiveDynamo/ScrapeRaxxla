Has anyone looked into the odd permit order - and why it forces them to be in the order they are in after you get all 26? I have been looking into this for weeks- and can post here, unless someone has a good answer as to why they are like they are?

I believe the implication of this was that all the unknown permit sectors are in the dark spots of the raxxla image. probably not the entire dark spots. I'm sure one could resize it to fit perfectly, but who knows?
