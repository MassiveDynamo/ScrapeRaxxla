Finally reached The Void just now. I notice there is a sector in this region called Phaa Chrie, which phonetically might be read as 'Far Cry', so it sounds ideal to look for a siren of the deepest void. It may take me a while to reach as crossing the gap to the Sagittarius Carina Arm from where I am on the edge of the Outer Arm may require a detour through The Conduit.
