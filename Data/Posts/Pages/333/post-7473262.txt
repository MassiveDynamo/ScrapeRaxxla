I’ve wondered myself if the gaurdian stuff may hold a clue. Raxxla has alien stuff on it and the guardians are one of but two known sentient alien races in ED.
The shape of their ruins (and the map that represented them) has always been of interest to me. There seems to be something more deleiberate to its design other than its “cool alien looking”. The design certainly seems to incorporate symbols we’ve seen in maps before, could be that their ruins are a map of their home system and has clues about how to find it.

Guardian AI tech could fit into Raxxla story - ancient alien technology. I also suspect of reusing that design for planting locations in the game.

The problem here is that the design of Guardians art and architecture is inspired from 4D perspective (no if and why). To translate it to 3D layout would be epic effort, and I think it is not worthy. Better to keep an eye on symbolism.

A CMDR Darkyason already reported a new finding close to Col 70. For now, I am curious if new types of guardian ruins will pop-up nearby.
