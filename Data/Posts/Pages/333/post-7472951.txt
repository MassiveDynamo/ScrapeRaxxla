BTW, the planet will be actually called Raxxla, right?

If you are asking if it will appear as Raxxla in your NavPanel... Would be kind of nonsense for an unregistered mythical planet. Wouldn't it ?
But with FD ... Who knows?

Is there any clue / evidence that Raxxla is "cloaked" or otherwise hidden, like the mythical planet of Aldea in ST-TNG, and thus requires some sort of "key" to reveal it, or could we find it through a "brute force attack" and / or "dumb luck" (scanning every single system in a growing sphere centered on Sol) using regular exploration tools?

We were told where Raxxla roughly is and why it's difficult to find.
Obfuscated in the outer rim.
I doubt the crappy FSS minigame will be of any use. I hope it will not.

Btw.. Almost forgot your welcome gift:

Someone also said that FDev said to "Follow the missions".

Yes, the E/F missions. They represent, imho, the "tiny bit obvious" part of this mess.
But they were taken off.
Our excellent fellow threader and thread Boss, Macros, was coming too close and too early to find Raxxla.
His fault !!
