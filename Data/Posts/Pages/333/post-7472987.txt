There is a large paragraph in a small codex entry dedicated to Cora and Art, so there has to be more to it than the date 2296...

One thing , though , it goes against the 'R was in from the beginning' statement as it would need Horizons.

The way I look at it, the Codex is an additional set of clues, so it can involve Horizons because we can go digging for clues on planets and still find a pointer to a Raxxla that's perfectly discoverable "the old way" (by sheer luck or whatever).

Anyway, 2296 either coordinates (22, 96) on that planet with the pirate stash, or (if it skips a paragraph), sonnets 22 and 96 in the Astrophel / Stella thing.
