For those interested in the Odysseus connections.
Both sites really cool to visit. I especially liked the Expedition vessel as it's very unique.

Gen Ship Odysseus: https://canonn.science/codex/generation-ship-odysseus/

Expedition Vessel Odysseus: https://canonn.science/codex/expedition-vessel-odysseus/

There is a book called: The Four-Dimensional Journey of Odysseus Through Space and Time.
https://books.google.no/books?id=Mbc...20rift&f=false

It tries to mach all the mythical islands of the odyssey with real stars. I have only read the parts that are available on Google books, but it seem interesting.
