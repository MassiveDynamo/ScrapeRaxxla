Sorry if anyone has covered this previously...but to continue the literary analysis of Astrophel & Stella against Greek mythology.

'Allusions are a distinguishing feature of sir Philip Sydney's sonnet sequence 'Astrophel and Stella' Elaborate.'

'With eyes to see' - does this allude to a classical analysis of the text, to extract classical names used in astronomical navigation or a Homeric journey?
