There is a book called: The Four-Dimensional Journey of Odysseus Through Space and Time.

It tries to mach all the mythical islands of the odyssey with real stars. I have only read the parts that are available on Google books, but it seem interesting.

Excellent find...I'm reminded that this may have been my initial spark of interest...it has been proposed previously in this thread.

The plot thickens. Me thinks this could herald something.
