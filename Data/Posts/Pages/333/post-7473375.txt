Just a thought that came into my mind:
Were we supposed to be able to find Raxxla from the very beginning of the game?

Because

If that is the case, anything that got added later immediatly get's crossed out.
Meaning no Guardian relics are required to find it, not the new scanners, not anything that can be found on planetary surfaces as back then we couldn't land on them yet.
That also includes all stations, ships, signal sources, commodities and mission types that got added to the game later.
