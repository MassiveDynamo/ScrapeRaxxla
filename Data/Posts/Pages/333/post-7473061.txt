Some people think Astrophel and Stella is irl version of Princess Astrophil and the Spiralling Stars.

Funny thing is it refers Astrophil as a princess and in plain english then Prince and describes Spiralling Stars without using any Latin/Greek phrases. Considering the book itself would of been pronounced in a different native language of the writer.

I would like to add that the word Spiralling Stars are a certain class of star Wolf-Rayet Star and not all spiral there are some that do.

The biggest highlighted discovery of a spiralling star is WR-104

Edit:

Looking through edsm there aren't many Wolf-Rayet Stars on the system there are actually very few in the galaxy that are currently discovered.

Edit Went to Gliese 293 looking for anything interesting ran into a Eagle which had one weird title called Private Security it was yellow and wasn't based on the system itself before it disappeared either completely stop out of super cruise or jumped.

Edit 2: Found a interesting Nav Beacon 26.6 LS away from the star Gliese 293 B which is funny how far that it is compared to most Nav Beacons but it just could be the fact on how huge the star is.
