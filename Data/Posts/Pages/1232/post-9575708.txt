we know is a likely member is Liz Ryder (familial links), but that seems too obvious. I'm intrigued that both Felicity and Elvira (both offering G5 FSD upgrades) have "far sight" in common.

Drew said the lore he received (Allen Stroud's 6 volumes! I'm up to appendix C in his PhD thesis which presents more of that lore and a couple of short stories (entertaining, but incomplete!)) said SD TDW was a front, but didnt clarify if they were just chancers or a front for the TDW themselves. For storyline reasons he chose the latter. Could still be true- FD let his interpretation through proofreading and publication! (i.e. EITHER they agreed OR it's immaterial & tTDW in SD are just a red herring). The codex speech by Felicity says chancers are closed down rapidly (how does she know? to my mind inside information & she's a member!) and the SD faction are still going strong after several years!

I welcome any comments on those 7 analysis points I raised this morning!

In the codex, Flis does say "shut down quietly", which is consistent with them being turned into a shell or front only. A large portion of the text is used to cast doubt on the Shindez organisation, and I suspect this is to explain the disappearance of the E/F missions.
