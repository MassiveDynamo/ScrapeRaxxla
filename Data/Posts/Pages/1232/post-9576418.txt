Yes, there was a station at the memorial “
Tethered below this vast, rotating mausoleum is the dodecahedral shape of a 'Dodo' class space station, the home of the Cemetery Authorites.
”

Have a search through Premonition. Pretty sure Luko said to Hassan that TDW HQ had existed for a while in Tionisla. Since Rebecca clearly was in TDW I assumed that was a reference to her old cobra. Her ship was added into the mausoleum by special request to the authorities & then she was killed in it by The Club mercs.
