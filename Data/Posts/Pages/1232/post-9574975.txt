I think you’re on to something. The family connection is relevant I’m certain.

As you fit the potential prerequisites it stands no harm in reaching out to FD just to clarify, we only assume the invite works, it could be bugged!

In RL that would be called a key intelligence relationship node. It doesn’t tell us who is in charge but these ‘nominals’ can be mapped (link analysis) to identify potential modus operandi or even intelligence gaps.

But this is a game, so in-game mechanisms ought to play a part. There is also the issue RL writers may not understand RL human behaviour and have unintentionally convoluted the issue.

In RL humans are shockingly complacent, relationships do tell us something about who does what and where…

Exploration and building relationships with the Ryders; it’s a good direction.
