I do agree with the Dark Wheel invite idea, it’s a logical and elegant solution; however what could the prerequisites be?

We’ve been here before, but sometimes the simplest solution is the most elegant, unless of course FD changed the process (I’m a little bit suspicious).

It stands to reason the invite was possibly tired to SD and TDW, I presume the test was the older DW missions about the data crystals. But that’s by-the-by because from all evidence they no longer exist.

It’s possible the invite was therefore broken; later fixed or removed; we will never know.

Maybe the prerequisites for an invite are straightforward; get to Elite, go build reputation with TDW and get an invite.

However, we have the suspicion the TDW in SD is bogus (only brought in by the introduction of the Codex- then later confirmed by Drew). If that is the case - where to now?

If the above simple solution still holds, and FD simply amended the invite (not move it) then all one needs to do is get to Elite and grind out all reputations with all SD factions.

If that fails then it’s either broken, moved elsewhere (!) or simply no longer / never existed?

Rember FD last comms with me “we leave such discovery to the adventurous endeavors of our esteemed Commanders and intrepid explorers!”.

Maybe it is (or was) tied to exploration, maybe they binned the invite, or maybe we just have to find it!

I would propose any Cmdr with triple Elite and full reputations in SD ought to report it as a bug, not to ask for help but maybe write in a loaded question…any feedback may allude to something- it may not.
