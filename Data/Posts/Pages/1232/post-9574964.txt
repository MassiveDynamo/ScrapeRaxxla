Sigh, Update 8 stops play! so I'll respond

I'm triple Elite, Admiral and King, Allied with ALL SD factions...no sign of a TDW membership test! Tha's what prompted me to go back to the codex entry and try to do an analysis of the wording to see if FD had obfuscated something.

I suspect Raxxla was originally just an Easter Egg for anyone randomly to find, then they decided to make it a storyline in its own right and that's behind the "personal journey" quote; the achievement of SD permit through Elite rank seems to be significant in that (access to SD system itself? or access to PF & TDW factions??). I suspect those old E/F SD missions were red herrings and someone thought they would get too much salt when that became known. I suspect the test IS accessible somehow, just don't know how. But some interesting things came out in my analysis this morning. The only person we know is a likely member is Liz Ryder (familial links), but that seems too obvious. I'm intrigued that both Felicity and Elvira (both offering G5 FSD upgrades) have "far sight" in common.

Drew said the lore he received (Allen Stroud's 6 volumes! I'm up to appendix C in his PhD thesis which presents more of that lore and a couple of short stories (entertaining, but incomplete!)) said SD TDW was a front, but didnt clarify if they were just chancers or a front for the TDW themselves. For storyline reasons he chose the latter. Could still be true- FD let his interpretation through proofreading and publication! (i.e. EITHER they agreed OR it's immaterial & tTDW in SD are just a red herring). The codex speech by Felicity says chancers are closed down rapidly (how does she know? to my mind inside information & she's a member!) and the SD faction are still going strong after several years!

I welcome any comments on those 7 analysis points I raised this morning!
