'You seem to know a lot about all this ...'

'I know my history, signor,' Luko said, tapping the side of his nose with a finger. 'This Dark Wheel, they appear and they disappear. Whenever a crisis occurs, there they are. For hundreds of years they have been turning the pages of the story. The Tionisla system is steeped in mucho ancient lore.' He shrugged. 'And now they take Salom√© into their world, eh?'

Only ref I can find. The context is that Hassan has taken Salome to Tionisla orbital graveyard. So no ref to TDW HQ, only that Tionisla is important in history - the graveyard is a central theme to Drew and appears frequently in Premonition, and is also mentioned briefly in Reclamation. This being a nod to ch3 in TDW novella. But nowhere does it mention TDW headquaters as far as I can see.
