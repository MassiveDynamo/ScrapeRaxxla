It's not known. Many set it shortly before the the start of Elite in 3125. Others say it must be quite a bit earlier, because they use the Faraway jump system. In the game you can jump from anywhere. It's probably a 'Based on RL events and persons' story, within the ED galaxy. It's not to be taken literally.

One could try to track the Ryder lineage and find an approximate maximum age for the events in TDW.
Where is the 3125 date coming from? I really need to put together a proper annotated timelineâ€¦ trying to keep all this in my head isnt working
