And maybe rep building with factions in Sol & the Old Worlds where TDW likely originated since they've been in space exploration from the beginning (oooh, is that a reference to Sirius or some other commercial entity???)

My net connection is playing up - the bugs in EDO Update 6 are emerging early!

edit: I've got the Sirius permit so must be Allied with them..maybe need to do some rep building in the Old Worlds. The "intended" gameplay route would likely have led to this!
