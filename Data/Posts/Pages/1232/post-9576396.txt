Are those guidebooks available anywhere?
Not by us directly, but he seems to have put a lot of the lore documentation as examples in his PhD thesis appendices

Edit: mind, FD could have retconned the heck out of it!!!

Was going to ping you-have you (or anyone else) done an analysis of the missions offered by PF and TDW in Shinrarta? If it is a front run by the real DW then I’d expect a few of those missions to direct the player towards the real DW faction. That would be consistent with DB sayings about we dont play the game as they expected & he knows there are missions that nobody has seen (because of that unexpected gameplay). Think we were supposed to follow the missions so some of them should be leads. Sorting the wheat from the chaff might be difficult though. Clearly the “personal journey we all must undertake” took us to Elite and SD permit, so there must be something that follows that stage using the game mechanics
