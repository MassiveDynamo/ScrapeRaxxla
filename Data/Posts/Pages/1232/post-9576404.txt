There was a station run by the Memorial Authorities in Holdstock’s book, dont think that was a Coriolis. Seem to remember it was at the heart of the rotating memorial, which sadly is not in-game.
Drew had “TDW HQ” in the Tionisla Memorial-which I think was Rebecca’s old Cobra!
Not sure thats quite straight. The Tionisla Orbital Graveyard was curated by the Tionisla HIstorical Society. Rebecca's old cobra was just one of the memorials, no HQ, and was specially added by request to THS (in Premonition). Alex Ryder steals a ship from there in the original novella along with Terogian clone Elyssia Fields and then rendezvous with Rafe Zetter a tenth of a ly away in open space.
