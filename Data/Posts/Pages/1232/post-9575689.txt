Was just thinking about the dark wheel base … didnt Drew say in his book it used to be in Tionisla? Was it supposed to be in the Graveyard? Cant remember now.
There was a station run by the Memorial Authorities in Holdstock’s book, dont think that was a Coriolis. Seem to remember it was at the heart of the rotating memorial, which sadly is not in-game.
Drew had “TDW HQ” in the Tionisla Memorial-which I think was Rebecca’s old Cobra!
