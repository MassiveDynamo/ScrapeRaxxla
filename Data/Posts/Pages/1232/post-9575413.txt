Where is the 3125 date coming from? I really need to put together a proper annotated timeline… trying to keep all this in my head isnt working
I’ve already started, using Wiki Timeline and Allen Stroud’s PhD thesis appendices. I have 3120 for the original Elite, so I guess Holdstock is about the same date.
