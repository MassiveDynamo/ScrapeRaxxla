This mention of making themselves known to you is intriguing...dont we have a now ingame story arc with a certain individual making themselves slowly known to us and using the same sort of wording in their messages, also they dont like AEGIS(New found INRA) much like the Dark Wheel didnt like INRA, I am willing to bet this is the tied story arc to a permit zone where the Dark Wheel station resides, after all remember Cone nebula has a system with a population at one stage and marked as independent though still unreachable
