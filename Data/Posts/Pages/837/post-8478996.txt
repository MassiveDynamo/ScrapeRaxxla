Yesterday i learned you can actually initiate a misjump. We were fighting goids in a wing out near asterope. Because of wing bugs one of our squad kept blue screening out of game (ps4) as soon as the jump would start. any ways the first time when he logged back in he was 34k ls out into his destination system. The second time he was in a nearby system just a jump away but a completely wrong system from where he was targeting. Each of these jumps were only a few ly away, 10 max. Imagine if it were a neutron boost jump....

I know game closing is against the rules for pvp but i wonder how this counts if one were to intentionally close the app to create misjumps.
