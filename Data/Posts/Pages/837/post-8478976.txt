I would imagine sorting through 16000+ posts to find something we already know, would take as long as actually finding Raxxla itself and no one felt the need to convince someone else of what we already knew for our selfves. We have enough wild geese to chase that havent already been confirmed tyvm.

It took me almost 4 days to catch up on this thread when i first joined it about 400 pages ago.
