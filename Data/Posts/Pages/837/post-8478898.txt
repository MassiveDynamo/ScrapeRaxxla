That image was posted a while ago and already parsed through. They probably just didn't want to repeat what was already done.

Let it go man.

Sure, its let go, but lastly, I did ask yesterday for a link to where it was previously discussed before the arguments, as I would gladly have read the previous discussions, and wasnt given one.


Anyways, this game has thrown plenty of curve-balls at us that to discount somthing based on "font" or somthing, just seemed unfair to the game.

We have commets that dont render but their gavity effects are present, we have orbital dynamics running, which my freiend who turned me onto ED and has been playing ALOT longer than me, insisted were NOT acitive in the game, until I googled and took him to some system with a landable moon that orbits its planet like every 32secs or somthing, than he finally agreed things like stations are acutally orbiting, but he insisted they didnt actually move, and hes been playing a long time before me and even turned me onto Raxxla...

Bottom line is, length of experience playing the game, doesnt make you automatically right, you could play the game for years and know nothing, or 1 month and know everything most players know, but there is never a reason to insist your correct when you cant or wont backup your claims, thats called arrogance.
