I've looked into this several times over the ~12 months I've been playing. Undoubtedly covering a lot of ground already discounted elsewhere and my efforts pale into comparison of others. Having tried numerous approaches these are the six I remember

6 Using the "six clues" as locations to progress to something else
This feels like the most likely solution that I've seen, wish I'd thought of it

I'm not certain of any of the six clue answers, although I suspect Maia is the whisperer
Am thinking each answer is unlikely to be in a "No system description is available" system
Searching for Raxxla may mean I never find it, but doing something else may unlock it

I think, if this is a toast by the Real Dark Wheel, then it makes more sense for it to be said while standing at a dinner table and raising their glasses in several directions (either 3 or 6). With the last line “To Raxxla” being a last slurp to something they’ve been searching for a long time. Hence it is more likely to be centred on their dark station than being directions to Raxxla. Thinking logically!
