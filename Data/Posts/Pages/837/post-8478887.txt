Man ...there are numbers on picture -
1. distance to target
2. time to target calculated by game
3. ship speed

Now, check number (2) yourself using (1) and (3).

Oh I agree with you NOW, but that wasnt really explained yesterday when the "dissagreements" occured.... it was insisted that the font and font alone discredited the img
Also, some else mentioned here, its possible unknown gravitational objects could be effecting the time/distance calculation, just saying.... so that as well isnt neccessarily a 100% proof of fake.... itrs better than just yelling, the font is wrong! but still not what I would have considered a 100% de-bunk....

Now @FullM3talX , he gave enough proof and method of proof for me to put the subject to bed. its a fake. the dyson sphere being from google, thats undeniable. Everything else was and is kinda just personal interpretation and opinions....and I only say that becuase its extremely unlikely that the devs took a google img, and converted it into an in-game asset... not impossible, but unlikey as that COULD raise copywright and other issues, not too mention they have a asset builder tool box for building the game, they wouldnt really have a need for google imgs, they get imgs from NASA ect...
