Just a suggestion to whom ever maintains the main page of this thread, perhaps adding a "De-Bunked" section would be prudent?
So that future readers can have a place to review previously de-bunked informations, such as this previous img.
At least a repository of links to where in this thread or other threads previous issues were de-bunked.....

I know there could be potentially every theory anyone has ever given listed, but I dont mean to go that far, just large issues like Hoaxed imgs in regards to Raxxla or TDW, in-game abilities like accessing permit locked systems like Polaris, that we all know is unatainable in any way, or Thargoid facts if someone claims they relate to Raxxla, ect.....

Just an idea.....
