I think, if this is a toast by the Real Dark Wheel, then it makes more sense for it to be said while standing at a dinner table and raising their glasses in several directions (either 3 or 6). With the last line “To Raxxla” being a last slurp to something they’ve been searching for a long time. Hence it is more likely to be centred on their dark station than being directions to Raxxla. Thinking logically!
I have fancied the treasure map for a long time, as you know. To me, it makes sense given "what once was lost will soon be found", etc. Still have the map but whoever's knew how to read it has died????
