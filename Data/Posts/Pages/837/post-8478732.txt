Getting a sensei vibe from you there @Jorki Rasalas . Was waiting for "To find Raxxla....You must become Raxxla" or "To find what is truly lost you must also be truly lost. Only then both you and what you seek will be truely found"

Well, O Be One Jorki sounds a bit too aspirational, or derogatory!
But your second point is well made.
Perhaps we need to log into ship, close our eyes, do random jumps to random destinations and
Find Raxxla
Or die horribly in a starâ€™s corona...
I think the latter is more likely with my reflexes
And the amount of lavian brandy I consume! At least it would be quick!
