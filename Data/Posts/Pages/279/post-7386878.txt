*tinfoil* Back to the place that is no place and the whisperer in witchspace... As stated earlier the place that is no place can be seen as the place in between. I wrote about that when posting my Avalon theory (disapproved).

However I once read a book by German Ethnologist Hans Peter Duerr (Traumzeit. Ãœber die Grenzen zwischen Wildnis und Zivilisation - rough translation: Dreamtime concerning the borders between the wild and civilization). Some part of the book is about the place that is no place in mythology and about the person guarding it: The Hagazussa (today hag. See for Etymology here: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexe#Etymologie and sorry there is no english version of this wiki entry but french, russian and spanish are provided.). The Hagazussa is basically a witch. The Wiki I just quoted states that amongst the first witches to be mentioned was Circe. What a fine whisperer in witchspace she could be... Btw. There is a System near Sol named Circe. As I'm currentyl gathering guardian stuff I won't be able to go there soon. Would be glad if anyone going that way could take a look.

*tinfoil off*
