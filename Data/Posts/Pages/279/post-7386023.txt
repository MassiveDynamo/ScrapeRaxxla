Im not too sure if this station is more reasonable. Dont you think this station is too close to the sun because we know it orbits the 8. moon of a gas giant.It should be further away from the sun, not?

We've done some research based on that Codex picture. The biggest problem is we don't know the parameters of the "camera" the picture was taken with. It could be cropped from a much wider angle picture, taken from different distances etc. If we assume the FOV is anything close to the default in-game FOV, that station would have to be either very close to the star or the star would have to be very big.

I've queried the EDSM database for gas giants with 8+ moons and sorted them by estimated angular diameter of the star as seen from the gas giant's location*. Within 1200ly of Sol there are only a few candidates that could produce the image from the Codex, but they all have the wrong spectral type or are too hot or too cold to be the right color.

*NOTE: this is not possible for all systems in the EDSM db, some of the are missing data; in other cases involving binary+ systems and bodies orbiting barycenters instead of other bodies it becomes very hard to estimate the angular diameter of stars.
