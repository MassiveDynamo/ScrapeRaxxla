thats realy interesting. in english also Moon. Hmmpff
so i must be wrong because it's a translation mistake.

here is the litle fragment text in german

...dass die ursprÃ¼ngliche Gruppe ihre Basis an Bord eine verlassenen Sternenhafens hatte, der um den achten Planeten eines namenlosen Gasriesen kreist.

what i can see too is, "eine" its not correct, it must be sounds like "eines". because "Sternenhafens" has the "s" at the end.

thx for the answer

Cant currently get on to rewrite the text, but it does seem like a translation error in the German text.
