Ive already said it in the canonn discord but i dont believe the start screen menu is a real place in game because no matter how you place yourself, as long as the constalation is more or less correct you will allways have barnards loop in your picture.



The second picture is made around 150ly from sol in direction barnards loop. The only other way that the constelation would match with the start screen would be if you look at barnards from the "opposite site" so you would fly to barnards loop and them some 150-250 ly further in this direction but you would have the same problem that barnards loop is in the picture.
I dont think its a real playce in game. Or would it be possible for FD to "remove" barnards loop for the start screen so its not totaly obvious where it is?

Please don't get too hung up on the constellation being Orion, that was a total stab in the dark on my part and most likely incorrect. Especially since the colors of the some of the stars I proposed don't much their spectral types.

The menu image could still be useful. If we can identify the system it was taken in, at the very least we can conclusively disprove and close this line of reasoning. I'm currently investigating a few possibilities as to what stars could be in the image, I'll report once I get some solid results either way.
