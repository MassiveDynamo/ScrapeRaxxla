An ancient Go-Pro...

I didn't realise (as am not Elite yet) that there's a Gas Giant in the Dark Wheel home system with a port around its 8th Moon (pretty sure someone mentioned this is the case). For me, this has to be the reference from the Codex. Figuring out what to do there is the next step to finding Raxxla imo.

It's on the 8th moon. It's a surface base.
