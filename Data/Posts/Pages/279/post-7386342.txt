Its an trap with that Gas Giant 8+ Moons

In my language (its german) we will read in the codex "Planets" but no Moon or Moons.

litle question from me: - what is reading in your language (Moon or Planet) ?

and so im wondred me about that Codex text because an Planet like Jupiter (Gas Gigant) have only Moons and no Planets.
And an Gas Gigant like Jupiter is not the only one that we can calling Gas Gigant.

Any Sun is an Gas Gigant too. but this Gigant lit (eLITe = e lit e)

It is an unnamed Sun with 8+ Planets.
So the codex text is correct and true.

I'd be interested to see the German text too. English text states 8th moon of a Gas Giant. Just off to walk the dogs so will try and copy and paste later.
