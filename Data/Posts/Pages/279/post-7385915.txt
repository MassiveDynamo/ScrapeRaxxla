I assume the image in the codex shows the dark wheel station, because otherwise it would be silly to include it there. The image shows a red star, the horizon menu shows a white or bright blue star. I don't believe that FD would manually change the colour of the star in one of the images to "just" make it less obvious and harder to find. That would be totally stupid.
