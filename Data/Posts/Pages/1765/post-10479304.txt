Nobody ever do that in game development. All what you see in game is stored on your local machine hard drive.
Its would be encrypted or have different name but game model should be in game files. If its never been found i guess that there are no secret model in game after all.

maybe it's some kind of reward as paint for cobra mk 3 or something. Cant believe that in 10 years nobody found it
I don't think that's true as it's already been done in ED. As I understand it while the universe is held in code in each player's machine, and expanded for loading during the "hyperspace jump" sequence, hand-crafted systems and poi are downloaded. During the Formidine Rift search (in-game development of Drew Wagar's Reclamation book) many of us had the game crash to desktop because there was a programming problem in downloading the FRift bases from the server.
