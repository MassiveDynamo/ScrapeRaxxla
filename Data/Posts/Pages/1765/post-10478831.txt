Are these the same data miners that failed to discover any actual ships - including the Python 2, Type-8, Mandalay or Cobra V - in advance of their official announcements, but have been assuring us that the Panther Clipper / on-foot Thargoids / etc have been coming for years?

Because if so that's probably the strongest evidence yet that Raxxla is in the game.


Indeed - the difference in years between "first written reference to Earth's Moon" and "first person visits Earth's Moon" is even longer than the gap between Raxxla's first mention and ED's present day.

Though on-tentacle Thargoids did seem to be a thing from an "FD-leaked pic". Funnily enough I was wondering only yesterday why that never happened, when with Odyssey humans can be seen perambulating on planets. Could be FD thought that however they made the goids look they would get loads of salty flak from players who imagined something entirely different (the OOTD description doesnt bear any resemblance to that pic as far as I could see!); could be it's still scheduled as part of the goid storyline- although xeno combat no longer interests me, does anyone else feel the mooted "end of the thargoid war" might be a little premature? Maybe those locked areas out towards Beagle Point will open and hordes of insectoid adults will rain down upon us, perhaps we've so far only seen the larval stages!
