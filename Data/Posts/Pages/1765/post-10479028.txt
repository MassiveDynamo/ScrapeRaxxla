No reason it should! FD aren't stupid, they would have taken steps to prevent file mining.
It can be kept on FD servers and downloaded to the player's machine on entering the Omphalos Rift gateway to it.

Nobody ever do that in game development. All what you see in game is stored on your local machine hard drive.
Its would be encrypted or have different name but game model should be in game files. If its never been found i guess that there are no secret model in game after all.

maybe it's some kind of reward as paint for cobra mk 3 or something. Cant believe that in 10 years nobody found it
