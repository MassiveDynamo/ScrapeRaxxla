I too am intrigued by these unexpected gravitational events and have previously speculated they may have some common theme and likely a grander relevance. Maybe there are more out there?

However, be wary as I’ve mapped these locations and when compared with various other comparable correlations, these systems seem improbably distant from each other, and when viewed together, their triangulated entity is, in comparison to other groupings equally too far removed, at least from any fulcrum I’ve since studied!

Other than speculation that they might be narrative hallmarks of the Thargoid / human hybrid experiments, they remain a mystery!

Good hunting O7
