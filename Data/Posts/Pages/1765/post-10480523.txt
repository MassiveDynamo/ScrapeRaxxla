it the same concept of programming which they used in 80s. It is mathematical algorithm which generate system for you based on data. But its stored on your pc.
network is used to share your actions with ED servers.
Yes. The in-game physical universe is generated by the StellarForge algorithm which runs on every client machine. However there is also information downloaded from FD, such as first discovered tags, BGS state information, presence of hand placed assets, starports, tourist beacons, etc.
In the example I mentioned during the Formidine Rift search the fact that a system contained a Dynasty base could be detected by monitoring the network traffic download (using CTRL-B command) during the hyperspace jump sequence into that system. Also during Distant Worlds 2 expedition we built a station by mining resources, & as the supplies gradually built up FD generated different stages of station build that we could see and interact with- no client software update was needed to implement that so the station build was downloaded from the FD server.

Have you seen this thread. Alec Turner got the chance to discuss things with Dav Stott:

The early FD video by Dr Ross on the workings of the StellarForge is interesting if you haven't seen it
