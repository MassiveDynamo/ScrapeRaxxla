They would never spend time on such a thing. I do not think that Raxxla show up 1 time in a year only and only when you know where to look.
In that case, without any hints it would never been found. the chance of such an event tends to zero.

The developers gave a hint that only the most dedicated and persistent would find Raxxla which means its related to rank and reputation which means its related to hidden mission which player should trigger somehow

from a logical point of view, this is the only correct option. Especially because this planet has been found in the past and there is an organization that keeps it a secret.
Not 1 time a year.

Any planet/moon combo will have its own timing. A full moon on earth is every 30 days. A "full moon" with one of saturns moons is every 5.9 days. A "full moon" for neptune/triton is every 3.8 days. Eclipses are a little longer for earth, but an eclipse for a planet in say Delphi, happens every 10 days.

This wouldn't even take a lot of work, and is supported by the fact that only a handful of people knew where raxxla was at fdev. THe "ancient Satellites" have a nearly identical process to find them, before we got the dss changes.
