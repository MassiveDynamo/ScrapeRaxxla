If its never been found i guess that there are no secret model in game after all.
There's certainly no expectation that Raxxla has a specific distinct model for it - but then, it doesn't need one.

If, as theorised, Raxxla is the name of the planet containing some mysterious device, then the planet is just a planet and doesn't have a "model" as such. (Same with any other "Raxxla is large" theory)

If Raxxla is a smaller in-game object ... my theory is that it looks a lot like the "toast rack" at orbital stations.
- one of those on its own or maybe with some extra lights attached would look quite like some mysterious portal
- there's not an obvious reason for the stations to have suddenly gained them in Elite Dangerous when they didn't have them in previous versions
But any combination of existing model components could be hidden in the same way - there could easily be five or six subcomponents of ships and stations which if reassembled in a different combination and orientation form the "Raxxla" object model.
