Are these the same data miners that failed to discover any actual ships - including the Python 2, Type-8, Mandalay or Cobra V - in advance of their official announcements, but have been assuring us that the Panther Clipper / on-foot Thargoids / etc have been coming for years?

Because if so that's probably the strongest evidence yet that Raxxla is in the game.

Well.. we have confirmation from Drew Wagar that content plan has changed in 2017 and a lot of content does not go to the game and stay there as placeholder or legacy.
BUT with new ship relesae model which seems to me first successful marketing from ED about Elite, we would see that ships in about 1 year for sure. They would not stop on Cobra MK5 because one ship which cost 15-40 euro could give them more money than base game and Odyssey.

and tbh im ready to buy them all if we would see new paid expansions. Especially related for exploration...

remember how they done marketing on horizons release. Do you remember how they asked to buy completely separate game in Steam by 70 euro where you also buying base game for the second time
