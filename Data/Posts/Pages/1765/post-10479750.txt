I was looking at the Raxxla logo, and both the "3d cube inside a 3d cube" and the point inside a circle may suggest (at least to me) that Raxxla may be an area at the center inside a planet. Looking at how the circle in the logo is drawn, it may be a planet with an atmosphere or a gas giant. So maybe Raxxla is really a place but, being inside a planet, that place may not be accessible, and there may be other hints or signals to verify its presence at the heart of the right planet.
Or inside a star perhaps?
Perhaps a star with this symbol?


We know that that particular star has a Body ID at the centre, that we can not access. It has been there since the Gamma release and is low tech enough to have remained unchanged all this time.

At least it would fit with Miltons description in Paradise lost (opposite direction off course).
