Or, maybe that object does not exist and Dev's just joking on us. Because data mining never showed anything related to raxxla if i remember right.
Are these the same data miners that failed to discover any actual ships - including the Python 2, Type-8, Mandalay or Cobra V - in advance of their official announcements, but have been assuring us that the Panther Clipper / on-foot Thargoids / etc have been coming for years?

Because if so that's probably the strongest evidence yet that Raxxla is in the game.

What about detection by radio or visual astronomy?
Indeed - the difference in years between "first written reference to Earth's Moon" and "first person visits Earth's Moon" is even longer than the gap between Raxxla's first mention and ED's present day.
