Sometimes, I come here to read about some crazy theories. But my own ideas have lost their spark, so I just watch from the sidelines now. After thinking about it for a while, I think RAXXLA might just be a marketing gimmick. And yeah, she's probably in HIP 92360. It makes sense based on the codex, the logic, and all the evidence.Other theories are way less significant and haven't led anywhere over the years. There's never been a response from the devs or any big clues. Devs don't really care about this mystery - it's just part of the lore, making the world of the game more than just a never-ending farm. I don't think anyone on the team reads this forum. The best we can hope for is for RAXXLA to stay a mystery in the story. I don't think the game needs a final reveal for that plot point.
