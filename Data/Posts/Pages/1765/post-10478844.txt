Though on-tentacle Thargoids did seem to be a thing from an "FD-leaked pic".
Sure - they probably consider and prototype a lot more things than will ever make it into the game, because they'll turn out not to be fun, or have surprise technical difficulties, or they come up with a better idea, or whatever ... and maybe a few bits of the prototype don't get fully cleaned up and so people find them. Similarly the so-called "data miners" claimed to have found references to a "Titan"-class Thargoid at around the same time the Hydra first showed up, if not earlier; it's very unlikely that the current Titans introduced about five years later share anything but the name with it, though!

We probably will get on-foot Thargoids eventually [1] but whether they bear any resemblance to what data miners were predicting was a dead-certain part of Update 15 / 16 / 17 / 18 is another matter.

[1] Though a deliberate decision not to show them to keep them more "alien" would be an interesting and understandable one, too!
