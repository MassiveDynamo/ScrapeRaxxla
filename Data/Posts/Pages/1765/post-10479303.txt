I bet 100% of all of my money, Raxxla is Orbiting a star, planet, etc, and is only findable when whatever it is orbiting is "in line" with something else in the system.
They would never spend time on such a thing. I do not think that Raxxla show up 1 time in a year only and only when you know where to look.
In that case, without any hints it would never been found. the chance of such an event tends to zero.

The developers gave a hint that only the most dedicated and persistent would find Raxxla which means its related to rank and reputation which means its related to hidden mission which player should trigger somehow

from a logical point of view, this is the only correct option. Especially because this planet has been found in the past and there is an organization that keeps it a secret.
