Yep, and extending from the Guardian connection - one theory could be that Guardians knew about humanity in its primordial stages and left the artifact as a final hope that another species might overcome what they couldn't. Maybe Raxxla was an unfinished Guardian project and they hoped humanity could advance far enough to finish the job. Perhaps this could also explain the activity of Thargoids - if they know humans can be a Guardian-level threat courtesy of the Salvation event, then it would make sense why they seem to be preparing for something and ramping up hostility.
Mmm
Maybe Raxxla was the Guardian name for humanity??
Ah, solved it!
