This is back to the question earlier about Wolf-Rayets - it can't plausibly be the Guardian home system itself: it's a famous named star because it's bright enough to be visible as one of the brighter stars in the Sol sky from over 1000 LY away, which means it's far too large and young.

Thinking about it, if the Guardian homeworld is anywhere near it, they got really "lucky" to be able to evolve, develop technology, spread into space, and finally wipe themselves out before the impending supernova of Gamma Velorum irradiated their biosphere.


(Fortunately for humanity, the Wolf-Rayet Gliese 293 B is fictional - it'd be visible during the day otherwise!)
I've been saying this for years! Why has ED put a Wolf Rayet in LAWD26? It is a huge astronomical anomaly in a game for which DB professed accuracy. If it were true then at only 20 odd ly from Sol it would be visible during the day from Earth (in fact Earth would probably not have a night! Don't forget WR are massive stars & Regor is visible 1000+ly from Sol). Has anyone asked FD why it exists in-game??

The only reason I could come up with is that it points to the Guardian storyline since they did seem to like systems near WR stars, so is it another hint that Guardians visited/inhabited the human bubble in ancient times? (The first hint is the existence of the Alien Artefact excavated on Mars....that could have been left by Thargoids, except goid technology is biologically based and we have found no barnacles in the bubble).
