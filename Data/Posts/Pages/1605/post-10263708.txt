So Guardians didn't exactly need to live under a WR. Most guardian structures are near brown dwarfs just like the one in Gamma Velorum and, although not as often, K-type stars like the ones in Hen 2-333. We really can't tell until we look at the system.
AHA! I see what's happened! From what I know, the real Gamma Velorum doesn't have a brown dwarf in it. It's Wolf-Rayet and blue Supergiant. I hadn't considered that the ED version would be different! - my mistake!

The real Gamma Velorum is too young (by billions of years) to have any complex life evolved there - hence, simply can't be the Guardian home system. The ED version with the Brown Dwarf.... well that changes things a lot!!

"Gamma Velorum is a quadruple star system consisting of the primary component Gamma2 Velorum (Gamma Velorum A) and the secondary Gamma1 Velorum (Gamma Velorum B). Gamma2 Velorum is a spectroscopic binary star composed of a carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet star and a massive blue giant, while Gamma1 Velorum is also a spectroscopic double, consisting of a blue giant and a fainter close companion. The estimated age of the Gamma2 Velorum components is between 3.5 and 5.5 million years, while the Gamma1 Velorum stars are believed to be older, with an estimated age of 8 million years." Source.

That raises more questions. From what I can see Gamma Velorum's stellar composition should have been known before ED was made? So... Is it a bug in the stellar forge? (In which case, did they place the Guardians there based on a bug?!) or... is the difference between 'real' and 'game' a deliberate change?! ... or something else?

What's going on??
