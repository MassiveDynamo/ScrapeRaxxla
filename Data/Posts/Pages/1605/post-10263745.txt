Permits are implemented by the Pilots' Federation who control the ships' FSD. The question to ask is why are the PF banning travel into those regions, and how do they know that those regions should be permit locked?

The only thing that makes sense IMHO is that PF is controlled by a Guardian descendent, or Guardian AI, and that control has been exerted since the outset of space flight. Taken together with the Alien Artefact excavated on Mars it suggests a Guardian influence on humanity's development since pre-history.
It strikes me that Guardian technology remains are primarily monoliths, which to me implies that 2001 Space Odyssey may have influenced more than just the ED docking music.
