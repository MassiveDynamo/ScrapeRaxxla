Seeing as the Mars relic was small enough to fit in a human’s hand then it’s obviously: portable; convenient; easy to hold or compact. This may be intended or by accident (broken pieces).

The relic is by Brookes admission from the Dev diaries a narrative construct. At that point in time objects could not be smaller than a cargo pod.

But what fits into a cargo pod….
