I would also really like to know if anyone has asked Fdev why it's there, is it a bug, or something more? I can't believe no-one has asked?



No, the star Gliese 293 is a White Dwarf star, which is the A component of the system in ED. Source 1, Source 2. We're talking about the hecking massive Wolf-Rayet star that's the B component in the system, which absolutely doesn't exist IRL.
I was surprised as well, and I put this question to Support this morning. They are gonna ask the dev team next week, so I'll let y'all know.
