Trinkets of Hidden Fortune, perhaps? Also, LHS 3447 (one of the start systems) has a rare good - Galactic Travel Guide. There is the Mysterious Idol, tok. Though, generally I consider anything requiring actual effort to obtain is likely to more valuable. The Revised Catholic Mission for all practical purposes runs the Federation (based out of Aymiay, Beta Hydri, and Mars). Assume that is somehow important. If we secretly made peace with a group of the aliens, the Federation and Alliance are high up on the list of groups that may have more of an idea of what transpired.
