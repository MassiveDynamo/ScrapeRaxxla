As far as "stars mysteriously close to Earth" go, it's probably just a stellar forge anomaly from the need to compromise between "accurate" and "fast".

Duamta (F-class at 9.88 LY) is another example that's been spotted a few times over the years, and Yin Sector CL-Y d127 (9.86 LY) is even more obviously fictional.
