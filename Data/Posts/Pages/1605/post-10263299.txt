ve been saying this for years! Why has ED put a Wolf Rayet in LAWD26? It is a huge astronomical anomaly in a game for which DB professed accuracy. If it were true then at only 20 odd ly from Sol it would be visible during the day from Earth (in fact Earth would probably not have a night! Don't forget WR are massive stars & Regor is visible 1000+ly from Sol). Has anyone asked FD why it exists in-game??
Because maybe it's a real star.

We already covered that and why Earth's sky aren't bright as day all the time...
The Quest To Find Raxxla
Good question, AFAIK it was giving us the hint that led to the newer sites? The galnet article that accompanied it said: The placement of the Cete is very interesting IMO, it seems to suggest that either it jumped through the Regor sector, or around it, but I'm not sure why: I've made this...
