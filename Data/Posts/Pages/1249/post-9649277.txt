My only response here is the reference should be Tau Ceti and not Sol. The journal appears in Tau Ceti. Also, Tau Ceti wasn't exactly on good terms with Sol at the time until the treaty giving Beta Hydri back to the entity predating the Federation (same treaty left off Black Mausoleum station out of the treaty brokered by Sirius Corporation - the Imperial station in a Federation Founder system). The Federation Accords formally founding the current Federation were signed immediately afterwards. That happened approximately in 3250. Also, the Federation in it's existing form is only older than the Empire if you allow for it's various names and variants of the Constitution to be the same thing. On a purely technical point, the Empire in its' current form predates the Federation by at least 150-200 or so years.

First generation ship launched in 2097 (the Mayflower 97). Raxxla is known by name in 2296.

200 years at sublight speed. With acceleration and deceleration they were unlikely to travel more than 0.5 light speed on average. Probably far less.
Then the generation ship travelers would need to communicate back to Sol / Tau Ceti, with ftl communication. This was not invented, when they left.

If they flew back and told the story, Raxxla has to be very close to Sol.
