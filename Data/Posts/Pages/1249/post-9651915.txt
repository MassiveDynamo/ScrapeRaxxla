Ok - I had my stepson visit for Sunday lunch yesterday and he asked if I remembered if I had the grabs of Raxxla a while ago when he was using my account. I don’t remember it or knew w he was talking about at the time. Now .. as it was my account I‘m going to see if I can find it. I assume horizons and odyssey data are both merged in the games.

I don’t follow or read any lore so I’m not even sure what it’s about but I’ve seen the planet name whatever mentioned many times.

he said it was a very dark purple star with a planet that wasn’t marked as ’undiscovered’ but actually had the name straight away. It was 450,000 odd [Edit:] Light seconds [i think he meant] away and took him a while to get there.

i will look tomorrow and see if there is any evidence of this or that he was mistaken.
