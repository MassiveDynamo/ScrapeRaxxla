Question/Help/Found Somthing....

HIP 17482 2 A

EDSM - Elite Dangerous Star Map
The Galactic Positioning System of Elite: Dangerous at your service.
www.edsm.net

Is listed as a landfall planet on EDSM.
But is in fact, not a landfall planet (atleast on xbox, with Horizons amd Odyssey compatible update)
It has a planetary boundary and cannot approach the surface at all.

A place that isn't a place?

Anyone have any information on this, and why it might be this way if its not a part of Raxxla? And if it is, then WHOA MOMMA, lol

Edit/Update;
Never mind me... didn't realize Odyssey had added more atmospheric landings that are not available to Horizons/Console players as the Odyssey update hasn't been given to us....
Oops, and darn...

It is kinda strange though, to have the new Multi Limpit controllers and a bunch of the Odyssey stuff, in console, but not have access to normal Horizons style landings on these new worlds...

Anyways
