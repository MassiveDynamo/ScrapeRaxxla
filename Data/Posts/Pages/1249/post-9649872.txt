First generation ship launched in 2097 (the Mayflower 97). Raxxla is known by name in 2296.

200 years at sublight speed. With acceleration and deceleration they were unlikely to travel more than 0.5 light speed on average. Probably far less.
Then the generation ship travelers would need to communicate back to Sol / Tau Ceti, with ftl communication. This was not invented, when they left.

If they flew back and told the story, Raxxla has to be very close to Sol.
This (plus the Mars artefact indicating aliens had visited Sol) was my original reason for concentrating my search around Sol. Yet the rumour date of 2296 allows for a potential find date of up to around 2290 (assuming a secretive organisation finds it, but with some leakage due to human nature/hostile intelligence efforts, etc). Lack of supporting evidence for a report/gossip in pilots’ bars suggesting “something” odd had possibly been found “somewhere” would cause a rumour to arise in a short time. The Republic of Achenar (139.5 ly from Sol) was founded in 2292, suggesting that was the edge of the bubble at that time.
So I think Raxxla may be anywhere within a bubble centred on Sol (or Tau Ceti if you wish) out to ~150 ly radius

And possibly much further if unmanned probes and manned deep space exploration are taken into account.
