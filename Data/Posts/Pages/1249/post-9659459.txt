weird!
Flew for 30 minutes just before lunch, then a visitor so logged out to desktop. Now loader is giving me "error 403 client out of date", even though I spent an hour Tuesday updating both EDO and Horizons, and there is no update option shown.

edit. Looks like another update today. Rebooted PC, opened launcher, still not getting an update game option!
Launcher "Server Status" still shows OK & green!! Methinks it is fibbing!!
