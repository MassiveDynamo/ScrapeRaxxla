It's very simple - the United States was convinced that they had won the war of 2055, but in fact, the cunning Russians, with the help of hackers, leaked into the government and reformed the United States from the inside, turning it into an appendage of the Federation. They put Hudson-Biden on the post of president so that everyone could see - that's a real American! The Empire is just Russian oligarchs and runaway officials who stole from the Federation, having founded the monarchical system
