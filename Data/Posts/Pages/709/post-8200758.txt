In Greek mythology, Autolycus (/ɔːˈtɒlɪkəs/; Ancient Greek: Αὐτόλυκος Autolykos, "the wolf of the west") was a successful robber who had even the power of metamorphosing both the stolen goods and himself. He had his residence on Mount Parnassus and was renowned among men for his cunning and oaths.

Mount Parnassus is where the Omphalos / temple of Delphi resides. I wonder where the winking cat lives?

Yes and which system suffers from Omphalos Syndrome more than any other system in the galaxy? Prism.
