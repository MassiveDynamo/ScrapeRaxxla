Just to add on to the duality thing. I already went over the Music Festival at Phekda but my initial assessment was probably flawed.

The Jade Graceland and Topaz Philharmonic seem to allude to Prism and Soontill.

The Spectacular Nemesis, The Lasting Hold, and Xiona. Seem to hint at Persephone, Lucifer and Raxxla.

I also would like to mention that Neptune aka Poseidon was part of the reason Odysseus went on his Odessey in the first place. Again, Prism has many references to Autolycus and Odesseus. Particularly Eurycleia, the only person that recognized Odesseus while he was in disguise.
