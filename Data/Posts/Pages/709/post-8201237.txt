Okay so upon further consideration I've pondered, perhaps this is why the mysterious tip missions and job offers will populate after being in a system for so long. someone potentially investigating for secrets or something hidden will probably be in a system for a hot minute while they're doing their investigations. Perhaps if you're in the right system or a key system you'll get the right mysterious tip or job offer.
