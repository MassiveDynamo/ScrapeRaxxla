At the risk of dredging up a long buried section of this thread for not much gain, I just want to seek the collective wisdom on the latest 'Job Offer' messages and any relevance to rankings with PF in my quest for TDW/TRDW.

I decided on a whim to re-visit the SD beacons on the PF / Elite and was scanning the Pilots Federation Near Monopoly when I received a Job Offer invitation.

Has anyone else ran into this in Shinrarta Dezhra specifically?


I should clarify I'm only double Elite (still climbing in Combat), and am fully Allied with the DW but no one else in SD.

I accepted the Job Offer and promptly attended to the target location. To say that it didn't quite goes as planned would be an understatement.

In my previous experience, a Convoy Threat 3 doesn't normally have 3x Navy Engineered Navy Cutters, and 8x Escorts of Eagles / Vultures / Cobra M3. However I valiantly attempted to perform the requisite task using my Engineered Vette + Elite Pilot and failed miserably! I lost 4 fighters, used 4 SCB before I'd managed to kill one Cutter then had modules damaged so lost the fighter bay and quickly realised I needed to adjust my module allocation for this one.

So I'm currently paying off the Wanted bounty, and re-fitting for another try in a nearby Alliance system.

SPOILER: WHO TIPPED OFF MY TARGET, AND INTERESTING ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONVOY - XENO HUNTING?








Even if this isn't related specifically to TDW or RAXXLA I'm enjoying the challenge and it's got a bit of unknown about it, so well played FDEV.
