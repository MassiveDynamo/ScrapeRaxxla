Also “Princess Astrophel and the Spiral of Stars” has a duality to it. Is Princess Astrophel an allusion to Lucifer (The fallen star). And the Spiral of Stars an allusion to Soontill. I’m beginning to think so. The Club have been seemingly playing chess with humanity but playing against “who” exactly?
Everything has duality, or they wouldn't stay in motion. As mentioned, Lucifer the light bringer could be the planet Venus, aka the morning (mourning) star when leading the Sun, while she could also be considered as fallen when trailing the Sun. From our perspective, she is on the right or left hand of the "SUN of GOD".

Nikola Tesla said to understand the Universe, one must think in terms of frequency and vibration, and if all the heavenly objects emit their own unique 'tone' eg the 7.83Hz Schumann cavity resonance of Earth then what is likely to happen when those emissions collide, merge, cancel each other or form standing waves?

The origins of chess are tricky to nail down however, the starting positions of the pieces are interesting as the Queen (Luna - Cancer) stands to the left of the King (Sol - Leo) flanked by the two bishops (Mercury - Gemini and Virgo) then two knights (Venus - Taurus and Libra) and two rooks (Mars - Aries and Scorpio).

Pawns on black squares are ruled by Saturn, the black cube and the white Jupiter. As above, so below.
