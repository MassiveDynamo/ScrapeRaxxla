I got the impression that Oberon and Neptune had parted ways because of their split decisions between Raxxla and Soontill. This is suggested as to where the CIEP got its origin.

I'm not disagreeing with any of this just trying to clarify from what I believe to be true
I honestly don’t remember. It’s been a very long time since I read and here the wheel. The main thing I’m drawing from their names is their choices on which mystery to go after. The possibility that Alex Ryder named them Neptune and Oberon with a purpose.

Oberon in myth was a wily trickster similar perhaps to Autolycus and Odesseus, Neptune aka Poseidon a deity who’s enmity you wanted to avoid if you wanted a fair voyage.
