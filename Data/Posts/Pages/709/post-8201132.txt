Well I learnt something new today! Don't go to lunch IRL or a in-game Job Offer you've accepted (and attempted) will 'Fail'. Damnit.

On a positive note, I did identify that the Job Offer was originally from 'Future of Arro Naga' who I was allied with, and subsequently have dropped to Friendly.

They also appear to be an ally of TDW as they are on the target list of TDW's Operation Less Than Three's allies that offer the Founders/Elite missions I've been investigating extensively.

I'll keep an eye out for other opportunities, and missions - my ship is now equipped to handle more punishment.

Fly Dangerously.

Sounds like a tough version of one the standard missions, so might be the TRDW test. The phrasing of the message is reminiscent of the old UA military convoy missions, they didnâ€™t know what they were carrying either (though some of them seemed to be carrying either goids or ravening soldier clones who went amok). You probably need to re-ally with the mission giver to stand a chance of getting it again. Might be worth trying this in a wing?
