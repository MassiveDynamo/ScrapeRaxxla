I honestly don’t remember. It’s been a very long time since I read and here the wheel. The main thing I’m drawing from their names is their choices on which mystery to go after. The possibility that Alex Ryder named them Neptune and Oberon with a purpose.

Oberon in myth was a wily trickster similar perhaps to Autolycus and Odesseus, Neptune aka Poseidon a deity who’s enmity you wanted to avoid if you wanted a fair voyage.
Oberon was the one who branched off and formed the CIEP and found/held Soontil. Neptune continued his search for Raxxla, if that helps.
