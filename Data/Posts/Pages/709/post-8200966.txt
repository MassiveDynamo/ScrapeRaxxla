I accepted the Job Offer and promptly attended to the target location. To say that it didn't quite goes as planned would be an understatement.

In my previous experience, a Convoy Threat 3 doesn't normally have 3x Navy Engineered Navy Cutters, and 8x Escorts of Eagles / Vultures / Cobra M3. However I valiantly attempted to perform the requisite task using my Engineered Vette + Elite Pilot and failed miserably! I lost 4 fighters, used 4 SCB before I'd managed to kill one Cutter then had modules damaged so lost the fighter bay and quickly realised I needed to adjust my module allocation for this one.

So I'm currently paying off the Wanted bounty, and re-fitting for another try in a nearby Alliance system.









Even if this isn't related specifically to TDW or RAXXLA I'm enjoying the challenge and it's got a bit of unknown about it, so well played FDEV.

Well I learnt something new today! Don't go to lunch IRL or a in-game Job Offer you've accepted (and attempted) will 'Fail'. Damnit.

On a positive note, I did identify that the Job Offer was originally from 'Future of Arro Naga' who I was allied with, and subsequently have dropped to Friendly.

They also appear to be an ally of TDW as they are on the target list of TDW's Operation Less Than Three's allies that offer the Founders/Elite missions I've been investigating extensively.

I'll keep an eye out for other opportunities, and missions - my ship is now equipped to handle more punishment.

Fly Dangerously.
