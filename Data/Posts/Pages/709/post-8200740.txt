Another trend I’ve noticed: Mechanics.
Art Tornqvist a mechanic related to Cora (another Persephone hint).

Gan Romero another mechanic called out to the void.

The Demeter Generation Ship. Two factions formed on it. The Mechanics and an opposing (more naturally inclined) faction. The Mechanics worshipped the Engine as if it was a deity.

This may be a leap but are these Mechanics being reached out to by Raxxla or Lucifer to help release it or something? Because it’s bound by those coils? Idk a stretch to say the least.
