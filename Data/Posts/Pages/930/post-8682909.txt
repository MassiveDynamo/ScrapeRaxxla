Oh I'm pretty sure what that one is.... and yes mythology... more than happy to share if you're interested

On the “To the whisperer in witch-space, the siren of the deepest void!” - I think it's the knowledgeable version too, but possibly Thargoids as they can pull you out of witch-space so obviously more knowledgeable than humans.

I also think Sirius is in there but for another reason...

Oh definitely! Please share!
