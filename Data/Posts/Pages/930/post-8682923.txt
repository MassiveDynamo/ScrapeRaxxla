The lover's woe
Dictionary definition of “woe”: noun, big problems or troubles:

“The country has been beset by economic woes for the past decade.”
“Unusually poor harvests have added to the country's woes.”

If Odysseus is the subject of this part of the toast then Penelope would be the lover; with respect to her problems (in addition to her husband’s non-return) it would point to the problem of the suitors and her attempts to avoiding marriage whilst the great wealth of Odysseus is being consumed. Further to this the suitors plotted to kill Odysseus should he return and also his son Telemachus on his return from searching for his father during his trip to Pylos and Sparta which Penelope feared and discusses with Eurymachus.
