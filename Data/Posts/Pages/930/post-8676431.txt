Can confirm I didnt find it in the most obviously named system 'HIP 1984' worth a try though.

However, on the way went though Struve's Lost Sector / Nebula, that one grabbed my attention I can tell you. Reading about it bears some similarities to some versions or guesses at Raxxla, not sure its ever been scientifically explained or whether it was just bad astronomy in the 1st place. But Lost Sector, Im on the way back there for a look around....I was intending to be back in the bubble 4 weeks ago but keep getting distracted.

Edit: Link may help

Struve's Lost Nebula
Struve's Lost Nebula was nebulosity reported by Otto Wilhelm Struve in 1868, and verified by Heinrich d'Arrest, in the vicinity of Hind's Variable Nebula.
