Yeah it refers to an old fan base in Eastern Europe, I thought it was Russian but they say Finland magazine so maybe wider.

They wrote some stories, fan fiction, on message boards or that made it into magazines or fanzines and got confused with canonical lore, bits of it all over this thread for one.

The last bit (The P.S. and some later posts) about a version of Raxxla being in some games I dont have enough info about. Ive heard that it was all purely fan fiction / hoax that they 'found' Raxxla in game but Ive also heard that they hacked the game and wrote it in for the purpose of the story / hoax and even that a version with the hack was widely shared in certain fan circles and therefore played by a lot of people who then repeated it as fact either knowing it to be a hacked version with a hacker placed Raxxla or unknowingly believing it was an original version and it was in there. (Eastern Europe / Russia / Finland?) I dont know how much if any of this paragraph is true, I havent seen the original magazines or message boards where it happened and even then would need translating. I havent seen any evidence or screenshots or anything from anyone who posted it originally, all I have is verbal anecdotes and long lost tales and 'I heard this...'.

Eastern Europe is only significant because at the time we had The Cold War and relations and communications between East & West were very limited, meaning especially in USSR and satellites fans could be self-contained in their own groups and develop their own lore within it and maybe without access to outside 'proper' lore depending on censorship. So a lot of the info came out afterwards and is not from source.

Either way its all just fan fiction, we know Raxxla hasnt been in any published authorised versions of the game. It wasnt even mentioned in E2 & E3 iirc, not even in lore.
