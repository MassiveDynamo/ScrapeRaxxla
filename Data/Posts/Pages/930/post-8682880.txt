It’s the third line that I can’t solve! Not getting anywhere with interpretations via mythology. My previous Paradise Lost hypothesis (search this thread) suggested Alpha Centauri’s Eden.The “parent’s grief” is singular (only one parent), but FD are noted for frequently poor grammar so not a strong piece of evidence, however my Paradise Lost hypothesis fitted all three lines beautifully, but I didn’t find any trace of a stealth station at Eden (may only be instanced once you have the invitation) or Raxxla. sigh.

Oh I'm pretty sure what that one is.... and yes mythology... more than happy to share if you're interested

On the “To the whisperer in witch-space, the siren of the deepest void!” - I think it's the knowledgeable version too, but possibly Thargoids as they can pull you out of witch-space so obviously more knowledgeable than humans.

I also think Sirius is in there but for another reason...
