I may have been abducted,
and taken to some dimly lit station for interrogation,
and some enthusiastic re-education,
by a group of clandestine individuals,
about some dim memory I have of Operation Less Than Three...

However I escaped in a suicide-winder left hot in the dock, I've used every ounce of mental resource I possessed and I refused to succumb to their veiled threats and innuendos and after a long stint in recovery (and lots of Lavian Brandy) I'm back in the black cmdrs.

Unfortunately, I still can't find that damn startport, nor have they 'invited' me for a more civilized chat.

I live in hope!
