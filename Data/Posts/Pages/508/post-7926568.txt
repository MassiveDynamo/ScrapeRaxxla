If in game, rogue planets should appear in the GalMap (should they ?) as faint and apparently uninteresting as brown dwarfs. I am not sure the Dark Worlds have beed explored so thoroughly as others systems. Long treks among non-scoopable stars may be a good mean of obfuscation.
And, again, Jason Ryder needed to prepare an expedition to Raxxla. Why ? Extra fuel tanks ?
This is brilliant. Deep in a bunch of non-scoopable stars. Only problem is once you get there are you getting back out?
