This is brilliant. Deep in a bunch of non-scoopable stars. Only problem is once you get there are you getting back out?

Right.. Maybe the only way back would then to have a refuel kindly offered by TDW... Or they have a convenient NS in/next to their dark system..
We could look for NS hidden among Dark Regions. They may have been put there for a reason.
Late EDIT: ... by TDW or by any twisted men residing on that body, of course. Besides, if it is Raxxla, jumping back wherever you want shouldn't be a problem...
