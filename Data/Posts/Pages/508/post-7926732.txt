I did encounter a Dark Wheel npc at one of the SD moons, can’t remember which. It showed interest in any cargo I might be carrying (wasn’t), then it just bumbled around as they usually do until I lost interest and waked away.

SD is the obvious place for TDW station (need to be elite to get the permit, though the npcs often aren’t-odd!), but it might need a bit of searching; I’ve not seen any signs of it. Beginning to think it might not be orbiting an 8th moon! Started to look at other moons also when out exploring. If the Horizons start screen is a clue, then it’s by two close icy moons.
I don't think the means to be invited to join TDW is in SD. This is because of the in-game description of how to get a permit.

"Achieving a high rank with the Pilots' Federation is the most common way to earn such an invitation, but other, more secretive methods are also known to exist. "

This implies, you can get an invite from TDW, without even being Elite, let alone going to SD. I'll say it again...."Perhaps by finding Raxxla!"

Especially given that TDW are a "clique" of the PF, apparently????
