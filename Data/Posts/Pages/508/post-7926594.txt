Didn’t! Did notice a new contact was repeatedly reported as soon as I went into SC, but couldn’t locate it & suspect it was a wake contact several kls away.
Do you think that a TDW ship low waking to its hidden station could look somewhat like that contact? I mean, that station that avoids detection must have some kind of detectable traffic.
Could be a point in shadowing ships that are low-waking in apparently uninteresting spots around 8th moons. They don't have to be registered as TDW or whatever.
Besides, it was a (happy) time when FDevs were used to fly "floating NPCs for lore purposes"... An Elyssia Fields', or so, ship orbiting and low waking any 8th moon would be like touching heaven, imho...
Or am I too enthusiast, FD ?
