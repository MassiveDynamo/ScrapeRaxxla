If in game, rogue planets should appear in the GalMap (should they ?) as faint and apparently uninteresting as brown dwarfs. I am not sure the Dark Worlds have beed explored so thoroughly as others systems. Long treks among non-scoopable stars may be a good mean of obfuscation.
And, again, Jason Ryder needed to prepare an expedition to Raxxla. Why ? Extra fuel tanks ?
Hmm, not sure we can quite say that. According to Rafe Zetter, Jason had found evidence for the real existence of Raxxla. That doesn’t necessarily mean he’d found anything to provide the location. Rafe also says that Jason had come back to get a proper team together, but doesn’t specify the nature of that team. It could be an assault team, a science team, an archaeological team, etc, etc. As is the norm we just don’t know.

That’s from the end of the Novella. Pretty sure there isn’t anything that goes into more specifics anywhere else in there. Haven’t checked exhaustively though, so could be wrong!

Edit - removed a load of stuff which was basically starting thoughts on how to best reply to a completely different post, but accidentally posted along with this one, even though I thought they’d been deleted. Sorry about that!
