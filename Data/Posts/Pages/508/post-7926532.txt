You're right. I just got bummed when I got there and there's a station just chilling, seemingly not hiding anything (like all of them).

Someone paraphrased a statement from, I think, someone at fdev saying I t could be anything and included things like an asteroid or an object or generation ship.

while I was disappointedly looking at the system map for beta pictoris, I noticed it had a little asteroid belt. It made me wonder how many times do we see an asteroid belt in a system and don't think anything of it. meanwhile, little raxxlaan clues could be in one of them somewhere, almost impossible to find.
