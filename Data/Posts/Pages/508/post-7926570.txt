Btw, did anyone perform a serious survey of SD 8th moons orbits ? Or shall I consider to rearm my trusty AspX with Mark I Eyeball Sensors ?

Jorki was in SD recently & hopped over to the 8th moons. Dropped out of SC several times around them trying to see anything stealthy. Didn’t! Did notice a new contact was repeatedly reported as soon as I went into SC, but couldn’t locate it & suspect it was a wake contact several kls away. If you want to check my position was AB3g 0.15ls, AB3f 19.4ls, AB3h 39.8ls.

Seem to remember reporting about a year ago a wider gap between two SD moons than I expected, but can’t find that post (darn new forum, darn FD tidying, darn!).

@filthymick. Rogue bodies might be reported in the system map, but then again they may not. Depends how FD have set it up. Since a rogue body is not really part of the system then I think it may not. It would (presumably) be detectable like the comets are (there was a thread on that topic) - watch out for “slow down” message when you’re not expecting it & drop out of SC?
