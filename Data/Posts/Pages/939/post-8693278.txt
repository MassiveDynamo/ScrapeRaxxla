I think the date is relevant because of the Mars relic, that was found in the 2280s.
I suspect it contains some sort of info about Raxxla and leaked info lead to the start of the myth.

Also possible, though if the relic is Guardian (as seems to me to be hinted at by Ram Tah’s decodes about Guardian hunting parties and seeding planets) then Raxxla could be anywhere, given the extent of Guardian travel with sites out past Col70 & also towards Colonia etc.

Wasn’t there a monolith found on some planet back in the early days??
ah yes, Location: Altais 2 B, Coordinates: 46.9085° 1.8115°; may have been a bug now fixed. Never visited it to see.
