I can’t find a system that corresponds to “lover’s woe” in the toast. Have downloaded a copy of the Odyssey and searching that for “woe” comes up with both Penelope and Odysseus since they’re missing each other, but there are no such systems in-game. Nor is the greek name “Proci” for the suitors of Penelope who would be obvious cause for woe.

Penelope is suggested as Alcyone in the book I am reading.... went and had a look and lovely system.... only 72 Thargoid signals detected.... see my vid further up... LOL...

Popped in to a few of them in my DBX and they weren't happy with me....but nothing unusual.... Guardian FSD booster I imagine! ;-)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/201_Penelope is the only real world reference I can find....
