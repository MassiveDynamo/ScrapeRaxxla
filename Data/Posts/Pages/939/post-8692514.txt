Indeed there's not much love for the Blue Crew, however I see the same pattern in other systems for adjacent system factions so I guess it's normal.
Thanks Macros.

Do you mean a targeted hatred for a specific opposing faction from a nearby system? I've seen that too, so not holding out much for allying up with NBC but thought since they're diametrically opposed to TDW it may lead to something else interesting.

My personal journey anyway! And about all I've got time for at the moment.
