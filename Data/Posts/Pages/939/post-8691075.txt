Penelope is suggested as Alcyone in the book I am reading.... went and had a look and lovely system.... only 72 Thargoid signals detected.... see my vid further up... LOL...

Popped in to a few of them in my DBX and they weren't happy with me....but nothing unusual.... Guardian FSD booster I imagine! ;-)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/201_Penelope is the only real world reference I can find....
At least there is a (no longer used) constellation named Antinous, which is part of Aquila(also the eagle of Zeus). But the Parent's grief doesn't match into this.
