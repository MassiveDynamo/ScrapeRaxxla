Interesting, how did you get it? Scanning a USS?
Condition Zulu is a new one to me. Any indication from the state of the system what that could be? Have you tried jumping into one of the unavailable permitted systems with it? Ah re-read it, looks like might be to access an installation...installations in Nuenets?
As just posted I retrieved this from an installation, but couldn't see how I could utilise it. Mind you I only had 5 minutes before I had to log off, so thought I'd check possible community options before logging in later to see where I might focus my efforts. But if nothing is highlighted, I'll try some random stuff against the installations to see what happens.
