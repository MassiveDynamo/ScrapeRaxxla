Good points, as always! Though I disagree on the date. I think it’s relevant, otherwise why put it in. I think FD was saying it’s quite close to/within the bubble, and I think that applies to both Raxxla and TDW station.
(But I could be wrong )

I’m currently wondering if the Raxxla logo is actually a diagram of the Omphalos “gateway”.

I suppose it’s possible that parent’s grief & lover’s woe are poetic references to the sufferers of the woe & grief, rather than the causes/symptoms, to make the toast flow better, but if so I don’t like it! It would be very bad English grammar!!!
