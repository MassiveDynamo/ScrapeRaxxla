Pretty frequently for sure. I'm guessing you got it from either a data point on a surface or a satellite at an installation, is that correct?

Yes, I got it from one of the installations in Nuenets. I'm not logged in at the moment, but it wasn't 'Old Pool View', the other one. Hadn't seen it before, and usually don't get any messages in my inbox, just notification of the other points to scan/attack etc.
