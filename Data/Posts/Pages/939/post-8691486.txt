Has anyone else encountered an Inbox message like this before?
Specialised Legacy Firmware
Firmware version 0.7.02
[Firmware installation access key]
[Firmware version 0.7.02 installation package]
Warning: This is an experimental firmware update for condition Zulu environments only!


I normally associate Specialised Legacy Firmware with material gathering, I don't recall ever seeing this personally in my inbox before. Not even when performing SRV scans et al.

I encountered this in Nuenets.

Pretty frequently for sure. I'm guessing you got it from either a data point on a surface or a satellite at an installation, is that correct?
