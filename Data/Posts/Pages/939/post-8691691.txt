The recent DW bgs stuff has got me thinking about the factions around lft 509. Lft 509 is marked as federal democracy. Almost all the federal factions nearby are federal confedercies. Perhaps bring these fed democracies to power will trigger something. If nothing else pushing wars in a small bubble of systems will make getting mcv spawns easier. The games does try to draw attention to war and civil wars systems/factions with the spawning of mcvs. ( which carry sap 8 core containers.)

Previously it seems the focus was on independent factions only and fed factions were ignored.
