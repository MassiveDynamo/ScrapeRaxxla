Good points, as always! Though I disagree on the date. I think it’s relevant, otherwise why put it in. I think FD was saying it’s quite close to/within the bubble, and I think that applies to both Raxxla and TDW station.
(But I could be wrong )

I’m currently wondering if the Raxxla logo is actually a diagram of the Omphalos “gateway”.
I think the date is relevant because of the Mars relic, that was found in the 2280s.
I suspect it contains some sort of info about Raxxla and leaked info lead to the start of the myth.
