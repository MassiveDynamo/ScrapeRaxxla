Cool. Another loose end tied up for my concern

just because a character says something is so ... it doesn't necessarily mean that they are correct. Characters have limited knowledge or may even be deliberately lying about the knowledge they do have. When the author presents a fact in the narrative we should accept that fact at face value but when the author delivers a fact through the voice of one of his characters we have to consider the possibility that the character might not be 100% correct ...

Except, imho, the 'good' Luko. Speaks little, speaks true. I miss this character so much ...
