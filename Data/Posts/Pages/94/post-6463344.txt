‘I’ve seen you run missions out of Shinrarta Dezhra,’ Thorn replied.
‘Shinrarta Dezhra?’ The woman laughed, her scorn plain to hear. ‘You think the Dark Wheel advertises on a station board in plain sight? That we need rookie pilots to drag a couple of tonnes of thrumpberry flavouring across to Hutton orbital? A trivial ploy to keep the founders amused.‘It keeps the treasure seekers and wishful thinkers occupied,(AKA the Rifters, Note to the Editor) the woman said.‘They believe they are on to something. They have their uses for occasional menial activities. The truth is far more subtle than they will ever suspect.Shinrarta is nothing.’You should not consider the Dark Wheel a single organisation, gentlemen. How could it survive for so long if it were so? The Wheel has many levels, many hubs, cogs, gears and spokes. It is more akin to an affiliation of organisations that share certain common goals. Interlocking in purpose.
Consider yourselves now spinning on the outermost rim.’

By the way, Doc, may be you can confirm Alessia Verdi is also known as Drew Waggar ?
