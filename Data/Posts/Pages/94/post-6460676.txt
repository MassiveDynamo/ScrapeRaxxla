Had a bit of a tinfoil thought last night as I was working on my ship. Generally I’ve been looking at Greek/Roman mythology for clues, mainly because of the naming of the planets in Salomé’s home system that tells her life story via those mythologies. BUT, Salomé and her ship have their namesakes in Biblical mythologies. Which makes me think that Salomé was actually not really what she claimed. Salomé tricked and seduced people to do things they shouldn’t do in these stories. So what if Salomé is the bad (thargoids etc. talking about making shipments with the darkwheel with containers that it’s not important that you know what’s inside sounds a lot like the Thargoid baby deliveries in the dark wheel novella.) and Raxxla is the opposite. The answer to the problem. So in biblical mythology what is the door and the key? A place that isn’t a place, a portal to other worlds? Well, in the NT Jesus holds the keys and is the way (door) to the heaven (other worlds. A place that isn’t a ‘place’?) what astronomical event is tied to the person of Jesus? The star of Bethlehem. Which is generally believed to have been Halley’s Comet. So, is Halley’s Comet in game? The voyager satellites are so maybe. Where would Halley’s Comet be in 3304?
