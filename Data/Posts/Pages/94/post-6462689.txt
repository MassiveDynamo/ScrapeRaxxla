Facts:
The TDW faction is not TDW

That is not a fact. That is a speculation. Yes ... I know what Drew wrote in Premonition but when I asked him directly about this his answer was:

You have to remember that the Dark Wheel are the masters of obfuscation. Misdirection and confusion are definitely their modus operandi. Having people question whether they even exist suits their purposes extremely well. The Dark Wheel faction at Shinrarta Dezhra may be official, or it may not be. You need to ask yourselves whether or not it would suit the purposes of the Dark Wheel to have such an outlet and if they did, to what use would they put it?

Cheers,

Drew.
