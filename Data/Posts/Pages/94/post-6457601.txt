The Vain Queen rides not forth/She rides a Giraffe!

I just got done poking through Tionisla, checking on the Graveyards status post 3.0 (Its still not there) when i saw the tourist beacon about the Partly Decoded Curious Transmission again. "The Vain Queen rides a giraffe that remembers her Daughter's hero".

Now i'm most DEFIANTLY not the first CMDR to look at this and note the Beacon's location (where the famous Orbital Graveyard should be) and think "this might be the start of something, possibly related to Raxxla". BUT i started digging nontheless. I remembered this Galnet article: https://community.elitedangerous.com/en/galnet/uid/58ef455321863e482879779d.

"The vain queen rides not forth". The Queen again.

(Summarizing for time) The Riddle eventually led to the "official" discovery of the Zurura out in the Formidine rift. A pretty major discovery, lore wise, but not too big. Salome was connected to it via the woman who came back from it with memory loss. Salome is/was believed to be connected to the Dark Wheel. To summarize a bit of research:
The Queen is Cassiopeia (of Greek myth, and real life constellation), her daughter is Andromeda and HER hero is Perseus.

Cassiopeia's brightest star is Alpha Cassiopeiae, also known as Schedar. I'm at Schedar now not really expecting to find anything, but might be a thread to follow out here. One of the Dev's (forget who) in a livestream was asked about Raxxla, and while reconfirming the "no Clues" rhetoric, he said (paraphrasing due to memory) its in the milky way", and "You have to make some of it a little, tiny bit obvious so that people know what their doing".

I'm logging off now for sleep. Will continue on tomorrow when i can, but i think this is something already tried and i just don't know about it. If anyone else thinks there could be anything to this piece they can try themselves in the meantime.
