Yep, this.

I think what might potentially cause some of the confusion is the meaning of ‘lore’.

There’s lore in the sense of full GM level lore, which is only known to probably just a few people at FD.

Then there’s lore in the sense of info that comes to us as players. That sense of ‘lore’ is obviously the one that’s the relevant one in this context, but if a different interpretation of lore is used then it’s going to end up with things getting muddled.

What is wrong with if it provably in the game - run with it. How is this hard? This is why I investigate any suspected story arcs. Salomé said the old lore/stories were important.
