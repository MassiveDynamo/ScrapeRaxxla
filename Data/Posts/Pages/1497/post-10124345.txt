I think the key to this all is to realise that what you want (in terms of a consensus on what’s lore and what’s not) is in antithesis to the principles of the game.
Consensus doesn't prove anything. Either it there after an investigation or it isn't. Anyone who pays attention to the lore would have to be quite comfortable with being confident in their abilities to investigate even if the majority disagrees. This is not a popularity contest. Either you can find evidence and keep going or you reformulate ideas. To my knowledge, the only statement from Frontier Developments on Raxxla is "there will be no hints". Also these few key statements:

Confirmed Information

⬣ Raxxla does exist: <

David Braben: "What a silly question, of course!"
He didn't say "You don't know what it is" as an answer to the question, he said it to the guy sitting next to him. However, we don't know what it is since we haven't found it yet.

⬣ Raxxla is in the Milky Way: <

Michael Brookes: "It's in the Milky Way, but I can't tell you where at this stage. It's a journey that everyone has to travel for themselves."
There will be no clues, "but I think you'd have to make some of it a tiny little bit obvious so people know what they're doing."

⬣ FDev doesn't share information on Raxxla with writers, including Drew Wagar:

"The subject of alien races came up and, as a writer, he reminded me of an 'Alien background doc' given to the writers as research material. I do have this, but I'm not allowed (due to NDA) to publish it. Raxxla is part of that. None of the writers were allowed to explore Raxxla, it was very much reserved for 'in-house' development (not surprisingly!).

Then DB came out with his statement. I was a little surprise at what he said, but it was in a public space and others overheard it too.

Raxxla definitely exists in ED."
