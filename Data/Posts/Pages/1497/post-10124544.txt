Been spiralling over Lombardelli’s Legacy in Persephone.

One link (of many) is the Lombardelli family, which can be traced back to the Germanic tribe the Winnili, also known as Longbeards (Latinised as Langobardi, Italianised as Longobardi, and Anglicized as Langobards or Lombards.

Long beard is another name for Odin. and another name they had was Ansegranus "he with the beard of the gods".

Another interpretation is Langobardi signifies the “inhabitants of the long bord of the river; the lange Börde.

They also worshiped the deity Nerthus or "Mother Earth" often identified with the Norse goddess Freyja or Frigg (remember Friggs distaff?). And there’s a funny myth involving ladies with beards.

Then again if one keeps digging one can find anything, don’t believe it’s relevant.

Just makes me think of M Brookes beard.
