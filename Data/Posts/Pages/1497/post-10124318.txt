What is wrong with if it provably in the game - run with it. How is this hard? This is why I investigate any suspected story arcs. Salomé said the old lore/stories were important.
It’s not hard at all. If it’s in ED it’s in ED.

If it’s not currently confirmed as being in ED then it may be in ED or it may not, except things that are specifically and inextricably tied to being in an alternate reality to ED’s.
