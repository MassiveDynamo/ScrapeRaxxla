Consensus doesn't prove anything. Either it there after an investigation or it isn't.
Consensus wasn’t something I brought up.

But it can have value.

For starters attempting to get a consensus on the validity of your case can improve how robust your investigation or case is. Or it can even demonstrate that your investigation or case is flawed. In that context it can be a very good thing.

On the other hand consensus can also be a bad thing, the most obvious example that springs to my mind being inaccurate quotes which many people think is what was said, despite what was actually said being something different.

(Just to be clear, given that much of the rest of you post was quotes, that last point isn’t being directed anywhere in particular, it’s just a general statement.)
