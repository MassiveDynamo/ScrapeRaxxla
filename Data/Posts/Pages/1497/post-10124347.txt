I think the key to this all is to realise that what you want (in terms of a consensus on what’s lore and what’s not) is in antithesis to the principles of the game.
For clarification.. What do you mean about what I want?

Put simply as a random independent pilot, you should not have what in the context would be preternatural or god level knowledge.
I know some people might think that chosen individuals shouldn't have like God level knowledge. I guess it's up to higher forces to decide who is chosen to have and who isn't.

I don't believe in alternate realities, cause I believe in existence of one reality.
That's like the questions If time travels are possible. Even if traveling in time backwards the time traveler would move forward in time.

Edit: I accept the fact the perception is creating relative reality, but this is more worthy being debated in a philosophical debate and I doubt this is an important matter when it's about the search for Raxxla.

I am still working my way into the lore. The answers I got here were helpful to me to know how I can handle the lore in future.
The important things to know for me at this moment is if
a) is the lore relevant?
b) which of the lore is probably especially relevant for the search
c) does FD already have setted up everything to be explored or is FD using player theories to build the lore.
In that case that could mean even every nonsense theory could become lore.


But I understand what you mean.
