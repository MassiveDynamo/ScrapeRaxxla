Another good example is to consider there being two alternative and mutually exclusive endings for a previous game. If player 1 goes down route A and player 2 goes down route B, and both are mutually exclusive in the history of the game universe, then which one actually happened? Did any? Did an alternate version of events happen to remove the exclusiveness so that both could have actually happened in the ED universe, putting it into an alternate reality compared to the previous game?
Perhaps a better starting place than getting all philosophical is who is relatively reliable? Also, what seems to be core ideas behind Raxxla? How does that impact things if it is real?
