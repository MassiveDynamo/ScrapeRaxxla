Put simply as a random independent pilot, you should not have what in the context would be preternatural or god level knowledge.

IMHO a key part of the game is trying to work out or discover what you can
This - self-discovery of how to proceed is a huge key to making some level of progress. It really is a blaze your own trail kind of search. That said, you need some kind of way to self-check is a idea completely going off the rails. That part is less easy.

I want to make a point, though:

By all rights, I really shouldn't be a seen as some some leader. I am just a CMDR who got exceedingly lucky. That doesn't mean I am exactly convinced we are really that much closer. I mean we don't have definitive proof on TDW despite some progress.
This is my first Elite series game and IRL I was born about 2.5 years before the first game released. I am probably incredibly young comparibly to most CMDRs.
I didn't even start playing until a year or more after Horizons dropped (end of 2016). I started with the odds stacked heavily against me. I simply read lots.
I looked for clues everywhere (even very mundane things) and just kind of ran with ideas if something seemed off.
I still question, why me? Surely more experienced CMDRs should be leading the charge.
