On the previous games, Elite is set in an alternate reality to ED. So it cannot be lore for ED, at least in the sense of it being taken as accurate history of the ED universe. That is not to say however that the two realities are not in many ways parallel - they absolutely are. This comes back to what @Han_Zen said - it’s only lore for ED if it’s actually lore for ED (paraphrasing).
You are making this much harder for yourself. Just because names have changed doesn't mean key things like planets and stations have changed. The only constant is change. The core history of the series is from 3100s to present. Expanded lore goes back to space age on Earth. That's about 1,300 years. Though, technically, with Guardians and Thargoids that pushes it to millions of years.

You at least need to follow Salomé's advice to learn the old stories. Find what seems like it might be relevant to Raxxla then deduce where to look.

What do the rumors of Raxxla include?
How would this impact things?
If I am looking for these impacts, what hints of its' existence would be left?

You cannot just go blindly looking.
