perceptions, interpretations, truth are always a matter from the own position. yes, it's true that the own truth is relative from a certain position. but the relative can only exist because of the absolute ,so in my opinion there is an absolute truth or an absolute state of reality. but its a fact that humans define reality from the own ego.
very interesting theme, especially for those who were chosen to know.
Had some really interesting debates about this in my life.
and yes...there is always a price or a sacrifice one had made.
Desire for a specific outcome can utterly blind people. Since it became increasingly apparent a large portion of the story is sorting through details to find what happened - I stuck with I don't know but I can damn well piece together clues. That said, I revise ideas anytime new info get presented. There is a lot about humans we don't know - nevermind the aliens in Elite Dangerous. The best anyone can do is slowly piece it together and guess at where to look for more details.
