FD has been clear that nothing from the old games are lore, unless it is republished in ED.
Yep, this.

I think what might potentially cause some of the confusion is the meaning of ‘lore’.

There’s lore in the sense of full GM level lore, which is only known to probably just a few people at FD.

Then there’s lore in the sense of info that comes to us as players. That sense of ‘lore’ is obviously the one that’s the relevant one in this context, but if a different interpretation of lore is used then it’s going to end up with things getting muddled.
