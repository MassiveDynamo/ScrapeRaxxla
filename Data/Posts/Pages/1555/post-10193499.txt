Ya i just felt we were kinda lacking in nameless horror in this thread lately
Is it wrong that I've been tempted to poke the hornet's nests that are the "unauthorized" installations (search criteria is centered on Lave as lore starts there)? I found out about these only through trying to understand the Thetis Generation Ship in Nefertem. I am still convinced it passed by one of these prior to all hell breaking loose upon that generation ship. Along that same line of thinking: what exactly makes these installations unauthorized, some outposts "unsanctioned", and some navigation beacons "compromised"? I ask this because my squadron, A.O.E. Allied Order of Exemplars, inhabits one such system possessing a "compromised" navigation beacon. Oddly, I've noticed that finding our home system by searching "Darwin Research Facility" on GalMap rarely if ever works. Yes, there are other places in the galaxy named Darwin which are readily findable. However, it is like our home system was made intentionally difficult to locate. For the record, I had found it a great many years ago when I started studying the Alliance the sites in the nebulas are definitely linked to the Alliance.
