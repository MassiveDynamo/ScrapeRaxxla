I think Thunderchild is a likely reference to The War of the Worlds, where it is portrayed as a ship that is the last defence against the Martian invasion iirc. This seems to be the role that Project Thunderchild has against the Thargoids, although I'm not aware of any evidence of it being active.

I'm not sure if I've been to Pandemonium, at least not for some years, so that is also something I can do over the weekend. The path of the Brookes' tour and the Jacques route being so close could be coincidence but my detective side is screaming "there are no coincidences" at me.
