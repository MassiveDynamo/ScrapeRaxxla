Fortuna was the Greek deity Tyche

Sorry my classics are rusty, so obvious when you view the original source. Tyche was one of the Moirai (Fates) (in game Moirai is relativity close to Artemis)). One of Tyche parents was Okeanos.

Tyche in game is relatively close to Helios. Who witnessed the abduction of Persephone.

Pausanias, Description of Greece 4. 30. 4 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.) : "Homer is the first whom I know to have mentioned Tykhe (Tyche) in his poems. He did so in the Hymn to Demeter, where he enumerates the daughters of Okeanos (Oceanus), telling how they played with Kore (Core) [Persephone] the daughter of Demeter, and making Tykhe one of them."

She was also a playmate of Persephone. Homeric Hymn 2 to Demeter 5. “She [Persephone] was playing with the deep-bosomed daughters of Okeanos (Oceanus)”

Homeric Hymn 2 to Demeter 415 ff :
"[Persephone relates the story of her abduction to her mother Demeter:] All we were playing in a lovely meadow, Leukippe (Leucippe) and Phaino (Phaeno) and Elektra (Electra) and Ianthe, Melita also and Iakhe with Rhodea and Kallirhoe (Callirhoe) and Melobosis and Tykhe (Tyche) and Okyrhoe (Ocyrhoe), fair as a flower, Khryseis (Chryseis), Ianeira, Akaste (Acaste) and Admete and Rhodope and Plouto (Pluto) and charming Kalypso (Calypso); Styx too was there and Ourania (Urania) and lovely Galaxaura with Pallas [Athena] who rouses battles and Artemis delighting in arrows: we were playing and gathering sweet flowers in our hands, soft crocuses mingled with irises and hyacinths, and rose-blooms and lilies, marvellous to see, and the narcissus which the wide earth caused to grow yellow as a crocus."
