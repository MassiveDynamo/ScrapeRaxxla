I've had a minor revelation about the Trinkets of Hidden Fortune:
What if the fact that they are illegal almost everywhere is a hint that we are not supposed to sell them, rather that we need them in our hold for another purpose? Perhaps simply having one will allow us to see something not otherwise detectable.

I'll fit a hatch breaker limpet controller to my Courier, which will leave me with 8t cargo space (I can scoop manually but maybe I ought to use my Python for this work...) and start at Demeter, then head to Ahti and make sure I have a Trinket of Hidden Fortune in my hold before I search the lost and sunken worlds near Pandemonium and Persephone. I would suggest that anyone else exploring the area do the same, though I appreciate it may not be too easy to find any.
