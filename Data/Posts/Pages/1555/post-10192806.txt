I feel it might be good to bring up "The Space In-between" again....

Brookes was fond of Drabbles â€“ there was a thread early on dedicated to them here in the forums somewhere.... On his blogspot he wrote this back in 2014 under a drawing of Yog-Sothoth.

SPOILER: THE SPACE IN-BETWEEN







Later he comissioned a drawing which he ended up getting tattooed on his back... It was also called "The Space In-between". I think we are all familiar with that drawing.... I bring this up because while he might have structured his maze using Milton.... I think it was filled with Lovecraft....
Ive said several times that we really might not like Raxxla when (if) we find it!

It may be an Easter Egg, but it may not be 80% cocoa solids with brandy truffle filling
It may be a Queen Thargoid Egg!!!
