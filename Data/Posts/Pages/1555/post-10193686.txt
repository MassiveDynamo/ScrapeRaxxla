“This container appears to hold an assorted collection of low-value trinkets, knick-knacks and statuette (AHTW statuette-Grandmort?). Such trinkets are generally used by superstitious pilots to try and win favour with the lady Fortuna. However, these particular knick-knacks have a much more valuable prize hidden within.”
I checked - Trinkets container has label “NEX0275401977” VESPINE TRANSPORT SYSTEMS, number is same as SAP8 container (goids ignore both)
