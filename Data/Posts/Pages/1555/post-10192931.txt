I also plotted the beacons thanks to @Edelgard von Rhein. My general concern is these beacons actually look far too separated to be meaningful for triangulation, however I suspect this is intentional obfuscation, and the first step is probably far more important…

The first step of the tour actually traverses right through the ‘underworld’ sector…. very close to the system Pandemonium!

I think this is intended and a pretty big hint, that this specific area is key… question is how?



On a closer inspection the first tour comes very close to the projected path of Jacques… I believe something is in this general hotspot area!



Following this line of the Brookes tour, when we apply the hypothetical 2296 sphere of influence there is one system which sits right on that boundary and directly in the path of the tour, ICZ GM-V b2-4.

It’s likely a coincidence as I actually believe this tours purpose is to draw focus upon these ‘lost realms’ in game.
