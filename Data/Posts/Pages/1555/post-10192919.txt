Time to take my Courier for a spin with a manifest scanner and see if I can find any Trinkets of Hidden Fortune in the Artemis system.

Something in my head is telling me to compare the distances between the tourist beacons (possibly relative to a hidden sixth location) and see if there's a sequence in there.
