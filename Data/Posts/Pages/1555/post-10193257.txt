In Paradise Lost Eve is not the meek character perpetuated by the Church, nor is she evil, she is intelligent and Adams equal, the fall is actually linked to ‘knowledge’ and ‘growth’ as Gods love is effectively ‘being’ ergo stillness in perfection - knowledge is forwards momentum and evolution…
You may want to look into the figure Sophia from the Gnostics and pre-Abrahamic era. She serves a role very similar to Eve but unlike in Christianity and the Abrahamic faiths is a very strong woman. There is a famous poem called "Thunder, Perfect Mind" that I suspect is being referenced by Project Thunderchild in the GCS Saravasti logs (Saravasti is a word for wisdom).

P.S. - I suspect Salomé is supposed to be modeled after a strong Eve or Sophia-like character.
