The Zurara was already dead. Nothing to do (would have been too cool !), end of the story.
The legendary TDW secret home base is supposed alive, with traffic, operations running, etc.. I can't believe "mostly nothing" would happen. Come on.
But I do believe nobody has the slightest idea of how that could be managed in terms of gameplay and storyline. Not even FD. (Besides, the mandatory tourist beacon, of course)
EDIT: oh sorry ! I have an idea. You find the station, it vaporizes you instantaneously and then jumps to another system, the Codex is actualized and people can start the quest again. A tourist beacon Soontill-like pays tribute to the unlucky Cmdr and tells "Here was found the lengendary TDW station by Cmdr X, R.I.P " And you respawn with a gifted Anaconda . Anything else ?

It's a sandbox.

What if the station is hidden in plane site. Instead of being dead, it's being used and under a different name. What if it's revealed by going over all of the FSD#s to discover what it is somehow. Like it doesn't have an FSD number because it's out of the range of the FSD#'s.

This is one of the few things that can be tested thoroughly. If you know where all the official stations are via FSD# and one is out of the 9999 range. Then you have your answer. It could be right under our noses. Has anyone found them all yet and confirmed their potential numbers etc.
