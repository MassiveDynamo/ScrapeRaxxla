The thing is, I hope you notice that only smart people were the ones to even find out about it. Your average player would never have been able to do all these decodes on their own.

You mean the beacon decodes, I assume. IIRC they were just ROT13 substitutions, which aren't exactly difficult. Not that they were necessary for anything but the story, since they didn't actually lead to finding the Zurara.

What did lead to finding the Zurara was a Google-friendly Greek mythology quiz posted on Galnet. And just to make sure we found it on schedule DrewW was on hand to confirm which answers we'd got right. The only tricky part of it was knowing the name 'Rebecca' was significant, since it hadn't been part of any official lore up to that point.

So no, I don't think that it took particularly smart people to solve the Formidine Rift mystery. FDev had decided it needed to be solved by a particular date so they did everything possible to ensure that it was solved by that date, to the point of spoonfeeding us the coordinates of the system.

The last thing I want is for Raxxla to suffer the same fate.
