<edit> cough Polaris </edit>

Yup would be nice to know how to get a Polaris permit. Lave 2 would also be fun.... and Triton? I think that is permit locked too. I tried for a while on the Lave 2 permit but was unsuccessful, I managed to get some missions to the surface, but that turned out to be a bug- still wouldnt let me down.
