So TDW knows where Raxxla is ? It has these coordinates inside its own toast and knows the sequence to follow in order to reach Raxxla ?
Mmmh... Interesting. irony

Mm, didn’t say that! I think more likely the toast is the directions to TDW station, but it is possible that it leads to Raxxla. Think it leads to one of the two!

Edit: I suspect if it’s a set of bearings then it’s likely to be the station, if it’s a set of places that have to be visited in sequence then it’s Raxxla. Ya takes your choice!
