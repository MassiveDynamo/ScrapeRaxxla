I wasn't suggesting 'feet' was a pre-requisite of finding the TDW station or Raxxla. Finding both may have been entirely possible on launch day however, FDev have seen how quick we break their stuff so they may have retconned the idea multiple times to try and make it worthy against growing competition.

In saying we may not get access until 'feet' are a thing I'm working on the assumption FDev were never ready to reveal a solution to TDW or Raxxla until year 8 or 9 of their decade long, slow march through the institutions and as such they had to find better ways to hide or lock us out back in the first 6 months.

They could say yes that content is in the Milky Way (the real one, or the game one?) while knowing full well it's locked behind a permit, a sneaky lie by omission. They might have revisited TDW and Raxxla plans several times as technology got better to improve on the experience so we're not disappointed?

It would appear the best solution we can apply to the task at present, is patience.
