If it's not on some kind of rail, how would it satisfy MB's journey everyone has to take for themselves? Let's say for a moment that the tribute IS the one and only 'clue' required to identify and visit each of six unique locations, in the correct order to automagically add Raxxla to your bookmarks. Then what?

Suddenly a bunch of videos pop up with precise instructions on exactly how to reproduce the same result, and then the forums are drenched in a brine storm of complaints because we can't get in? Do we really want a repeat of the Guardian Ruins mission, that wasn't ready and didn't work, for months?

How would that 'content' be different given the FSS / mapping tools we have now? Seems we devoured it quicker than their cookie cutter creative crew could cope. So maybe it's a case of holding us back so they don't get caught with their pants down or, because they really want to give us something else first?

At least we now know Galnet is a more trustworthy source of tinfoil

How does being on rails stop that? FDev gating the story doesn't mean you won't get YouTube videos telling you how to do it. That's exactly what happened with the Rift - a couple of Cmdrs figured out the solution with 48 hours and then everyone just followed along behind.

The only way for it to be 'a journey everyone takes for themselves' is if the unlock process is sufficiently complicated that people don't immediately know what they've done. A - B - Cing around a bunch of systems clearly doesn't meet that criteria.

That said, we're probably reading far too much into the 'journey' thing anyway.

But whatever the process, I'd much rather someone finds Raxxla because they figured something out, rather than because FDev decide it's time for someone to find Raxxla.
