How does being on rails stop that? FDev gating the story doesn't mean you won't get YouTube videos telling you how to do it. That's exactly what happened with the Rift - a couple of Cmdrs figured out the solution with 48 hours and then everyone just followed along behind.
The thing is, I hope you notice that only smart people were the ones to even find out about it. Your average player would never have been able to do all these decodes on their own.
