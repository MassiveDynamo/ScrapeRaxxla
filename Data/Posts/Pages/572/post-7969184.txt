Oh please no!
The last thing I want is for ANOTHER mystery to be on rails. It was bad enough that the Rift went down that route, but having Raxxla spoonfed to us according to FDev's schedule would destroy it for me.

I'd much rather believe that everything is out there now, and findable.
If it's not on some kind of rail, how would it satisfy MB's journey everyone has to take for themselves? Let's say for a moment that the tribute IS the one and only 'clue' required to identify and visit each of six unique locations, in the correct order to automagically add Raxxla to your bookmarks. Then what?

Suddenly a bunch of videos pop up with precise instructions on exactly how to reproduce the same result, and then the forums are drenched in a brine storm of complaints because we can't get in? Do we really want a repeat of the Guardian Ruins mission, that wasn't ready and didn't work, for months?

How would that 'content' be different given the FSS / mapping tools we have now? Seems we devoured it quicker than their cookie cutter creative crew could cope. So maybe it's a case of holding us back so they don't get caught with their pants down or, because they really want to give us something else first?

At least we now know Galnet is a more trustworthy source of tinfoil
