Good old days indeed!

but Iâ€™ve heard the rooms at that retirement home are a little chilly, & the staff are a bit stiff. [where is it]

Speaking of the good old days:

Gosh you guys are invested! It's fantastic

I wasn't actually proposing Tabby's Star (I didn't know it was called that. Never heard of it before) as a Raxxla candidate at all. The connection I was making was much shallower than that. Jaiotu mentioned Dyson spheres and I just remembered that Youtube video that I watched literally days ago.

I'm still processing that coincidence!

While Tabby's Star isn't a likely candidate since it didn't get public attention until after ED's release there is another possible piece of evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence that predates not only Elite: Dangerous but the original Elite as well. I'm thinking of the "Wow!" signal. From Wikipedia:

"The Wow! signal was a strong narrowband radio signal received on August 15, 1977, by Ohio State University's Big Ear radio telescope in the United States, then used to support the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. The signal appeared to come from the constellation Sagittarius and bore the expected hallmarks of extraterrestrial origin. "

Best part? We have coordinates. We know the Declination beyond a shadow of a doubt and have only two Right Ascensions to choose from. Using hiciacet's equations for convert RA/Declination to Elite's galactic coordinate system we could conceivably plot a course through the galaxy along the route of one set of RA coordinates and then a return trip that would follow the 2nd set. I don't recall any expeditionary attempts to try and locate the Wow! signal source. Could be promising (or could be another hunt for Cassiopeia A).
