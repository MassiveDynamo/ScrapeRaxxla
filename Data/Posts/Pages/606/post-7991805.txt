The more I look at it, the more I am leaning towards the idea that while Raxxla is technically in the game... It isnt a place. It is a ghost in the machine... A seed within the procedural galaxy that will only come to fruition due to a specific set of circumstances. One of which I imagine would be finding the Dark Wheel station.
