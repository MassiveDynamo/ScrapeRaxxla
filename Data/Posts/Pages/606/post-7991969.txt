A bit of tinfoil this morning.

As you know, I like fluff articles in Galnet. They are a good place to insert hints about something completely unrelated, like Raxxla.

This article caught my eye: https://community.elitedangerous.com/galnet/10-AUG-3305

I was particularly interested in the sentence: “The programme is certainly diverse, encompassing everything from megastars like Spectacular Nemesis and Jade Graceland to up-and-comers such as The Lasting Hold.”

It contains the words star(megastars), Nemesis(the name of Alex Ryder's ship) and Jade (a jewel). This prompted me to do a bit of digging on Jade as 'the Jewel'.

The first thing that popped up was a children's book, called 'A Star Named Jade' : https://books.google.no/books/about...EACAAJ&source=kp_book_description&redir_esc=y

Notice that it's written by Grace Cameron (Jade Graceland).
I haven't read the book, but there is a smal extract available: http://www.stanfordhouse.com.hk/uploads/9781458640185.pdf
It seems they are looking for a white star, but there could be more.

I mainly took the title a a key and started to search for real stars named 'Jade'. This lead me to Chinese astronomy. There are a few stars there with Jade in it's name, But the one that caught my interest was Merak(Beta Ursa Major). In Chinese it has several names. The two most common are 'the second star' (of the northern dipper) and 'The Celestial Rotating Jade'. It also has the names 'Huge gate' and 'Whirling star' .

Merak is also the first of the two Pointer Stars. Together with Dubhe (Alpha Ursa Major), they always point to Polaris in the night sky. Following them is the easiest way to spot Polaris.


At certain times on the right latitude, Merak will sit on the horizon with Dubhe and Polaris directly above. This forms a perfect 'Axis Mundi', with Merak as the Omphalos point.

By the Greeks the big dipper was know to form the greater wheel in the North sky, while the Little Dipper made the narrow wheel.

Happy hunting. Tinfoil out.
