Hey guru I haven't seen it for years but there was a total recall TV show called total recall 2070. This might have had more depth to Phillip k 's original material. Not sure if you can find it anywhere nowadays, It was back when Hulu was free that I saw it. Kinda like a crime drama set in the total recall universe.
