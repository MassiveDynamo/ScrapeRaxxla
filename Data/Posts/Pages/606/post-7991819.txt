The more I look at it, the more I am leaning towards the idea that while Raxxla is technically in the game... It isnt a place. It is a ghost in the machine... A seed within the procedural galaxy that will only come to fruition due to a specific set of circumstances. One of which I imagine would be finding the Dark Wheel station.
I agree. I feel it's pretty safe to assume that you got to work your way up to finding a mythical potentially rogue planet / portal to another whatever. I feel like if you can't find a low power station that's not listed in the station index you will have a much harder time finding said mythological potentially rogue planet / portal to another whatever.
