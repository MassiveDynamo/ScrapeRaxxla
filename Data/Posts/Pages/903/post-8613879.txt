Mmm, no, not debunked!
If I remember correctly someone (cant remember the name, see thread about moving TDW towards Sol) recently claimed three livestreamers were at an closed Q&A session (lavecon 2015?) where MB uttered this statement. Apparently two have since recanted and MB responded “no comment” when asked about it. So perhaps “not proven” is more appropriate. Why did two recant- NDA? said in confidence?? Why does one still support this? Why did MB not confirm/deny it?
I’ve already postulated it is not significant in the great Raxxla Quest scheme of things since by 2015 people had already explored out well beyond the bubble so it does not give any real hint about “where” or “what”.
Well it doesn't really rule out permit lock...the CMDR might of got the permit. ;-)
