Another Holdstock Tinfoil angle...

So in Holdstocks book "The Alien World" he introduces us to the Oisir-Raxxla

SPOILER: HOLDSTOCKS MAP

As its been pointed out before ... Oisir is another word for Oyster... The mother of Pearls.
In between the Oisir-Raxxla region and the Human Zone is the "Frontier" and the region called "Samarandara Pearls"...
The term "string of pearls" has often been used to describe galaxies in space. Also the "string of pearls" is an Arabic name for Orions belt...
Maybe a different take on the Jewel on the Brow of the Mother of Galaxies... ?
Also - I like how Frontier is situated between us and Raxxla ...
