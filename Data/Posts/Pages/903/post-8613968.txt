What the heck is going on with Emily? I only ask because of PF 'See Emily Play' and we know or think we know that DB likes the Floyd.

Look up Emily in the GalMap and shes in the middle of a staircase of Brown Dwarfs, much more obvious if zoom out to see the density in general and in the staircase.

Deliberately wrote PF just to confuse things and some of you still wont know what Im on about
The 'staircase' ( I tended to think of them more as potential 'bridges' as these high density linear regions of stars might allow otherwise unreachable things to be reached...) is in a bunch of real imported stars. Have we determined if this name is just part of the imported system names? The PF is rather interesting.

There is a cluster of unique named systems in another staircase near the orion nebula honoring early space pioneers.

It seems more likely to be a general easter egg rather than a clue to raxxla.
