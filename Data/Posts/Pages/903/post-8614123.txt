Is there a source nearer the time, as in someone said it immediately after LaveCon, I mean I imagine it would have been pretty big news and reported widely by quite a few Cmdrs at the time, it must have been a real buzz at that time so there must be a video or blog or something thats not possibly a false memory. Speaking as a historian who likes to authenticate things, ie when did this rumour / story start, at and immediately after LaveCon or 6 months after?

And another Cmdr says he heard it but never went to LaveCon so cant have been there, which means it was apparently said twice on 2 separate occasions and yet witnesses are few and far between?

And also means MB was pretty dumb to say, its in the 0.01% of the Galaxy you have explored, just retrack and scan properly, its in an unscanned system so even more of a clue and then to say it twice! Doesnt really tie in with the rest of the fdev message does it? I don't think MB was dumb, I dont think he said it.

No comment = Im not going to answer a million and one questions about a game I used to be involved in, so I'm not answering any. Take a hint. + NDA about ANYTHING not already revealed/discovered in game just means hes being professional.
