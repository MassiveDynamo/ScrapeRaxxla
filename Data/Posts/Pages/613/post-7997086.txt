there are no trophies in-game for PC players. There are a load from EDSM but that's not pukka. Might be related to system permits, but there are about half a dozen apparently without a granting authority.

One of these is Witch’s Reach, that somebody mentioned recently. Just found 1.2 Wings changes (https://community.elitedangerous.com/en/patch-notes/1.2-wings) and spotted “Adding valuable salvage convoys to three permitted systems: LFT 509, Isinor, Witch's Reach”
