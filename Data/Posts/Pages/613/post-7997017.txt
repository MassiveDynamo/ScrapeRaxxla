why on Earth (or otherwise) is Van Maanen's Star permit-locked? there seems to be absolutely nothing there out of the ordinary!
I have had lots of Van Maanan theories for Raxxla. All of them essentially revolving around the Feds wanting to hide the Martian relic, so they gift the sublime order a system and hide it there (they live underground) and its illegal to enter the system without an invite.
I have spent quite an amount of time exploring it and checking theories, such as its Place 1 in my "pirate treasure map" or that there is a system (rouge planet maybe?) that can only be jumped to from this system.
No theories have come to any fruition so far
