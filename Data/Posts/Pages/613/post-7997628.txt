Just noticed in the NEW FD ingame store, they are selling a map for 100,000 arx. I think it was for Raxxla. I didn't have a lot of time to double check as my Deloren was double parked and the meter maid was heading toward it on her hoverboard.

Wont be able to recheck for a bit as the old flux capacitor needs another rebuild. (of course)
