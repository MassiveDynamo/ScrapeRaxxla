The authors of the books that came out with Elite Dangerous with the package they could purchase from Fdev contained lore that Fdev has not published for all to read.

So I'd "wager" that Drew Wagar has better lore info than what we all know and is probably prohibited from saying anything about the lore he knows that hasn't been released to the public by Fdev yet.

I don't think anybody sensible would take that wager. I'm fairly sure Drew's said in forum posts that he knows more (all the authors were apparently given access to FD's internal storyline book so they could all get their stories straight) but is under NDA and his lips are sealed. But he still makes entertaining lore videos about what is generally known and I think it's a good source to help get newcomers up to speed. As are the videos by Exigeous, Down To Earth Astronomy, and Obsidian Ant, and all the FD-sponsored books, and Drew's lore ED forum thread.
