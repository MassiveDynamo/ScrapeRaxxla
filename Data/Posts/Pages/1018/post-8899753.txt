I was reading this afternoon about Gan Romero. Admittedly, the info is pretty sparse being only a wiki entry and GalNet posts on the story.
Something struck me about this story with regards to Raxxla and was wondering if there is more info on him somewhere, especially his dream journal?
Forgive me if this has been brought up in the previous 1000+ pages.
