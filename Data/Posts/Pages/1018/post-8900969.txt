Well this Jupiter person isn't touching my Type-7. It's the only ship that can fit enough reinforcements and trinkets scrapped from technological artifacts from alien civilizations while still jumping far and boosting into half a kilometre per second in normal space. A bare minimum for any properly paranoid spacer.
You haven't been home for too long. They invented "Drake Class Carrier" lately. Just put it on orbit and it fixes all
