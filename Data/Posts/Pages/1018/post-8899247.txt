there's very little that fdev has actually produced and said involving their lore. What most people who post about lore do is regurgitate what they've read - which may or may not be first hand information.

The authors of the books have first hand info and have interpreted that in the works they've created (which those other guys use as reference material ...unaware of what is first hand and what is artistic freedom.

So yes, i'd still say any author who was given those author packets of information from fdev (and have been to the conventions in-person fdev used to have - which drew has) have a better handle on the game's lore than pretty much any of us who have not.
