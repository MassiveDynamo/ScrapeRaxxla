search for what ? nobody knows what raxxla is. a grid search would have to be 100% complete (visual review of surfaces of all planets/moons, reviewing every uss/poi, looking in every asteroid cluster before declaring a system done and moving on.

that's without even knowing if your grid search has any hope at all of finding it since it could be something that is only discoverable via a trigger of actions such as jumping from a specific starting point to a specific end point or getting a permit that is otherwise ungettable etc.

So short answer, no. all we have is a database of systems we've honked in and the idea that if anyone who doesn't use those third party database systems came across it from honking, they'd have said something.
