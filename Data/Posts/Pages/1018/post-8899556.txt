You're right, I was mis-remembering Robert Holdstock's "Elite: The Dark Wheel" as having been a fictional piece written by Drew (it's been a while since I've read any source material). Thank you for the correction.

Footnote: Elite: The Dark Wheel was packaged with the original game, so it's lore could technically be considered canon. Just wanted to clarify; I'm not saying it's 'fictional' in regards to what knowledge it presents about the in-game Raxxla and Dark Wheel.
TDW novella isn't canon.

It can't be - it's set in what's essentially a parallel universe (one where the galaxy is full of sentient alien civilisations).

That doesn't mean some parts aren't the same as ED canon though. Places, ships, etc.

It's best treated as myth and legend for ED.
