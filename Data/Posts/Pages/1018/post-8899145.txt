The authors of the books that came out with Elite Dangerous with the package they could purchase from Fdev contained lore that Fdev has not published for all to read.

So I'd "wager" that Drew Wagar has better lore info than what we all know and is probably prohibited from saying anything about the lore he knows that hasn't been released to the public by Fdev yet.
