I guess I'm not being clear. I understand barycenters. "A" orbits alone on it's own separate orbit. "B" and "C" orbit each other and also orbit with "A" on a separate non-intersecting orbit. "B" and "C" get very close to the orbit of "A", but just miss. However, B orbits around on it's own separate orbital center (seen in purple) all by itself, with C orbiting B. Elite usually denotes a barycenter for a system by using an "X" where one exists, but there is not one noted for this system.

At least this is what I see when I look at this system and the way it is displayed by Elite. In any event, it's an interesting system and I have searched it to my satisfaction.

o7....

I hope my post did not come across as belittling, that was not my intention. Actually I'm on my way past 27 cass to a nebula, and decided to drop in and grab a screenshot of the orerry since it's being discussed. I provided it for that reason only. When it comes to the discussion on barycenters I think we are mostly saying the same thing. I'm not sure why there are no Xs but in my opinion I don't see anything particularly anomalous in 27 cass B's orbit beyond a standard barycenter around the BC orbit line. I certainly didn't see any light distortion on my way between C and B to suggest another black hole.

Perhaps I'm overly trusting on my ship's UI and should be be more analytical on what's out the actual window.
