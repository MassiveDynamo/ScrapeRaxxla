Well, there are two stars in 27 Cass, the main star "A" and a neutron star "C". According to Elite's wiki, there should be a barycenter for this system, between "A" and "B/C". I think there may be a bug here.

Barycentre
A barycentre is a mutual centre of mass around which two or more bodies orbit. They can be seen on the System Map as lines forming three sides of a rectangle, linking the bodies indirectly. If anything else is orbiting those bodies collectively (as opposed to individually), the barycentre is...

Let me check some other systems on EDSM and see if I can find one to compare with this one.

In any event, no Raxxla here. Moving on....

There IS a barycenter between A and BC. A is in a circular orbit around it, whilst BC is in a much more elliptical one - at least judging from the image, but again 2d v 3d.
No bug, just a regular old system.

Edit:
The fact that A has an orbit at all, tells you there's a barycenter. In single star systems the primary doesn't orbit. In binaries and above, both stars show orbits.
