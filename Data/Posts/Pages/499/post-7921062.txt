Maybe this is where my confusion is, as Elite usually denotes a barycenter by displaying an "X" between the two when one exists. There is none in this system, which I have become accustom to seeing.

I think (I'll have to check) that you only see the 'X' when there are non-stellar bodies also orbiting the barycenter. A planet orbiting both B and C would be named BC1 and you'd see the 'X' against it's row in the System Map.

Edit:
Every system that has more than one star in it has a barycenter.
