I spent five minutes this evening fully zoomed-out watching the system map for the Star of India, whilst in-system. There were no changes at all.
In supercruise, I completed a circuit of the star at a distance of about 290 Ls in line with the Galactic Plane and another at close to right angles to it but I did not see any moving points, so I don't think there is anything hidden off the system map close to the star. I'm in my long range AspX, Orpheus, so I have a good field of view.
It will probably be a day or two before I reach V1357 Cygni, depending on how much time I can make to play this week.
I’ll make som pics. Later this week. I don’t have to be in the system, to trigger the effect.

I think the Star of India dot is left an abow the star. The one in Deneb is far right and down.
