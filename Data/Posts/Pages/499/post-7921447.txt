I've moved on from 27 Cass, through ( explored ) the nearby nebulae and heading towards NGC 7822 that, like Sam, could be seen on the other side of the 27 Cass BH. It's probably due to coincidence that it could be seen but it's shiny and pretty. Maybe see some other Commanders out there as I am always in open. Now I just need to get this ship off this hi-g world.
