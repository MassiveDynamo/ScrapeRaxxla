Just to really drive a nail into this, in my understanding 27 Gamma Cassiopeiae shows B and C orbiting a common barycenter, and then that barycenter "orbits" a common barycenter with A. In the image you provided those planets are not in orbit of any star, but in orbit of the barycenter itself.

Correct me if I'm wrong but this is different to how reality works. ED treats barycenters like an object itself to orbit, probably to reduce that amount of complexity when generating systems in the stellar forge. I doubt ED wanted to simulate the N-body problem during development, so they made barycenters into objects.

Either way this system has sent me on an interesting journey.

Yes, ED massively simplifies gravity, putting bodies in fixed orbits around centers of mass. Given that nobody has actually solved the n-body problem, it's probably asking a bit much of 'realism' in a computer game to handle it.

If you want a REALLY good scifi novel which revolves (pun intended) around the subject, I thoroughly recommend "Three Body Problem" by Cixin Liu.
