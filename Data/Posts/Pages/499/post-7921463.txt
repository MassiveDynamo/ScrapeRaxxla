It's not my intention to give offense or cause any drama, but when every idea is quoted in the next comment followed by "I remember back when we did that and found nothing, it's pointless" it might cause someone to abandon what could be a valuable lead. It seems counter productive, but perhaps I'm taking it too seriously. In any case I volunteer to follow up on any leads.

First: None of us are perfect and always miss something so with most theorys there is quite a probability they're debunked rightfully but also that something may have been overlooked. So always feel free to test out everything you come up with, just don't forget to report your results.

Second: If you want to volunteer feel free to test that idea of mine I postponed for after vacationing: I wanted to go to Helix Sector. It's none too explored and a Helix is a spiral so I thought it worth a look.
