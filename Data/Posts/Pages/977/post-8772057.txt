Winking Cat Tinfoil Incoming.

The scripted live stream yesterday mentioned Winking Cat in two ways. Once with the mention of Ethel Moonshot and then the Sagittarius Eye magazine on the desk was the one that had Winking Cat on the cover. This Winking Cat stuff happened over a year ago now.

I remember previously on another live stream one of the female employees stated that the Winking Cat article of Sagittarius Eye was her favorite one.

What are we missing regarding this Winking Cat stuff. Thereâ€™s got to be something there.
