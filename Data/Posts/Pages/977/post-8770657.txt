Interesting fact:
The name “Pamela” was invented by the sixteenth-century poet Sir Philip Sidney (of Astrophil & Stella fame), (amazing what knowledge crops up on TV’s Pointless quiz!). Pamela is possibly derived from the Greek words pan meaning all and meli meaning honey.

There is apparently a “Cobra Elite” series of books by Pamela Clare...
