Interesting fact:
The name “Pamela” was invented by the sixteenth-century poet Sir Philip Sidney (of Astrophil & Stella fame), (amazing what knowledge crops up on TV’s Pointless quiz!). Pamela is possibly derived from the Greek words pan meaning all and meli meaning honey.

There is apparently a “Cobra Elite” series of books by Pamela Clare...
PAMELA pops up all the time, when I search for Dark Matter connections.

Has PAMELA Already Seen Dark Matter?
(PhysOrg.com) -- Back in 2006, PAMELA (a Payload for Antimatter Matter Exploration and Light-nuclei Astrophysics) was launched with the purpose of detecting cosmic radiation and looking for clues pointing to dark matter. And now it's possible that PAMELA might have already spotted dark matter.
