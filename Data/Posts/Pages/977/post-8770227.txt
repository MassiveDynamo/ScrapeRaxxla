Checking back in....

Found and identified:
The Jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies
The whisperer in witchspace, the siren of the deepest void
Very educated guess on what Raxxla is / how to use "the doorway that is also the key"
Hopefully I'll be posting a picture of the 'doorway' and The Dark Wheel station in the next 1 or 2 days.
Reactions:
