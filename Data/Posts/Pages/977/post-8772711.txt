I agree, the Channel 4 broadcast, although rather strained did feel overtly heavy, are they so lost for irony that they're employing Raxxla etc as easy source material, or as I fear gearing us up for some future content drop.

I do hope they dont pull the same shenanigans for Raxxla that they have done for the 31st October event, because it makes me suspicious that Raxxla isn't active (but in game) and only sleeping, awaiting some future narrative to activate it.

I hope this is not the case.

However the broadcast does feel like a heavy hint; that the clues are out there, but we're not seeing them for what they are, its either likely far too obvious, or unsolvable because its not 'activated'.

I was realy interested by the emphasis on something smelling really bad...made me think of the omphalos....the rift beneath the Pythia, of Pythos rotting corpse (or Delphyne / same dragon different name)...

Fun times.
