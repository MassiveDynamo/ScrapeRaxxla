Raxxla is expressly linked to pirates via Tornvquist rumors.

Tornvquist was based out of Tau Ceti not in it.

From my post linking the Pegasi Sector (still pirate territory in 3310):

At the bottom of that entry is this in "See also":
Which leads us to ... Skaoismont deep in the Pegasi sector (no not suspicious whatsoever)

There is a Wingquist Station in Skaoismont (outpost so you need a medium ship to dock). Maybe do missions for pirates out there.

While we're mentioning Pegasi Sector it seems Harma Silver Sea Rum is quite ancient:

Based on a secret 24th Century recipe taken from the log of one Captain Smolenski, Harma Silver Sea Rum has been developed by blending a range of rare alcohols to create a beverage any corsair would be proud of. The Harma Silver Cartel, who manufacture and distribute the potent brew, enjoy the controversy their product has gleaned after it became a favourite among pirate gangs across the galaxy. This rare good is legal in all systems except for Prison Colony systems as well as Federal and Alliance Theocracy systems.

Proving yet again, FDev hides stuff via descriptions.
