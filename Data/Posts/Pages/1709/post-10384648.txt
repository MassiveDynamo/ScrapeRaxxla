So long stretch, I mapped some deities linked to alcohol and two seem to be relatively close to the area of interest.
Humor me: Dionysus is Artemis' half-brother by way of Zeus.

The Maenads play an important role in FFE lore via the journals. The Maenads are female followers of Dionysus or via Roman mythology Bacchus. Now neither is a system in game. However, Sirius Inc. has the megaship Dionysus in HIP 17044.

TDW is known for its raucous, strong-willed women. Follow the Maenads. It may be worthwhile as secondary pathway, to investigate if systems are in-game with names tied to the cults of Artemis and Dionysus.

While we on the subject of interesting family ties: at least according to many ancient stories the deity of heaven and the underworld were family. In Greek mythology, they are brothers (Zeus and Hades). In Roman mythology, the same was true (Jupiter and Pluto). This may be important in light of TDW's rumors of specific families making up the core of The Dark Wheel.
