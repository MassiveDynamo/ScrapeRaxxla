Getting a little tired of academic exploration so going to put down some roots in Avalon and look at building rep in all factions at Persephone dock, and doing what Hammer liked almost as much as drinking; killing pirates.

I’m wondering if Persephone is the eminent clue, she’s referred to indirectly in the codex, then her path can be identified through the Lost Realms via the Codex again, she’s evidently omitted from Legacy’s list of deities, her presence too is interesting, in a zone interacted by Brookes Tours, and Avalon looks hand made, raises some suspicion, who knows; but I’m realising I’ve not interacted with the factions in over a year now, so handed in a years worth of exploration data and going to see if anything drifts by,
