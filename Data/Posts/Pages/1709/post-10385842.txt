Been pondering the Paradise Lost Garden design. In the last month or so I've assumed the 6 trees in the broad path indicate 6 moons of a ringed planet. However:

ED codex was released in Beyond - Chapter Four 11 DEC 3304 (2018). Planetary ring mining hotspots were also added at the same time, while in Beyond - Chapter Four - Exploration Reveal livestream 18Oct2018 : @1:29:58 Adam Bourke-Waite (Senior Designer) said “that thing we haven’t shown” (i.e. Raxxla codex entry) “there’s elements of that that are probably my favourite parts of this”.

So, I now believe the middle part of the garden design is indicating that Raxxla is located at/in a planetary ring having 6 mineral hotspots. In the garden design the circles falling across the path edges of that middle panel suggest the system could have more than 4 bodies, which increases the potential number of systems to be investigated. Logically the right hand panel should show the location of Raxxla within the ring, but that solution is not clear to me. Perhaps the logo shows the precise location? But that solution doesn't leap out at me either.

Looking in a planetary ring for something, but I don't know what, is tedious...rings are huge! But first we've gotta find the correct ring in the correct system??? And then the correct place within the ring????????????
