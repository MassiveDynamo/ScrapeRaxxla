I agree with Jorki, we need to be actively searching in-game actually following up leads and proposing ideas rather than trying to tear down and argue about lore.

Who's gonna follow Neptune and who's gonna follow Oberon?

Honestly ... we're talking about Raxxla here. In the "Lore & Roleplay" section of the forum. Raxxla is nothing if you separate it from its lore.
