I’ve not read the entirety of this post, but I’ve read the last 10-15 pages. I need to do more research on The Club, and get my elite combat rank, but I believe that disrupting the club in the form of lockdowns is absolutely worth a shot. Physically blocking ports isn’t really my thing, but I don’t mind racking up a huge bounty against npc traders and cops to help initiate a lockdown.

Certainly. Even if I can’t cant get peeps to help in a blockage, it does sound boring tbh so I can’t blame people, but I don’t think the thought would leave me if I didn’t at least try. I’d like to help in locking down some systems too. Heck if we can get some people together maybe we could even remove Sirius Corp from controlling power in their own system. Just have to do some propaganda on the forum and comms so it’s a bit of a public thing. The idea being to disrupt and call attention to them to smoke them out of their hole, and hopefully gain the attention of TDW.
