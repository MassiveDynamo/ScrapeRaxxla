I’ve not read the entirety of this post, but I’ve read the last 10-15 pages. I need to do more research on The Club, and get my elite combat rank, but I believe that disrupting the club in the form of lockdowns is absolutely worth a shot. Physically blocking ports isn’t really my thing, but I don’t mind racking up a huge bounty against npc traders and cops to help initiate a lockdown.
