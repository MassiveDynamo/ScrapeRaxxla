Imho your idea is not that bad but should be refined. At the moment it‘s a bit like denying a certain winged MC service at your filling station. If you really want to get the Club annoyed find out what their core business is and blow that up.

Perhaps. I’m just thinking that because the message said The Club gets their funding from traders, miners, bounty hunters etc and they exploit exploration data sold to them, blockading a capital port so to effectively halt its economy and thereby the business and data they rely on could get their attention. That and it was one of the suggestions of Salomé and, I assume, by extension TDW.
