Find out where the Club Partners take most of their Profit. What are their centers of power. Me and my FdL will fly aside ypu on PS4. Hit em where it hurts. But before that we should find out whether there is a left behind in 46 Eridani.

46 Eridani could very well be important I agree. Iâ€™ll prolly check it out too. Seems that The Club operates mostly through the profits of the three major powers, but is also known to be highly influential in Sirius Corp, and the Engineer Bill Turner. So perhaps economically disrupting their Headquarter Station in Sirius might also be a good target.

Would be a big undertaking requiring a lot of cooperation from many people. But putting Sirius and the Three capital systems into lockdown simultaneously would be something
