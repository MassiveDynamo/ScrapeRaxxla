Heck if we can get some people together maybe we could even remove Sirius Corp
Such attempt was made a few years ago, I think they had some success even. Temporary, of course, you can't remove Sirius Corporation. They own half of the bubble, and are the true intelligence of the humanity. I think I was involved in carrying Unknown Artifacts to stations owned by groups taking part in this, but cannot quite remember, good old times they were.

How strange they suddenly started having these security issues in the Pleiades.
