Idk if this has been mentioned before, I’ve tried to keep up with the thread but at 400 pages it can get away from me sometimes so if it’s a repeat I apologize. But I was docking at a station yesterday, it was an Orbis station with 5 solar panels at the rear. It struck me that when approaching directly from the front, it made a near perfect copy of the Raxxla Symbol from the codex. The station making up the center, and the 5 solar panels making up the five lines between the black quasi diamond shapes (which are empty pace between them.) the only thing different is that Orbis stations heads are circular from the front and the symbol is hexagonal. So, are there any Mobile Coriolis shapes stations? Or Orbis stations that are hexagonal that we know of?

Or perhaps a generation ship for that matter, some of those have five spokes that would look quite similar from the front. Just a matter of the shape of the head.

5 solar panels would make a pentagon, not hexagon.
