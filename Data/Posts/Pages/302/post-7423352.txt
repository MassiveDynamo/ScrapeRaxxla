I was pondering about 46 Eridani myself earlier. Might still be something there to find, and it should at least be in somewhat close proximity to where she picked up her data, if not in that system itself.
Given the story, I do think a blockade on open is worth a shot. If anyone with a Sol permit wants to give it a try at Mars High or other ports in systems of importance I’m certainly willing to donate a couple hours time to it, if nothing else but to eliminate or confirm the idea. I’ll try to sit real close to the slot in solo when I get home to see if it can be done without gaining an infraction. If so I figure I’ll make a post in discussion to let people know to minimize inconvenience to pilots, and also perhaps encourage others to do the same.

Imho your idea is not that bad but should be refined. At the moment it‘s a bit like denying a certain winged MC service at your filling station. If you really want to get the Club annoyed find out what their core business is and blow that up.
