Perhaps. I’m just thinking that because the message said The Club gets their funding from traders, miners, bounty hunters etc and they exploit exploration data sold to them, blockading a capital port so to effectively halt its economy and thereby the business and data they rely on could get their attention. That and it was one of the suggestions of Salomé and, I assume, by extension TDW.

Ok. In RL I am a defence Attorney and to tell you something: To blockade a side business of a club won‘t annoy them a bit. Attack their core business and you‘ll get attention.
