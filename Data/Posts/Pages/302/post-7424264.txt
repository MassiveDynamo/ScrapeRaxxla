I agree with Jorki, we need to be actively searching in-game actually following up leads and proposing ideas rather than trying to tear down and argue about lore.

In my honest opinion, I am convinced the toast is actually a veiled map and it seems The Void comes up a lot when researching, this leads me to believe that The Void is definitely a step on the path to R. How exactly it fits into the overall map is unknown as of yet. I am not in a position to reach The Void as it is and I doubt there are many CMDR's paying attention to this thread are??

If we could poke around that area it would be a step towards either confirming or debunking the theory.

Another thing that plays on my mind is the 'Portal' aspect of the legend, portals have two ends, may be worth keeping this in mind whilst trying to decode the toast. It's a slim chance but maybe we need to find the portal that ends at R rather than R itself?
