Right on, Commanders !
But be aware that while the witch Salomé was summoned by Rebecca (TDW) to become the CoR High Priestess, it doesn't imply that she was a member of the organisation.
Just another toy. The medallion thing was a hoax.
Nor TDW had a special interest in unveiling the Club or messing with the Powers. They called the witch because CoR asked for their help.
Iirc, of course.

‘You promised you would help us,’ the second man prompted. (CoR)
‘And so I (TDW) have, my dear Lestenio. I have selected you a leader.( Kahina)’
