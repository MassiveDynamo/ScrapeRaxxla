That would certainly work I’m sure, and I’m sure you’re right given your expertise. But I’m not sure how to do that since it would seem their core buisiness is to manipulate people, and collaborate to steer events in their favor. They don’t seem to sell or deal in anything, they just use their cut of trade, mining and combat profits to fund their ambitions, and use exploration data to locate Earth-Like worlds that they have some kind of plan for. I suppose I could work to encourage people to deal only with independent ports, but to get players to agree to that on a large scale would be quite the task. Forcing them away from aligned ports would seem the more direct option. I could be wrong of course, and am certainly open to suggestions.

Find out where the Club Partners take most of their Profit. What are their centers of power. Me and my FdL will fly aside ypu on PS4. Hit em where it hurts. But before that we should find out whether there is a left behind in 46 Eridani.
