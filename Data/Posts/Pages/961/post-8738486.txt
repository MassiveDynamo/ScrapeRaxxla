Sooo...what do we think?

SPOILER
It might be better if the outer ring with the text had a darker background. It is a lot of 'highlighter yellow' at the moment. The triangle head of the rank thing could probably be omitted. (or have the inner dot inscribed or centered in the triangle.)

The start date might moved back to around 3125 or 3100 (as a nod to the dark wheel novella, and cmdrs hunting raxxla in 1984 elite) to match the approximate date listed here: https://canonn.science/lore/drewwagar-the-dark-wheel/.
