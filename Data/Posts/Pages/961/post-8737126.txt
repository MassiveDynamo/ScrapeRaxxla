Definitely Cosmic Chicken first - I was running away from things long before the Egg-sploit was found and I never went near it either.



If we are lucky we can maybe get a Decal 'I found the Raxxla thread and all I got was this Decal' or 'I survived the Raxxla thread and all..'
How about, "I contributed to the Raxxla thread..."
