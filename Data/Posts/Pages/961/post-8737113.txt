Definitely Cosmic Chicken first - I was running away from things long before the Egg-sploit was found and I never went near it either.

@Macros Black How's preparations for the 20,000 posts party coming along?

Maybe we can convince FDev to give us a CG that takes us closer to Raxxla?

If we are lucky we can maybe get a Decal 'I found the Raxxla thread and all I got was this Decal' or 'I survived the Raxxla thread and all..'
