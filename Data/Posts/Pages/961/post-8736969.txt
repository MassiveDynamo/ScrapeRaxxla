Durga mother of the universe... with a third eye (jewel) on her brow (the fire of the sun). One of her forms is Kushmanda ... cosmic egg... source of the power of the sun... ya been looking for connections.
I really didn't have time to read everything that I found, but if you think about it, will the developers really accept the reception with ancient Greek mythology again? too simple .... you need to read more about Indian mythology, the pearl is often mentioned there and has many meanings, there is even a link to the moon ...

But if you think logically, it might be worth starting from the very beginning))) let's say someone finds a raxxla, why does he call it that way? there must be logic ...
