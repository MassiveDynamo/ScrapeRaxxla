there is a very stupid assumption, it seems the Zulu Romeo argued that the black hole emits a signal, in fact, it's a whisper from space.
it turns out that the pearl is a sol, and the second line is a kind of black hole, have any ideas what might happen next?)

in the English version its jewel:


as in emeralds, sapphires, diamonds etc.

Of all the jewels, the only jewel that can burn is diamond as all the others are oxides.
