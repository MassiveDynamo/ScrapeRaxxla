A bit more on Raxxla and Sirius

As most people in this dark corner of the forum are regulars, I'm sure you remember my post about a potential Raxxla / Sirius connection: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showt...-Find-Raxxla?p=6154193&viewfull=1#post6154193

I've gathered some info about the Sirius system, to see if anyone can make sense of it.

First the basics
SPOILER

Lots of numbers. [big grin]

The Sirius system looks more or less exactly like this:


Sirius A and Sirius B orbits the center of gravity, approximately every 49.73 years. The maximum distance between them is 20 AU. The minimum distance is about 8.15 AU.
Currently we are very close to the maximum, with an in-game distance of almost 19.9 AU.

According to Salom√©, the federal documents about Raxxla were dated 2814. Some 489 years ago.

489/49.73 = 9.83 laps of rotation or that we are about 8 years off(early) the position of the system in 2814. Hopefully federal bureaucracy used a bit of time with the archiving and Raxxla was found a few years before.

Other possibly interesting points:

- Lucifer is marked as tidally locked, but has 99 D orbital period and 4.9 D rotational period. It's in a 20:1 resonance. Not seen that elsewhere.
- Waypoint orbits Sirius A in and almost centric orbit at 2 AU. This is exactly 1/10 of the max distance between A and B. The system COG will at times be inside the orbit of Waypoint.

Just a few observations. Keep searching. [where is it]
