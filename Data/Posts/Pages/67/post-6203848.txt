One system that we are currently aware of.
Who's to say there isn't another system somewhere that's permit locked until you're Elite?

The Elite requirement is linked to organisation 'The Dark Wheel', not Raxxla it self.

It's basically(lore wise) a requirement if you want to find Raxxla with the help of The Dark Wheel. If you think you can do it on your own, you probably don't have to worry about ranks.
