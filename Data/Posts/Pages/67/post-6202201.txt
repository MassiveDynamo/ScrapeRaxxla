At that question asked by DJTruthsayer MB answered: " ... mmmmh ..That's true, but I think you have to make some of it a tiny little bit obvious etc..." which turns this actually to be both the best and unique clue.
But what am I telling you, Doc ? You were there, participating at the interview chat in real time !

Remember that this "celestial body..this place that is not a place..that key which is also the door...the myth" is told to be " obfuscated ..." What I can't determine, is if it is obfuscated because of being far away in the " outer rim" or because some other reason..
I suspect it being in a tiny locked region, maybe not yet discovered.

I take obfuscate to mean distract, muddy. The Elite deliberately put out disinformation on it and its whereabouts. Interestingly the same was done with the (real) location of Founders World. The monument in Shinrarta Dezhra says as much.

I cant help but think that what we are seeing underlying the Formidine Rift and the Elites role there ties in. Well at least that's the line I'm pursuing.

There was a system which is locked to permit only in the Dark Wheel story which I'm intrigued to pursue as my next avenue
