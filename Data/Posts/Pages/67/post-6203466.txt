There might well be, but I don't want to go round and round again having the discussion about why I don't think Raxxla is outside the bubble any more

It's interesting to note though that the Elite ranking it means in TDW related solely to kills - essentially Rafe was telling Ryder to learn to be a killer - not just a killer, but a really good killer in order to find Raxxla.

Quite an odd requirement to find a lost planet don't you think? EDIT: Sorry meant to add - Maybe finding Raxxla isn't hard, it's getting there that's hard - as in, you need to be Elite, which is pretty hard to do - but actually finding Raxxla (or knowing where it is) isn't hard.

The reason Rafe said Alex needed to be Elite wasn't because of a permit lock. The reason was that Raxxla is already occupied by Ã©lites. I expect that, once found, a lone explorer without weapons or proper defensive equipment isn't going to survive very long. It's not just about finding Raxxla. It's about liberating it from those who are currently exploiting it for their own nefarious purposes.
