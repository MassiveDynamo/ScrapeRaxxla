I was re-reading The Dark Wheel and thought this was interesting:
" 'One thing's for sure,' Rafe went on drily. 'Unless you get there, unless you become Ã©lite, you'll never get to Raxxla. And you'll never know exactly what your father was searching for.' "

Which sort of matches the statement about "personal journey". As "unless you get there" implies travel, just not in the physical sense with "unless you become Elite", which is a state of being / Pilot Rank. Anyway interesting.

And there's only one system in the game where you need to be Elite to go there (or be a kickstarter backer)...
