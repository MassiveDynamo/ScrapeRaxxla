The Elite requirement is linked to organisation 'The Dark Wheel', not Raxxla it self.

It's basically(lore wise) a requirement if you want to find Raxxla with the help of The Dark Wheel. If you think you can do it on your own, you probably don't have to worry about ranks.

'One thing's for sure,' Rafe went on dryly. 'Unless you get there, unless you become élite, you'll never get to Raxxla. And you'll never know exactly what your father was searching for.'

The natural reading of Rafe's statement is that the "there" that Alex needs to get to is the rank of élite. The entire conversation leading up to this revelation is Rafe telling Alex that his father, Jason, believed that he had what it takes to reach the highest combat rank. This of course leads up to our introduction to The Dark Wheel and the revelation that Rafe himself was once élite but that ever since he lost his edge he is "not part of it anymore. Not to that degree. But I watch and I listen, and I do what told."

So yes ... I think your reading is exactly right. Working with The Dark Wheel requires an Elite combat rank ... and is probably a reason why they would have shielded themselves at Shinrarta Dhezra ... it reduces the number of "not worthy" candidates knocking on their doors.
