There might well be, but I don't want to go round and round again having the discussion about why I don't think Raxxla is outside the bubble any more

We'll just pretend we've had the discussion and that I still think you're wrong

It's interesting to note though that the Elite ranking it means in TDW related solely to kills - essentially Rafe was telling Ryder to learn to be a killer - not just a killer, but a really good killer in order to find Raxxla.

Quite an odd requirement to find a lost planet don't you think? EDIT: Sorry meant to add - Maybe finding Raxxla isn't hard, it's getting there that's hard - as in, you need to be Elite, which is pretty hard to do - but actually finding Raxxla (or knowing where it is) isn't hard.

I think that FDev had a better method for players finding Raxxla than them just stumbling into a particular system in a galaxy of 400 billion. At least I HOPE they do. Whatever the requirement is for us to get the knowledge will be difficult, but then getting to Raxxla itself will be easy.
