What Iâ€™m looking for is two greek names (possibly gods since they caused these things) or words that represent the grief/woe/loss/fernweh and are in-game systems..

Its been discussed on here already and I cant remember the names but the obvious fit is the one about the lass who gets kidnapped by God of the Underworld, also includes Sirens.

I still think the missing line in the toast is 'Raxxla is a curse and the cause of'... The Parents Grief etc etc
