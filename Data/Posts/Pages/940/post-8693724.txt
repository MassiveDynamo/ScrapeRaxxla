yeah usual flavour text, the inbox message will disappear on relog, implies to me its nothing more than flavour. Very interested to read Zulu actually meant something at all. Makes me think all the others do as well, have a basis in RL, and seemingly often in Shipping or British Navy.



Widen it to 'loss' of a child. Might have lost a child to a cult, to an adventure, to an addiction (fernweh), not brilliant examples but....



Yes, and the 2 could be the same reason.



I had a theory its either contained in one of the novels/novellas published with the game or its just flavour to acknowledged and dismiss this old myth in place of the retconned one. Seemingly the latter from the Codex.



I think t just gives a 'long history' or 'mythological status' to the myth of Raxxla. ie its not new its ancient



Agreed, but wouldnt be the first time. Cant see it however, the entrire thing would be wrong not just one word or sentence. Agree with you.




I think its something like this if not this exactly. Some signal or info that mentions Raxxla but we never actually found it, just this hint of it.



941 Pages and you mention this now! Jorki! What else does everyone assume we know that some of us have no idea about if we only been playing year or two? Where was the source can you remember? GalNet? Going to check this out asap. This is exactly the sort of thing I'm looking for as the 'source' of the myth of Raxxla.
