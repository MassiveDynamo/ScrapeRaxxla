Its been discussed on here already and I cant remember the names but the obvious fit is the one about the lass who gets kidnapped by God of the Underworld, also includes Sirens.

I still think the missing line in the toast is 'Raxxla is a curse and the cause of'... The Parents Grief etc etc
Persephone. Kidnapped by Hades and she ate some pomegranate seeds while down there. Therefore it was agreed upon that she would spend 6 months of the year with hades and 6 months with her mother, Demeter. So while she’s gone her mother grieves and it becomes winter (since she’s the goddess of the harvest) and while she’s topside it’s summer and hades is without his wife.
