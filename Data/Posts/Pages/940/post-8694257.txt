I have found yet another anomaly in the Galactic Map I cannot explain. I have headed back to the bubble using Sol as a good pinpoint where I noticed something odd. If I zoom close to Sol there appears to be connected systems nearby... almost like warp directions ie, your options on where your drive can take you. However these lines are much thicker and can only be viewed from the areas around Sol. Also some of the connections go a lot further between systems than a conventional drive could go. If you move the map away from Sol they vanish. They almost look like constellations but nothing I know of. I have also played with map filter settings and they do not effect anything.
It is hard to explain so anyone ( I'm on PC ) can verify if I am not going mad or missed something I would be grateful.

EDIT. Bloody ninja'd by Garand! How odd!
