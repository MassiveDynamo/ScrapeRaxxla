Sorry but I think some people forget (myself included), this is a software product, not the real world. All this was invented by people.
And the real thing is to find old interviews with the developers, what they said about Raxxla, at least what it was in Elite 1 and Frontier and FFE.

I think in those days they didn't even think about the release of Elite 4 and might have let it slip what they meant.
