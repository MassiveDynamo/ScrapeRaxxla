So basically

Raxxla is Raxia?
No, Spiff is saying Raxxla=Gallia, one of the asteroids, specifically 148 Gallia.
I see the point. It's suggestive, but not overwhelmingly convincing. However it does fit with strange behaviour at the asteroid belt so I wouldn't discount it offhand. I keep an open mind on this point.
