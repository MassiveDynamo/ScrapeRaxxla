@Jorki Rasalas : "I’m undecided about the visual resemblance of Gallia to Raxxla. May be a thing, may not be."

So what's funny about this is, I remember when I first started poking around Raxxla, coming across this and passing over it quite easily for the same reason... just seemed inconclusive, and... reaching. But then, all this OTHER stuff with the asteroid belt... so now, there's a bit more validity.

But what I think sells it for me, is if you take a look at each individual letter. The greek symbol for g, Γ .... that is visually an r . Then the a's... they are obvious that they are same, and in the same spots. This is unfortunate in that our mind almost skips by them in terms of admitting them as evidence that they fit the puzzle. But then again, fortunate in that they obviously very much DO fit.

Then the XXs... the biggest "stretch". But consider it is two of the same letter, in the same spots. And then if you try and think about "if I were to try and code that into a current letter of our alphabet, something we could speak.. what letter would it be?" you inevitably arrive at "X". And to back that up a bit, take a look at this...

Going back to staticvoids original post, Γαλλία is the translation for Gaul. So there it is, but translated in modern text. And there are our Xs.

So from here, all we have left is the i = l. Visually, they are much the same. And with the rest of the word/name in place, it doesn't even matter at this point if they match up or not. You could argue for the visual match, or you could argue for artistic license and the fact that he would have just wanted a great name for some integral part of a great story and universe (Raxxla > Raxxia, imo)

And again, I chuck this at the "what are the odds that this isn't related-o-meter".. they are virtually nil

So basically

Raxxla is Raxia?
