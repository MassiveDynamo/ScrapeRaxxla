Just reading the various Sol theories of Jorki and Rochester and others, which are attractive I must admit. They also have the advantage that if correct, Raxxla could be found with the original game's 7LY hyperdrive, which usually is seen as a constraint. I originally thought the six lines might have referred to either an Elite requirement (but there are nine, not six ranks) or the Fed rank of Petty Officer needed for the Sol permit (but it is rank 4 of 14). But, getting the permit would qualify as a personal journey...

I also like the Song of the Spheres connection, as Han Zen brought it up years ago, albeit in a completely different context. Now if only there was a whale in there somehow...
