A thought I have on the missing asteroid clusters in Sol. Couldn't they be in the same boat as the apparent missing outer rings around some gas giants?
Where they are there on the system map but not visible in game. I emergency dropped out on one of these rings a while back by accident. It was literally so thin that I didn't see any impact warnings in game or on screen at all until I hit it. When I looked round my ship on the outside I saw nothing, just the blackness of space. But when I switched to night vision I was in a very thin vail of fine dust particles hidden to the naked eye. I could jump out to super cruise but immediately dropped back to normal space. There wasn't enough mass to mass lock me but enough for it to cause an emergency drop.

Just a little theory on the missing Asteroids clusters.
