I tried going out to lemon slice nebula last night. Spansh said I could make it but my route plotting failed with only 1900Â±ly. I know it was kind of a joke when it was posted but you never know. I can only find references to it being unreachable before FC but now that I have one, does anyone know a route? I've seen that someone has been there on yt.
No, Lemon Slice is not visitable with FCs. Maybe someone was put there as a special gift as FDev has done in the past with unreachable systems far outside the galaxy, for special reasons e.g. that terminally-ill fellow who had it as a special request.
