Folks,

I've tried replicating getting the FSD message (overcharged) flying from Sirius A to B. Unless I scoop the dwarf, I don't get the message.

It's happened once before but not sure how to replicate this. Do other have this every time they go from A -> B? Or just occasionally?

I think I get it pretty consistently.
