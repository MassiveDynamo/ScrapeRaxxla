Is it possible? Certainly. Is it likely? I personally doubt it. If Mr. Brookes had wanted an Elite/Cthulhu connection he had ample opportunity to do so in writing Elite Legacy.

Ah ha!
Clear evidence of misdirection!
And only a glancing reference to Raxxla, 14th word on page 58 in chapter 6 of his 455 page book!
And yet visiting coordinates of all possible combinations of the numbers in all four quadrants, still no Raxxla!
Yet I see many have been there.
Suspicious absence indeed!

Don't all Cthulhu stories end with the gate opened and "Say anyone notice an off switch?"
