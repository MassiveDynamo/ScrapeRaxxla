It's an interesting question - I like the idea that if and when Raxxla is found, there's the possibility that FD could spin off some pretty wild sub-games into other galaxies/universes/dimensions where we are outside of the realm of our usual galaxy. That would be awesome.

Yes ... we finally discover Raxxla only to find out that it was Planet Coaster all along.
