So IMHO there are some small connections between Lovecraft and Raxxla. It may not be the key, but perhaps it is a small piece of the puzzle.

I'd personally like to think that, if there is a literary connection to Raxxla, that it would be to Holdstock and not Lovecraft. It would make a fitting memorial.
