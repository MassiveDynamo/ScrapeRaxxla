Just flew out to Sirius to check on the "FSD operating outside safety limits" message. I didn't get it on my trip out to Sirius B this time. I did, however, get the message when traveling BACK to Sirius A. Immediately came to a stop. Message was about 1,300Ls out of Sirius B.

I usually get more of them going B->A to.
