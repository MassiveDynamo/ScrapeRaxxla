Is it possible? Certainly. Is it likely? I personally doubt it. If Mr. Brookes had wanted an Elite/Cthulhu connection he had ample opportunity to do so in writing Elite Legacy.

I don’t think that there will be a 1:1 connection to the Cthulhu myth. But there could be similarities.

For example in the C-Myth there is a place called Rˋlyeh. Which is a lost city that will appear at a certain star constellation.
So this could be the same for Raxxla.

Also there Aare the Dreamlands which are gates to other dimensions that can be found in far away areas and are dangerous to be found.

Furthermore there is a dark (rogue?) planet in our solar system named Yuggoth with large dark cities as well as Black rivers and an old civilization living there.

So IMHO there are some small connections between Lovecraft and Raxxla. It may not be the key, but perhaps it is a small piece of the puzzle.
