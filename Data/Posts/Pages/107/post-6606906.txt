Whenever I'm in the system about 3-5 minutes into the flight. Maybe some of us are the chosen ones

I think I get it pretty consistently.

I thought there were two types of messages:

1) FSD overcharged - when you scoop from a jet stream;
2) FSD operating over the safety limits - when you start heading out of a system in SC and keep going. I've had these when searching for bodies way out in (pretty much any) system.

Is that right? I get (2) when I head out. Perhaps we've all been getting our wires crossed. One point when I was scooping Sirius A I was pretty sure I got (2) - though it might have been (1) - this is what I am trying to replicate.
