Wait a minute ... if Lucifer is tidally locked would it's dynamo even work? Anyone with a specialty in physics willing to try and work that out?

From what I can see, Lucifer is 1:1 tidally locked.
The 99 days orbit period in system info, seem to be a typo.
I have bug reported it.

The dynamo stuff could still work, I guess?
From a point on Lucifer(stator) facing Sirius B(rotor), Sirius B will have it’s own rotation and the rotation from Lucifers rotation.
Sirius B(and it’s magnetic field) is probably rotating so fast that Lucifers own movement is insignificant.
