OK, makes sense now - thanks for the clarification. TBH I don't think our answer lies in the overcharged FSD, but it doesn't hurt to try (everything).

That's the thing though. It doesn't actually charge your FSD. You get the message while you are so distant from the White Dwarf that the ejection cones aren't even visible. Its almost as though something other than the White Dwarf is prompting the message.
