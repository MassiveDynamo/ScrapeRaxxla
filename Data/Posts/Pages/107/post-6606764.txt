Hi all,

I am a long time lurker. Somehow is my first post here to,this thread.

Concerning MBs relation to Lovecraft.
I found an interesting comment from him on a book about Lovecrafts Cthulhu Myth.
Can be found here: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show?id=1822830318&tab=book

The Cthulhu Myth sounds quite interesting.

Info can be found here:

What do you guys think? Is there a possibility that Raxxla and the Cthulhu Mythos are connected?

It's an interesting question - I like the idea that if and when Raxxla is found, there's the possibility that FD could spin off some pretty wild sub-games into other galaxies/universes/dimensions where we are outside of the realm of our usual galaxy. That would be awesome.

Welcome to the forums too, long-time lurker!
