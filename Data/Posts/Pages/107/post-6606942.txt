I thought there were two types of messages:

1) FSD overcharged - when you scoop from a jet stream;
2) FSD operating over the safety limits - when you start heading out of a system in SC and keep going. I've had these when searching for bodies way out in (pretty much any) system.

Is that right? I get (2) when I head out. Perhaps we've all been getting our wires crossed. One point when I was scooping Sirius A I was pretty sure I got (2) - though it might have been (1) - this is what I am trying to replicate.

You get the "Frame shift drive operating beyond safety limits" audible message when traveling toward Sirius B from Sirius A. It happens when you are still a great distance from the White Dwarf. This could be linked to the description of the system found in the Gazetteer:

"Lucifer itself is an interesting planet. It orbits Sirius B very closely indeed, hence the enormous power the corporation can extract using the coils wrapped around the planet, and from their solar collector panels. Visitors should beware of the high radiation levels mainly from Sirius B, but also from the fuel plant."

Note: The high radiation levels may be typical for any white dwarf so the warning might simply be to those visiting Lucifer.
