From what I can see, Lucifer is 1:1 tidally locked.
The 99 days orbit period in system info, seem to be a typo.
I have bug reported it.

The dynamo stuff could still work, I guess?
From a point on Lucifer(stator) facing Sirius B(rotor), Sirius B will have it’s own rotation and the rotation from Lucifers rotation.
Sirius B(and it’s magnetic field) is probably rotating so fast that Lucifers own movement is insignificant.

I'll have to trust you on that one.
