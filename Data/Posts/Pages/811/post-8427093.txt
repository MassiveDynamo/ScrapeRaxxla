Hera/Hecate, Cassiopea - all checked couple hundreds pages ago. Problem with all those theories you do not have 3D orientation tools in game. At most you can fly in direction to some star inside system.
There is fraction Mother Gaia in Sol system I think.
And btw ... there is whole galaxy's sector Izanami - she was goddes of creation of everything in Japaneses myths.

So I would give up trying greek/rome/jap/etc there, as they're all mixed from all cultures. I even see russian old gods here.

However, there is key date there, 2192 or so in codex. I think that was initial type of predefined hyper routs. I.e. you couldn't jump to random star.
Also story about spiral stars. They're WRs, in real WRs can do "spirals" IF have another star in system close enough. It's reasearch from 2000 or so.
