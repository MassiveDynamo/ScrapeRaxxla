Greetings Commanders.

I found a strange bug. I was returning from a short exploration trip, parked in a nice quiet system and quit ED. Then I saw that I've earned a trophy called "What did you do?".
Eh? What did I do? Nothing, jumping around. Then I saw that what the trophy means "Got a bounty of 100000". What the..
I started ED again, but there was no bounty. Man, I thought that I've scanned a "forbidden" system
Now I'm way above the bubble and I still have no bounty but the trophy remains. Strange.

Maybe you should report this as a bug. What machine type are you on (PS/console)? EDSM badge award mechanism seems to be broken (I had a badge awarded about 6 months after the event, still not got Hutton Orbital visit badge even though Iâ€™ve been there many times). Dont know about console badges.
