Basicly Fdev Bruce Garrido says it would be a better idea in his opinion that the hunt for raxxla never ends. When you find it it will cause more question than answers, for example you find the door but dont know where the key is. they want the tinfoil loop keep going.

Yes, itâ€™s a good diversion from lack of lore & storyline!
