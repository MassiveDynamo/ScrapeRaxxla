That's Fdev fault tho. They have this wonderful sandbox they could have used to plant Easter eggs for folks to find. Hell even made it a normal gameplay loop. They didn't so now the disappointment leads to them. Especially if it's never found/not in the game.

There were things to look for/solve etc in the beginning (INRA bases, Dynasty Plot bases, barnacles, UA/UP etc etc, but salty people complained that the Canonn group solved everything before anybody else had a chance. So new interesting things seem to have been dropped (together with lore and galnet). Itâ€™s only TDW/Raxxla search that still has meaning.
