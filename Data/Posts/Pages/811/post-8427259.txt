Is it weird that I was just thinking this yesterday? that it would almost be a bummer if we found raxxla because then what would we look for?

That's Fdev fault tho. They have this wonderful sandbox they could have used to plant Easter eggs for folks to find. Hell even made it a normal gameplay loop. They didn't so now the disappointment leads to them. Especially if it's never found/not in the game.
