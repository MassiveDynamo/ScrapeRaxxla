Like, have you ever wondered why did the Mongols have advanced siege weapons? Because they had a need for them, no sense to build a siege engine when people in the next village are living in yurts. That's why the Greeks didn't build steam engines in the antiquity, the Chinese set gunpowder ablaze on a stick rather than into a gun barrel, or the Spanish were still rather searching for a trade route into East Asia even after discovering the Americas? It's like, all, like connected, man.

I thought the Greeks didn’t invent steam engines because they didn’t have coalfielfds
Or perhaps no kettles...
