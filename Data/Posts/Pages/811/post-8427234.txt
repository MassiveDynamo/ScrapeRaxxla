Has anyone tried encoding ''Raxxla'' in to same format as ''Shinrarta Dezhra''?
From wiki:
Shinrarta Dezhra's meaning was seemingly revealed in the novel Elite Dangerous: Premonition, written by Drew Wagar and released in 2017. According to the character Luko Giovanni, "Shinrarta Dezhra" means "Life, she saw, hope" in ancient Earth languages (Russian and Arabic). The name is further broken down in the text: Shinrarta Dezhra is the simplified form of Zhizn Ra'at Nadezhda, with zhizn meaning "life" in Russian, ra'at meaning "she saw" in Arabic, and nadezhda meaning "hope" in Russian.
Maybe we should try modding known interesting names in to that format and search them? This seem to be EPF ''secret'' language
