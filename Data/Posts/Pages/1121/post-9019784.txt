That's interesting.
The Dark Wheel novel was in the time of Elite1, and there were no ring stations. So the interpretation of the Dark Wheel as a station with a ring is already in the ED.
By the way, why stations have different shapes? I used to think it had to do with population size, level of technology, but it turns out that's not the case.
Elite 1 and the TDW novella play out exclusively in Galcop space. Galcop controlled all the stations in their space. They used only two models of stations. The Federation, the Empire and independent systems probably had other models, in the same period.
