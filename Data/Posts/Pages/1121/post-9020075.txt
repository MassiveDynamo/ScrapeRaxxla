Sign of the Elite ....
1. And why in the ED for the CQC also give this badge?
2. And the most unclear to me, I heard that the rank of Elite CQC gives access to a system in the main game ... Is it possible to play in the CQC alone (solo mode)?

Close Quarters Combat - so no its only v other players, thats the point, its quick PVP.

To get the Permit you have to get to level 50 and 'reset' back to level 1, long before Elite CQC luckily.
