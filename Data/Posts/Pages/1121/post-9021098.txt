Whats with Delphi?

No guts no glory...
Delphi the system in game (with that faction) was only fairly recently renamed from a proc-gen system. I believe it also now has a station called The Oracle IIRC.

The Omphalos Rift is mentioned in the Codex as part of the myth around Raxxla, being an alien artefact of some sort there. Omphalos is Ancient Greek, and was a religious object that marked the supposed center of the kingdom of the god Zeus, (it also means navel), and was kept at the temple of the Oracle of Delphi. Hence much of the speculation around ancient Greek mythology and Raxxla.
