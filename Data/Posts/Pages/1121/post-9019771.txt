There were a few of these, as well.
That's interesting.
The Dark Wheel novel was in the time of Elite1, and there were no ring stations. So the interpretation of the Dark Wheel as a station with a ring is already in the ED.
By the way, why stations have different shapes? I used to think it had to do with population size, level of technology, but it turns out that's not the case.
