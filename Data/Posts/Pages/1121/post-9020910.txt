No I got the info from other CQC players in other threads and in-game chatting. I've been there once in MC as well but kept my eyes shut to avoid spoilers lol I dont think theres a specific thread about it but theres a CQC forum, start there maybe or ask the question is best I can say. The system description just says Permit Available from CQC holdings iirc no specifics on how to get it. I originally found the system by accident just doing my usual check for Permit Locked in NavPanel and asked around as to how to get it, so dont know if its mentioned anywhere else.

As Mick says its called Prestige in CQC, I think the little symbols next to the player name in CQC waiting screen tell you what Prestige someone is or how many times they have reset from 50 to 1 but dunno what symbol means what or what the process to reset is, I assume its fairly obvious when you get to 50. Also resetting apparently speeds up or increases XP earned, think thats written somewhere in the CQC menu or waiting screen, maybe in tips in loading screen.

I havent checked Codex so not sure about that.

iirc the system has all the ships and modules at 10% discount or similar, so just like Jameson Memorial, but more exclusive than Shin Des as only one way to get the Permit and very small percentage of the playerbase has done it....or ever will probably. I'm 61% Semi-Pro and lvl 37 iirc so still some way to go. I checked on Inara a while back and it seemed to be that no-one below c10K kills in CQC had Elite rank, but checking recently its 20K so either they have upped the requirement, or as I hope, its just that those players have carried on and killed another 10K on top of required.

Sorry gone completely OT.
