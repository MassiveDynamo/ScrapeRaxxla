Speaking of CoR: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MPw1EzRmor2TvRw97QvB8lNTcBT2XffrMuMwEOAXaW8/edit
Solide piece of info gathering by CoR. It is however a bit strange that CoR are making a huge hypothesis based on Raxxla and Klaxian both containing an A and a X in the name.
This seem to be wishful thinking by someone who wants ‘The Alien World’ to be relevant. They go even further by equating all thargoids to the Oisir-Raxxlans. It's not clear why, but I guess they mean Oisir = Oresrian and Raxxlan = Klaxian?

John Jameson did not carry out the Mycoid attack in the 3250s. I don't see how they confused that one.
Other than that, the document is pretty good. CoR shines on the conspiracy stuff.
Their legend interpretations are however a bit weak.
