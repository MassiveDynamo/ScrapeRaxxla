As the fellow who re-introduced the topic of hyperspace spinning into this forum. I just want to clarify a few things:

(1) I notice a pronounced spin towards the end of jumps in and around the Horse Head Nebula;
(2) this does not occur anywhere else;
(3) I’ve noticed this phenomenon on two separate occasions months apart;
(4) both times, I was playing in solo mode with a wired high speed internet connection.

That said, I’m not convinced there is anything significant about this. Others have tried to re-create the spin I was seeing and were unable. Also, some folks have viewed my footage and said the spin looks totally normal to them. I’ve not seen that kind of spin elsewhere but who knows.

TLDR: hyperspace spin probably doesn’t equal “spiraling stars” hint.

Are you elite? Maybe only elitists get the spin?
