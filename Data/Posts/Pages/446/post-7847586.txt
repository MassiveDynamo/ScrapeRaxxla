It's taken a while but I've finally reached Phaa Chrie sector (in The Void). It was good fortune that I visited Star One first because going across the inter-arm gap required exactly the same level of fuel management and almost jump-by-jump plotting, though the star density is slightly higher here than out on the rim and my longest jump was 84.73LY (requiring a standard FSD boost given my ship's jump range).

This sector is right at the end of the Sagittarius-Carina Arm. If anyone did want to hide anything out of the way in this part of the galaxy, then this might be the sort of place that they would choose. Unless something really important comes up (that I can reach in time) then I plan to spend maybe a month or so out here to see if anything calls to me, as in 'siren of the deepest void'.

If I get a bad case of space madness, I might head home sooner. I've been out since just after the April Update dropped already.
