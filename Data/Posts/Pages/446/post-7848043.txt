I'm not elite but I get the spins near nebulae. I'm not trying to imply raxxla relation specifically, just that I think it's more than loading screen lag type stuff

Well there's definitely an aspect of loading screen lag to it. When I was downloading an update to Steam tonight, there was much more hyperspace spin while my bandwidth was being shared, than when it was just ED using it.
