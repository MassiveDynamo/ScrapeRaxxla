Ok. Distances from sun. 1st vid - aprox 1071 kLs, 2nd vid - unclear, 3rd vid - unclear, 4th vid - 1501 kLs, 5th vid - 924 kLs, 6th vid - unclear, 7th vid - unclear, 8th - unclear, 9th - unclear, 10th - unclear.

Even with those numbers, on one instance the green glow appeared outside those numbers. We need to know if the glow can appear even outside belt limits, or if it's belt-only.
I pointed out about 10 posts ago that the first video taken by Spliffz is about the strongest I've seen the glow. he was only about 1100 ls from Sol, heading away from Sol towards Jupiter, & quite a way above the plane of the belt. So yes, outside the belt! (Unless itâ€™s much thicker in-game than IRL?)
