I could only see something useful in CMDR Falconscreech's vid, it said 924 kLs from Sol. Asteroid belt is 1.1 - 1.6 kLs (my calculations, not FD's). Could be the closest belt limit, don't know exactly where FD put it in-game.
When checking for the green-glow source, it might be useful to have Sol selected in order to get an accurate distance reading, so other cmdrs might use it to try to replicate.

edit: typos
The main asteroid belt has inner radius 1027 ls from Sol outer radius is 1631 ls, so middle is 1327 ls.
If you want to see the asteroid cluster symbol shown in the hud then you mustn’t have anything selected. It’s easy enough with a headtracker to keep glancing over at Sol to check the distance, or a quick look in the nav panel if Sol is at the top of the list.
