Heres a good one,
Has anyone put their head cam into free view on green glow experience, and tried to look INSIDE your cockpit, behind your chair?
Like in VR, you can see the enitre inside of the pit, ect....

What about with a multi-crew person watching for the glow inside and outside?

Im curious if somthing INSIDE our ships themselves is creating the glow.....
