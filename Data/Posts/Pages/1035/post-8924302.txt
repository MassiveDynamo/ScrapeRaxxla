Ya i like this - honestly i think ive seen the green flash in the past but cant for the life of me remember the situation. I think later this eve or so I will go find a place in a different system where alot of signal sources pop up and see if i can recreate it there. I am thinking the flash is associated with a signal source popping up close to you ... or something like that. Or maybe its the coffee machine letting you know its ready...

Mmm, I’m not coming round to yours for coffee and biccies if your coffee glows green!
