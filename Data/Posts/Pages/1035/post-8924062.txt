Unfortunately I haven't had time to watch them all and look for patterns, hopefully this is useful to someone.

I could only see something useful in CMDR Falconscreech's vid, it said 924 kLs from Sol. Asteroid belt is 1.1 - 1.6 kLs (my calculations, not FD's). Could be the closest belt limit, don't know exactly where FD put it in-game.
When checking for the green-glow source, it might be useful to have Sol selected in order to get an accurate distance reading, so other cmdrs might use it to try to replicate.
