The main asteroid belt has inner radius 1027 ls from Sol outer radius is 1631 ls, so middle is 1327 ls.
If you want to see the asteroid cluster symbol shown in the hud then you mustn’t have anything selected. It’s easy enough with a headtracker to keep glancing over at Sol to check the distance, or a quick look in the nav panel if Sol is at the top of the list.
I’ve been checking a few asteroid belts, on my slow return to the bubble. One thing I have noticed, is that clusters are often way of the plane in the orrery map.

Only about 50 jumps to Sol. I might get there soon.
