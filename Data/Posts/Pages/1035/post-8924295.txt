yelboc said he has seen it at Titan station and no one noticed his message

Ya i like this - honestly i think ive seen the green flash in the past but cant for the life of me remember the situation. I think later this eve or so I will go find a place in a different system where alot of signal sources pop up and see if i can recreate it there. I am thinking the flash is associated with a signal source popping up close to you ... or something like that. Or maybe its the coffee machine letting you know its ready...
