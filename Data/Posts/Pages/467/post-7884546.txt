I'm not making any assertions either way, just pointing out that we actually have no confirmation that Raxxla exists as something in game. I think that, should Raxxla fail to exist as a physical entity in game, there would be no lies on part of FD at this point.
How can you say that, after seeing the clip above? "What a silly question! Of course it exists!" If it doesn't exist in game - how could that not be interpreted as a lie? Given that the conversation/whole live stream was about Elite Dangerous.
