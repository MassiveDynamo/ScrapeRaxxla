Hmmmm. Should we believe FDev statements, or the alleged friend of an alleged employee (a pretty junior one) Odd there is nothing there that isnt already widely rumoured.

DB's statement to Drew Wagar trumps that info. R's location is not known by many even in FD, so likely even if he said it,that said employee is ignorant of the true situation. Please see the facts on the first page of this thread - its existence is one of the few that we have.. don't believe the nay-sayers - follow the gourd - the dream..

The DW havent found R, is we take the Codex as fact - 'it is their principal aim' not 'was'. But they are likely to have some clues or other data not currently published, presumably based on Jason Ryder's research before his demise and anything else learnt since then. So in term of story arc., finding them may well unlock a 'next phase'.


We actually don't have any confirmation that Raxxla is something that exists in game. DW originally quoted DB as saying "it exists, we know where it is and why it hasn't been found" but for some reason changed this statement to read "it's out there, and we know where it is" in later publications of this info. Neither of these statements imply that raxxla exists in game.

Edit: i confronted DW about this discrepancy a few months ago. I was frustrated with his response so never followed up, but you can check it out here: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/lore-questions.459433/post-7825684
In my opinion, this is essential information for our search, but i fear it is already lost to time and obfuscation.
