Remember, Drew is not FDev, so with complete respect to Drew, this has always been a second hand statement. (Which I entirely believe, for the record, regardless of the exact semantics of the wording). When I talk of official statements, I am referring more to David Braben saying himself that it exists....

Yes, I know he didn't say the words "in Elite Dangerous" - but the context was clear enough, that if it isnt in the game, then I would regard this statement as a blatant lie. I simply cant imagine that DB (The CEO of a PLC and an OBE) would blatantly lie about it, so, for me, this snippet is concrete assurance that Raxxla IS in the game.

I'm not making any assertions either way, just pointing out that we actually have no confirmation that Raxxla exists as something in game. I think that, should Raxxla fail to exist as a physical entity in game, there would be no lies on part of FD at this point.
