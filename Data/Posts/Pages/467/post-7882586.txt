DB's statement to Drew Wagar trumps that info. R's location is not known by many even in FD, so likely even if he said it,that said employee is ignorant of the true situation. Please see the facts on the first page of this thread - its existence is one of the few that we have.. don't believe the nay-sayers - follow the gourd - the dream..

The DW havent found R, is we take the Codex as fact - 'it is their principal aim' not 'was'. But they are likely to have some clues or other data not currently published, presumably based on Jason Ryder's research before his demise and anything else learnt since then. So in term of story arc., finding them may well unlock a 'next phase'.
