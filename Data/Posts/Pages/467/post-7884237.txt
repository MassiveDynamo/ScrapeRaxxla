We actually don't have any confirmation that Raxxla is something that exists in game. DW originally quoted DB as saying "it exists, we know where it is and why it hasn't been found" but for some reason changed this statement to read "it's out there, and we know where it is" in later publications of this info. Neither of these statements imply that raxxla exists in game.

Edit: i confronted DW about this discrepancy a few months ago. I was frustrated with his response so never followed up, but you can check it out here: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/lore-questions.459433/post-7825684
In my opinion, this is essential information for our search, but i fear it is already lost to time and obfuscation.
Remember, Drew is not FDev, so with complete respect to Drew, this has always been a second hand statement. (Which I entirely believe, for the record, regardless of the exact semantics of the wording). When I talk of official statements, I am referring more to David Braben saying himself that it exists....

Yes, I know he didn't say the words "in Elite Dangerous" - but the context was clear enough, that if it isnt in the game, then I would regard this statement as a blatant lie. I simply cant imagine that DB (The CEO of a PLC and an OBE) would blatantly lie about it, so, for me, this snippet is concrete assurance that Raxxla IS in the game.
