I've seen the clip many times - never without seeing some ensuing argument about how DB's words, which you've misquoted, ought to be interpreted.

Raxxla can exist without being a physical entity in game - as an idea, for instance.

Edit: DB either says "What a silly question! Of Course!" Or "what a silly question, of course". He could be saying "of course people want to ask that question", but i am with you that he was indeed confirming Raxxla's existence with "of course". I also think he was referring back to this question when he later states "you don't know what it is, though". But alas, this bit of conversation has proven a bit too convoluted to really be useful for the community.
