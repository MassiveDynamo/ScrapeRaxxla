I've seen the clip many times - never without seeing some ensuing argument about how DB's words, which you've misquoted, ought to be interpreted.

Raxxla can exist without being a physical entity in game - as an idea, for instance.

Edit: DB either says "What a silly question! Of Course!" Or "what a silly question, of course". He could be saying "of course people want to ask that question", but i am with you that he was indeed confirming Raxxla's existence with "of course". I also think he was referring back to this question when he later states "you don't know what it is, though". But alas, this bit of conversation has proven a bit too convoluted to really be useful for the community.
Well, if it isnt in the game, I'm sure Hillary Clinton would say he simply "mis-spoke", but for me, it's a clear statement, from the CEO that's it's in the game. Since your follow-up, I have watched it several more times, and just cant get any other interpretation.

The comment about not knowing what it is, yes I agree that is not clear enough to be taken in either possible context, although on the 3rd or 4th time I listened, I swayed towards him meaning we don't know what Raxxla is, just by the way his pitch increased.

And I'm sorry if I misquoted. Certainly not intentional, whilst in a debate about people missquoting!
