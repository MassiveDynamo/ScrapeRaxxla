Nice idea but the dark wheel, from what I know, does t know where raxxla is and is trying to find it them selves. But it could be a start, usually tho you get them from mysterious stranger tip off missions
It was an example of how the mechanism could work, rather than a theory

Having said that, however, some think unlocking DW is pre-req to unlocking Raxxla. Makes sense, maybe, that DW find it JIT, if we unlock them.

For example - we unlock DW. We find out we unlocked them by getting a tip off, which leads us to their station. We then get a regular mission (or further tip off mission) telling us they think they have found "you know what", can we go check it out, oh, and here's an encryption key you might need.....
