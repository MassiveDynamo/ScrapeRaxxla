No sweat, we're on the same page and mostly agree on the interpretations of DB's statements. I'm just playing devil's advocate so we don't get too far ahead of ourselves if there is other possible interpretation.

The only reason i brought this all up is because you and others had brought up Raxxla confirmations in response to the leak's "no Raxxla" statement. Raxxla could indeed exist but not expressly be in the game. "There is no Raxxla in Elite" is a loaded statement in itself. There could be scenarios in which Raxxla is technically in Elite, but this art designer would not be "lying" in the traditional sense to say it does not - if Raxxla is some sort of information, for example. Or perhaps Raxxla exists as something uninteresting for players, such as a barren planet surrounded by false rumor. In that sense, would someone be lying if they claimed Raxxla didn't exist?

Im totally with your interpretations of confirmations so far, but we have to admit that they are pretty open to interpretation, and that this leaker has much more established credit than FD at the moment.
