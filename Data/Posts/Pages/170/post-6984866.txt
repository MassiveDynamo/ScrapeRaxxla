Bovomit is at ~(-20000,0,-7000) while Colonia is at ~(-9500,-1000,20000) - so it's further away from Colonia than it is from Sol. I don't see why Jaques moving would cause a rethink of what to use Bovomit for.

The whole Orion-Col70-Cone permit cluster went in with 2.1, a month before Jaques jumped or the UAs were delivered, too.

Bovomit's direction certainly would fit with a "between Pleiades and Polaris" FFE-compatible understanding of the direction of Thargoid space, though.

no you misunderstand me. I don’t think Jaques’ misjump was the cause of the redesign, but another product of it. I don’t have any idea what caused the redesign, but it does seem that previous plans were reformed, e.g. the locking of Col70 et al which were previously accessible and partially explored.
