Raxxla might well tur out to be Guardian in some form, but I kind of doubt it's the homeworld.

From the few descriptions we have, Raxxla isn't anything special. It's the gateway(alien construct) that makes it valuable.

Rafe Zetter's words are: "on Raxxla there's an alien construct that's a gateway to other Universes, and all that's in those Universes in the way of bounty, and treasures, and aliens, and lifeâ€¦"

and: "We've long suspected that a corps of Elites lives there, and are exploiting the gateway."

Both sentences points to the importance of the gateway. The planet could be any dull rock.

The question is who would build such a gateway?
- I don't think the religious traditionalist Guardians on the home world would.
- The colonists from the three slower than light Ark ships probably didn't get very far. I guess they were re-assimilated with the rest of the Guardians, as soon as FTL travel was available.
- The exiles the group of Guardians that had adopted implants to utilize sentient AI, is a decent candidate. There are no records of where they went and they would have the motivation to move far away. They were also probably the most advanced 'meat creatures' this galaxy have seen.
- The constructs. The Guardian AI that destroyed their own creators. These would have lived on in the monolit-network and in all the sentient machines. How they have developed later, is unknown. They may have found new 'meat hosts', they may have joined the exiles or found entirely new ways to maintain their existence.

I thought that the ftl drive details were sent to the Ark ships, though my memory may be faulty.

I suspect the power behind the PF are Guardian-related, maybe the AI... we shall see (in about 6 years time)
