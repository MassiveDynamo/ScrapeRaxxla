I would like to think that we would find some alien structure that instantly allows us access to anywhere in the galaxy e.g. Beagles point, but I think all we may find is a rock called Raxxla.

Oh I think there will be something there,
possibly the permit to open up Bovomit Sector which is, I suspect,where FD have put the Guardian AI. I suspect Bovomit was originally going to be the Thargoid area of space but FD seem to have had a redesign sometime around Jaqueâ€™s misjump and they moved the goids in the Col70 direction.

edit: actually, if that hypothesis is true then it might make sense for Raxxla to lie out in that direction after all; I do think Raxxla will turn out to be the Guardian homeworld....
