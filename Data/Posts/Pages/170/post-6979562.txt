I thought you were signed up for the Autumn Odyssey expedition, doesn’t that depart this weekend?

Right, I was. Untill this opportunity of enjoying a fore-taste of the Armageddon of Humanity jumped in ! For science !

since there is only one galaxy implemented in ED then Raxxla cannot hold ”alien construct that’s a gateway to other Universes, and all that’s in those Universes in the way of bounty, and treasures, and aliens, and life.” So I suspect it may hold a means to unlock some currently permit-locked area of this galaxy.

Since 95% of the nature of our Universe is unknown (99.99% in the Newtonian ED where even light is faster than light), Raxxla could pretty well open us a new Universe inside our Universe or a new MW inside the MW... Just needs some imagination and creativity, major flaw of FD. Some lore says Thargs live in "witch-space" iirc... And, actually, the "hyperdiction" concept leads that way. Would be cool Raxxla allowing us to hyperdict !

***ing Gauss guns ! I swear to myself never to grind again ! (...again )
