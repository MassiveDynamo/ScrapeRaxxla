Hi, I've read the first posts and didn't found reference to it, so I've got a question: I've seen references in reddit about some FDev statement saying that someone had jumped into the system containing Raxxla, didn't notice it and jumped away. Is this true?.

It's a forum/reddit myth. That statement has never been backed by a source.
