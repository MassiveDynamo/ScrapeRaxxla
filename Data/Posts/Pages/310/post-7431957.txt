All I found was a part of me that was missing. An out of touch part of myself that I've not seen in a long while. Something I had been searching for for years now.. And it's been an empowering experience on many levels. It has done away with years of depression and all the behaviors that come along with it. I discovered something much more than a planet or a flight through Maia B to Andromeda. I did not want Raxxla to be a journey. I wanted Andromeda, and who knows, maybe it too exists. But I found something that opened a part of me that needed to open. Something I had yearned for on a truly deep level.
It served as my own hammer to knock down My Wall.
I discovered my own personal Kora and stand here now with an upright spine and a smile.
I feel happy. I feel different. I feel better. I cannot imagine anything more powerful to discover.

No I was not able to reproduce the Hades incident. It may have been a bug. Time will tell.
Careful who you follow my friends. Always use critical thinking. Leave your mind open to possibilities.

Fly Safe.
