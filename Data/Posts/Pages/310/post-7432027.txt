What if that's the point, there isn't a "THE" Raxxla.
What if, the "personal journey" comment from a while back, means each CMDR follows their own quest and finds something they can call Raxxla.
(bit of a stretch, but there is a lot of scope in the game)

Then it's dumb...and completely uninteresting.

"Oi, pal! I found Raxxla!"

"Oh yeah? What'd you do?"

"Delivered two tonnes of bio waste in me sidey to Hutton Orbital."

"Wot?! That's it? Not much in it is it?"

"Yeah, m8, but it's like, a journey, man."
