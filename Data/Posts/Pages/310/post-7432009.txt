Eh, to each CMDR according to his own tastes, I suppose.

I'll continue on searching for THE Raxxla.

Yeah... Well, as I asked many times, "what is" Raxxla in ED ? Is it the "RH's Raxxla" ? Is it some kind of "Oolite Raxxla" ? Is it the E/F missions "The Myth" ?
The Codex, only canon, doesn't give much.
