Ah gotcha. The DW missions that went missing a while back. Thanks if they do come back that would be interesting. If not I wonder if that’s what Farseer was talking about.

ah, but DW in SD are still in business therefore, according to Felicity, they must be the real deal; but not necessarily anywhere near the inner circle -they’re just “spinning on the outer rim”! (Elite Premonition)

actually maybe they want thrumpberry juice deliveries!
