Well... I wouldn't be surprised if so.

Once there was a myth, a legend, but corrobored by many testimonials.
This myth was a major subject of conversation in most station bars across the Bubble for decades.
Unobedient kids were usually threatened to be sent there.
Space ships were disappearing when cruising a certain region of the MW...
A Bermuda Triangle of sorts ! There be Dragons ! There be Ghosts ! There be Sirens !
Terrifying !

Well, this mYsTeRy turned out to be one very human stranded ship and the only ghosts you can find there are those of the dead very human crew !

Booo !
