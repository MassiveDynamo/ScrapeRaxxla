Terra, usually means specifically "Earth".
The Guernica usually represents a bombardment (even if it was originally meant to represent a famous Spanish Torero's death dismay and created before that bombardment took place).
The circles, yes, two planets facing one another, with an old man inbetween or, focusing on the shape between them, a wormhole of sorts.
Tin foil roll out...

Let's keep open-minded: he found "his" Raxxla.
Lucky guy !
