Who thinks the E/F missions are back ?
I think these are just trade beacons. Kinda like the old T9s that wanted you to drop a certain cargo item. Now they have you deliver the item to a station.

On a side note they really should show up as something other than mission uss as that is kinda confusing. Having it say Trade Beacon detected would be much clearer, and less confusing than how it is now.
