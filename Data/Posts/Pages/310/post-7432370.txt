Anthony Newley, 6 episodes, very surreal and fun and out on DVD. Braben has good taste!

My grandfather was a miner there. Before all the murders

It is quite hard to believe that whole area was a mining region now. I knew of people who were miners in Peasedown St. John;a hard and tough life, for sure!
