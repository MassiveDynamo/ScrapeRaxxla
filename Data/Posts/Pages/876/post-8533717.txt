re: DSS/FSS how does something like Voyager resolve now?
As it used to be only seeable when within 2000Ls, which was kinda tricky even with a direction and distance, and impossible without. I've always thought Raxxla / DW station could be hidden like that (or the comets which presumably still dont show).
Don't quote me on this, as I've not checked on it for quite some time, but my understanding was that the Voyager probes show up in the FSS, but Gen Ships will only show up if they're near a planet, and if not they still have to be found by getting within 1,000 ls.

I don't think I ever checked that Gen Ship situation myself, so heard it 2nd hand, but IIRC correctly it was a reasonably reliable source. It could have all changed since then anyway.

I'm too far away, but if anyone's in the bubble, it'd be a good thing to check.

Places which people can go and FSS and report back findings:

Lalande
Alaunus
Coelachi
Hermitage
