errr for LFT 509? It's permit locked, so how do i honk it from the next system over?
It was an answer about Voyager, sorry.
re: DSS/FSS how does something like Voyager resolve now?
As it used to be only seeable when within 2000Ls, which was kinda tricky even with a direction and distance, and impossible without. I've always thought Raxxla / DW station could be hidden like that (or the comets which presumably still dont show).
