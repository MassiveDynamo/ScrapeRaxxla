I just noticed another odd thing in CD-58 16
When I looked at the star from the planets in FSS mode, I noticed another orbital line around star that is at 90 degrees to the planetary plane!

SPOILER: SCREENSHOT
I see it only in FSS but not in supercruise.

I think in this case the planetary plane is wrong because that's the orbit path of the only planet in the system. Bit strange though.
