Don't quote me on this, as I've not checked on it for quite some time, but my understanding was that the Voyager probes show up in the FSS, but Gen Ships will only show up if they're near a planet, and if not they still have to be found by getting within 1,000 ls.

I don't think I ever checked that Gen Ship situation myself, so heard it 2nd hand, but IIRC correctly it was a reasonably reliable source. It could have all changed since then anyway.

I'm too far away, but if anyone's in the bubble, it'd be a good thing to check.

I've been visiting the ancient probes in Sol system this weekend and all 3 show in the FSS.

Why do you think GenShips would be in those systems?
