I deleted my old bookmark of LFT 509 yesturday and recreated it. Had no disconnects. I had no disconnects at all after patch btw, contrary to many people. Do you have open port for Elite or you go on auto network settings?
Maybe Frontier tries to shut us out from this mystery at this time?

I only get disconnects when I try and bookmark it from in the cockpit, works fine in the galaxy map. And I couldn't tell you about the network settings, can't find that setting in game. This is the only time I've had a disconnect. I won't rant about "Unknown Permits" where they lock parts of the galaxy off for future expansions because now we know stuff is there, I just hope that this LFT 509 permit is obtainable in some way and not just there because the devs haven't put anything there yet..
