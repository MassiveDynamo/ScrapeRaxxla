I wonder if there are any sectors or systems which are anagrams of raxxla.

System codes only allow us 4 letters due to the format of AA-A An-n

Remove duplicate letters from raxxla though and we get 4. raxl.

Could there be a system called something like Xarxal AX-R L1-10? Don't think so from what i remember of system naming conventions.

Not sure how helpful this could be:

It's possible to have something like: Drya Pra XX-L A19-84, I guess.
