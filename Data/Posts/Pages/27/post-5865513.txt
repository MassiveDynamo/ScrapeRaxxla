I thought that might be the case. So basically all we know about Raxxla is it exists and it's in-game. Do we really know it has a gateway to other universes? That was in Oolite and Dark Wheel, but wasn't the latter also retconned?

I must say I find this retconning extremely confusing!

The Dark Wheel novella isn't considered canon in the Elite: Dangerous universe. I don't even think it was canon when Frontier: Elite 2 or Frontier: First Encounters came out.

That said, there are elements from The Dark Wheel that have been confirmed as canon. Foremost of these, considering this thread, is the legend of Raxxla. And Here The Wheel by John Harper confirms that there was someone named Alex Ryder who became the leader of an organization known as "The Dark Wheel" and that they were determined to find the legendary planet of Raxxla.

Drew Wagar's recently released novel Premonition confirms that Alex Ryder's companion, Elyssia Fields, from The Dark Wheel novella also existed and seems to hint at a connection between Fields, Ryder and "The Dark Wheel".

The Dark Wheel novella also introduced a Thargoid-like species known as the Oresrians ... a species confirmed to be canon in T. James' novel Out Of The Darkness and further expanded upon in Wagar's Premonition.

Beyond these simple facts I don't think anything else from The Dark Wheel novella has been confirmed as canon. Therefore the description of Raxxla given by Rafe Zetter (we don't know if Rafe is canon) is all hearsay but we really have very little else to go on.
