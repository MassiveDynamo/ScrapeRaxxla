I thought that might be the case. So basically all we know about Raxxla is it exists and it's in-game. Do we really know it has a gateway to other universes? That was in Oolite and Dark Wheel, but wasn't the latter also retconned?

I must say I find this retconning extremely confusing!

The Dark Wheel wasn't part of the retcon. It has been 'Mythology' since the release of FE2. The people in The Dark Wheel are real though. The Ryders and Elyssia Fields are confirmed by the new lore. I think we can view The Dark Wheel as a 'based on real events' story.

Everything The Dark Wheel tells us about Raxxla, comes from Rafe Zetter. He knows only the legend of Raxxla, but he takes Jason's last words as confirmation.

Jason found evidence for the real existence of Raxxla. He was about to start the search, when he was killed. Jason never actually found Raxxla. That also means that The Dark Wheel(organisation) did not find it, as Jason was supposed to lead them.

Alex and Elyssia will have been searching for Raxxla, probably on behalf of The Dark Wheel. They may have found it, but I'm not sure. There are both Ryders and Elyssia clones? in 3303. They may worth keeping an eye on.

When it comes to location, I think our best hint is 'obfuscated in the outer rim'.

This could mean the rim of the galaxy, the human bubble or a specific system. I doesn't tell much about where Raxxla is, but it tells us a bit about where it isn't located. It's not on a known central world.
