When it comes to location, I think our best hint is 'obfuscated in the outer rim'.

This could mean the rim of the galaxy, the human bubble or a specific system. I doesn't tell much about where Raxxla is, but it tells us a bit about where it isn't located. It's not on a known central world.

I wonder if there are any sectors or systems which are anagrams of raxxla.

System codes only allow us 4 letters due to the format of AA-A An-n

Remove duplicate letters from raxxla though and we get 4. raxl.

Could there be a system called something like Xarxal AX-R L1-10? Don't think so from what i remember of system naming conventions.

Not sure how helpful this could be: https://cim.sotl.org.uk/elite-dangerous/
