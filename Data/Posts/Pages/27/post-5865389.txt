What exactly are we looking for?

We assume that Raxxla is somewhere within fairly easy reach of the Bubble, right? I mean ... Jason Ryder apparently discovered it's location way back around the year 3100 when space travel still required the use of the Faraway jump system to travel between the stars. Witchspace was crowded with monitoring satellites, branch lines, stop points, and rescue stations (according to The Dark Wheel novella). Jumping on your own to a system that wasn't a part of the Faraway system was fraught with danger.

Raxxla, therefore, is quite likely in humanity's own backyard.












As I see it there is nothing to exclude it, nor to support it (because that would require a clue, which DB has said we ain't going to get). Also Raxla in (possibly now discounted) lore was a wandering planet, so it could have moved since 3301 and be anywhere.
