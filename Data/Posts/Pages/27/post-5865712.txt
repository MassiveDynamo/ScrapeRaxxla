I don't think that there is any evidence that Alex Ryder was ever cloned. Elyssia though ... definitely. We know that Salomé was a clone and that she was a genetic match of Octavia Quenton. While it is possible that Octavia and Salomé come from the same genetic source as Elyssia I don't think Premonition goes far enough to make that a certainty.

Alex ... we know that Alex led The Dark Wheel and had two sons: Neptune and Oberon Ryder. Oberon got tired of the search for Raxxla and gave it up in favor of finding Soontill. Oberon split from The Dark Wheel and he and the pilots who followed him banded together to form The Circle of Independent Elite Pilots. Oberon's son Jordan tried to leave CIEP and keep his own son, Robert, from being discovered by them since they had a habit of placing a descendant of the Ryder family in the role of leader.

I *think* that Oberon and Neptune are the result of a union between Alex and Elyssia. The only evidence is that the two boys were given whimsical names pulled from mythological sources (Elyssia's brood mother was fascinated with mythology).

The only prominent "Ryder" in the galaxy (that I know of) is Liz Ryder, the Engineer. Worth keeping an eye on her.

It was just poor wording. I don't think Alex was cloned.

I was thinking of Neptun, Oberon and Liz.
Pluss we have Ryder's Revolutionary Party, in Maia. I always found that name a bit suspicious.
