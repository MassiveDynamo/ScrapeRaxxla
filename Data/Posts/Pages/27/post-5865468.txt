I believe that the "wandering planet" mythos of Raxxla goes back to Drew Wagar's Oolite Saga and no further. If so then Raxxla's "mobility" is entirely a work of fan fiction and not, therefore, canon.

I thought that might be the case. So basically all we know about Raxxla is it exists and it's in-game. Do we really know it has a gateway to other universes? That was in Oolite and Dark Wheel, but wasn't the latter also retconned?

I must say I find this retconning extremely confusing!
