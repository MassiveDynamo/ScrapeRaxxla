Yes... Because Zombie Commanders are creepy. (Holdstock died in 2008. If he's flying about in the Elite galaxy then Thargoids are the least of our problems).


Yeah, this is what I was getting at Zombie CMDR's would definitely be a tad creepy!

Was it 2008 or 2009 though? For some reason i thought he passed away in 2009...
