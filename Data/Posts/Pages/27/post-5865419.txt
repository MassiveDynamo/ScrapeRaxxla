Jorki Rasalas said:
As I see it there is nothing to exclude it, nor to support it (because that would require a clue, which DB has said we ain't going to get). Also Raxla in (possibly now discounted) lore was a wandering planet, so it could have moved since 3301 and be anywhere.

I believe that the "wandering planet" mythos of Raxxla goes back to Drew Wagar's Oolite Saga and no further. If so then Raxxla's "mobility" is entirely a work of fan fiction and not, therefore, canon.
