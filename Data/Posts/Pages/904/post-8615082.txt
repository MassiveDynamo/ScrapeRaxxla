Agree. We still have to do the 'journey', whatever that means.
Perhaps by then it may spawn in for the person who did the journey.

Same kind of process perhaps offered by the initial missions back in 2015, but it can be different mechanics this time around.
There's a flurry of possible combinations to measure 'progress' or a 'journey'.

Events, triggers, something we do over time - or within a specific timeslot. For example within 30 days before your inbox expires. Or not.
At the correct location(s), having visited the correct POIs (in a wider term, station, place, mission you name it). Aka 'Turning The wheel' may very well be required to get TDW or someone else in the proper location.
Having the correct status / reputation. Positive and/or negative.
Either performed in order, or perhaps not required to do so.

Then you may get an invitation, or a mission, or a offer for a permission.
Or perhaps you'll get no indication whatsoever.
Perhaps it's perma-permit locked until FDev decides to activate the chain of events again.

At least I'm confident of one thing: It's not going to pop up in space just because you happened to fly there.
