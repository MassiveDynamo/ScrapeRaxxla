Becoming Elite seem to be one of the requirements for the journey.
Are you saying you need to be in the Starter-bubble and reach Elite ranking while staying there? Oh darn, we all have to reset out accounts ... fun times ahead

I suspect being Elite is a requirement that was retconned out ( though just in case I made the push to get my triple in April and am still suffering the consequent RSI in my wrist). It isn’t mentioned in the Codex, the only authoritative lore source we have now (apart from tourist beacons, & I’m a bit dubious about some of those); it originated in Holdstock’s original novella.
