Let's hope Raxxla isn't in the Newb's Permit Locked starting systems.

Maybe it is "in game" but it is only somewhere in those Training Sims that you can do. ... you have to venture off the path described in the training.

Just thinking out loud. No real insight or anything... just tying what comes to mind.
Becoming Elite seem to be one of the requirements for the journey.
Are you saying you need to be in the Starter-bubble and reach Elite ranking while staying there? Oh darn, we all have to reset out accounts ... fun times ahead
