Contradictory as in 'its a place you can find right now, just by flying there'?
Because that's the only thing I excluded in my post

Yep, I think it’s there to be found and not permit-locked, but the correct trigger is needed to activate it.
That’s what I need to test.
Of course, I have been wrong on one or two (mmm, maybe thirty over the last few years) previous theories

Actually, since I haven’t tested it yet it is really just a hypothesis
Or an idea
Maybe a hope?
Doh, I’ve got myself all depressed now
