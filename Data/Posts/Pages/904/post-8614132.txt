And back on track but the same question.

When did the legend of Raxxla start, first mention is apparently 2296 as a fake news treasure, where are the other sources in the Codex that 'all agree its a real place'? What are they?

I mean you couldn't be more vague, Ive never even seen any Raxxla fluff in game and there could be lots of fluff that just confirms what we already know, that nobody knows anything and its all guesswork and rumour?

But 'they' are trying to hide the 'when' because that is or may be a major clue as to the source of the story. So 'when' may be important, or more significant than we know....whatever that means.

Edit: Oh lord Im off to Tau Ceti again arent !?
