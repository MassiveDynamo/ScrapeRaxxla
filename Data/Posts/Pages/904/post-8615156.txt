Mmm, I have a contradictory theory, which I’ve been trying to get time to test for the past week. Grandchildren’s activity centre construction has prevented my flying. Spent 6 hours in the pouring rain yesterday digging holes to concrete in the ground anchors, and I’m shattered. Now I’ll have to supervise the little horrors sweeties for the next few days. Might get back to Questing by Wednesday, if I’m lucky, and my nerves are in a fit state.
Else I’ll be tanked out on the (medicinal) brandy!
Contradictory as in 'its a place you can find right now, just by flying there'?
Because that's the only thing I excluded in my post
