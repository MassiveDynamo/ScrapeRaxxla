It was supposedly said at a public Q&A in the original version, it may have changed after the public didnt come forward to back it up.

Almost impossible? Like organising the fuel rats, or travelling to Salome Reach, or finding one megaship in the 400bn systems, or cracking those codes like Canonn did, or Distant Worlds or DW2 or creating EDDB, Coriolis, EDSM and a million other things that this community has achieved..

No, if it was believed at the time by the people who heard it, it would have led to mass expeditions and a lot of publicity. There is zero contemporary evidence or witness statement. It all started much later, would be nice to find the first person who posted it however on here or on Reddit, just to see what the context is.
