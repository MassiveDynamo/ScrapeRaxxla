Apologies if I posted this before. I feel it may need to be said again based on previous remarks.
In regards to Persephone/Cora.
In the Dark Wheel Novella, Jason Ryder's ship is the Avalonia. Avalon (An island in myth) system containing the the Persephone station.
Worth noting is the Noctilux station in Avalon. Noctilux is a very expensive camera lens made by Leica Cameras. Think of the Alice looking through the looking glass.
Persephone in Sol. Turns out this was the hypothesized 9th planet in our real history, but in Elite, this was found and named Persephone.
Persephone, aka Kore, aka Kora as proven in wiki and in the Persephone system with the sole ELW Kore.
Persephone was used in the Rift mysteries by Drew.
She was also used in one of those past treasure hunts by that mysterious billionaire Alfred Jeffress
She's now found in the codex under the name Cora.
She is the constant figure from the beginning to current.
There is a strong reason why that is. The question is, Why?

SPOILER: I NEED A DIRTY WOMAN. I NEED A DIRTY GIRL.
