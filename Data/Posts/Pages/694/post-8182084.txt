How is word "Raxxla" pronounced in English? I asking this question because Google have translated (some times) it to my language as "Rakshla" so very similar to Rakshasa.
I believe Vet is right that’s it’s Racks-lah. But I’ve been pronouncing it Rocks-lah, for years before I heard it pronounced properly from the creators. I’m sticking with my way tho I like it better
