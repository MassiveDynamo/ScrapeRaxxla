Cor this thread has taken a funny turn down a dark lane...loving it

I have a mental image of David Braben banging his head on the desk reading this thread and saying 'For Gods sake people, just fly 20m LS straight up from Lave 2 towards Diso 5C, its bleedin obvious!'

The CQC Trigger debate for me is more about access/invitation to the DW rather than Raxxla and yes I am working on it just in case (as you say, its only logical) but it doesn't stop me trying other things in the meantime as well.

Journey - imo deliberately chosen to be ambiguous, just like the Codex entries. But if its a physical entity in a fixed place then the easiest version is its just a physical journey for each player. Its the 'for themselves' bit that interest me, maybe it means the info cant be passed on, it wouldnt be any use to another player for some reason. Codex says Raxxla could be just a state of enlightenment, journey in this sense just means the journey we are on as we play the game, maybe even from Harmless to Elite and what we have learned by searching wiki and subjects we have never strayed into before. Better not be though, Id rather not know than know that is it!
