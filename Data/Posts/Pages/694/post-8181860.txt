The real question is which one of you will make Art so great that it leaves a lasting effect on the world of Elite. Only a handful of each generation. Which one of you will it be?
Not me. I am just a simple commander who loves flying space ships. The art is the narrative, and the resulting stories that each of us experience when playing the game. Different for everyone, with varying degrees of appreciation from the user depending on their own investment and imagination. Kind of like Youscape if you think about it
