Another change was the addition of the new DSS where you can scan a whole body and know exactly where interesting sites on it may be and how many there are. Gone are the days of slowly flying low over a planet upside down hoping to catch a glimpse of something odd. So it’s made the basic act of exploration take longer really but with the benefit of being able to find the interesting things orders of magnitude easier.
May first I wasn’t a fan of the new honk system, still prefer the old one honestly, but the new planetary surface scan and signal scan system is more than a fair trade off I think.
