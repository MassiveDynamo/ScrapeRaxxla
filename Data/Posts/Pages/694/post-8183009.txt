man i should have done this way sooner. 500h and i never left the bubble too far. im discovering the joys of lone exploration and finding unexplored systems. im enchanted with this beautiful game again. im heading to the void section to investigate " the sirens of the deepest void" from the toast. see if any suspicious sirens are hiding there, passing by colonia on my way. elite is a beautifull game. funny thing is. when i first found out about raxxla, i thought thats it, i never wana do anything else in the game but finding raxxla. but funnily enaugh, the search for raxxla is making me explore all the aspects of the game one by one. serving as a tour guide through all the game's mechanics. feels like a journey to me.

I’d recommend signing up to a long distance expedition. I’ve been double elite for ages, got exploration first then trade, been out to the FRift seeking the mystery then out again to visit the desolate Dynasty megaship, headed out towards BLoop, etc, but my time on DW2 was just a fantastic experience. Lone exploration is interesting but it gets even better if there are other pilots involved.
