Racks - lah / Racks - la

I guess, in the Codex its Racks-la (hard ending).

I would say English accents are based around the vowels sound so 'a' can be spoken as 'a' or 'ah' or even 'eh' sounding - Cat, Cart, Say and then accents come into force as well. Bath can be pronounced Bath/Barthe/Baythe depending on the vowel sound which can be regional accents.
