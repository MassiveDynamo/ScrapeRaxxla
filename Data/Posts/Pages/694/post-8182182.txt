Not me. I am just a simple commander who loves flying space ships. The art is the narrative, and the resulting stories that each of us experience when playing the game. Different for everyone, with varying degrees of appreciation from the user depending on their own investment and imagination. Kind of like Youscape if you think about it

Ya ive been playing with the idea that the winking cat is taking us through the looking glass - showing us art that reflects an attempt to change or symbolize reality... atleast the art we have descriptions of.

An art installation that changes based on your taste.... a down and out painters defiant self portrait.... another painters symbolic painting of the horrors of war... a giant hologram based off the federation symbol... and statues depicting the formation of the empire.... simulacra if u will.

i also think his thefts were timed to other events to tell us sheeple to open our eyes. The question is ... when FDev was telling us it was all unreal.... was that really the red king calling us figments of his imagination?
