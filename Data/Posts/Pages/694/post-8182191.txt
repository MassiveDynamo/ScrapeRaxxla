Ya ive been playing with the idea that the winking cat is taking us through the looking glass - showing us art that reflects an attempt to change or symbolize reality... atleast the art we have descriptions of.

An art installation that changes based on your taste.... a down and out painters defiant self portrait.... another painters symbolic painting of the horrors of war... a giant hologram based off the federation symbol... and statues depicting the formation of the empire.... simulacra if u will.

i also think his thefts were timed to other events to tell us sheeple to open our eyes. The question is ... when FDev was telling us it was all unreal.... was that really the red king calling us figments of his imagination?

Unless the Winking Cat is planning to turn earth into an asteroid belt. I seem to remember talk of some secret super weapon being developed on a moon base. A “Death Star” if you will Dr.Evil voice. Paintings representing the unattainable Aristotelian ideal of earth, the horrors of war, penance being given to the feds, Terra Absentia, the feds New Dawn being stolen. Maybe they’re gonna boom the blue dot
