Join an expedition on EDSM or maybe follow the route of an old one, Im currently doing the Dove Enigma expedition backwards from Colonia to the bubble, you get some interesting systems to visit as well as find your own.

The only annoying thing is when youre far out and an II or CG happens that you wanted to take part in.

If youre going to Colonia make sure you check out the Conflux mysteries on the way, Ill be there soon myself on XB.

One final tip. In GalMap learn to use the filters (star class mainly, civilisation etc) to find interesting systems. Turn off all stars and look for little white dots, zoom in and turn stars back on, its a planetary nebula. Turn off M stars for a more interesting route (check fuel stars are on route - be fine til past Colonia but in Void may be different matter). look for O stars, your ship looks amazing in the light in external view. Keep an eye out for NS and BH nearby. GalMap is way underused by majority of people and theres a ton of info there if you use it right.

In FSS check Gravity, Orbital Period and Rotational Period (all readable before Geo signs resolve usually with practice). High or very low G are great fun especially in SRV (around 1.4G SRV acts like GTA or normal driving games ie normal gravity/response, I love it). Fast Orbits mean quick changing sky. Rotational period the same, especially if you can land on it and watch the stars whizzing by. (0.1 = 2.4hrs = 144 minutes)

Sorry if you know all this. either way have a blast!
