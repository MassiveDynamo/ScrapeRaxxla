I've had this idea on the backburner for a while now because I assume it's already been suggested, and because I'm not familiar with the 1984 Elite at all, but is it possible that Raxxla is hidden in the 1984 Elite that's free in the Frontier online store? Or, at least hints in that version of Elite that could help us find Raxxla in Elite: Dangerous? I never explicitly recall reading that Raxxla is in Elite: Dangerous specifically, just that it exists and only a select few know where it is. Thoughts? Opinions? Has this route been explored before?

I understand this has already been disproved on the basis that Raxxla was not actually in the original Elite ; apparently the name is incompatible with the procedural coding mechanism they used, and the code was extensively analysed.

Drew Wagar reported that David Braben had confirmed (I think at the first Lavecon, but see the first page of this thread-Macros linked the original sources) Raxxla is in-game for Elite Dangerous from the outset, he knows where it is, and there will be no clues.

Since the phrase used was “where it is” I think the only thing we know is that it is not a wandering celestial body.
