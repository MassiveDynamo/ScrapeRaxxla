Not only that, I would think that, given the way that the game works, it wouldn't even be possible to have a celestial body navigating the galaxy. Sure, within a system there is rotation and orbit and travel, but the game handles that on a micro-level with instancing. I wouldn't think it would be able to handle that on a macro-level, galaxy wide.

It would just mean that the body was not in any orbit. It would not be moving fast enough to change system during the lifetime of the game(unless it has a hyperdrive).

We actually have a bunch of obfuscated unscannable celestial bodies in ED. The comets are not yet visible(ADS probably needs an upgrade[big grin]), but they are there. Some even have stations in orbit.

The comet mechanics would be a convenient way to hide a celestial body from detection of regular scanners.
