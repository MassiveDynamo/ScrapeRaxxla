Is SAP an acronym? If so, do we know what it means?

Anyone tried using a barcode reader on a SAP 8 Core canister yet?

Hmm that barcode looks to be specifically Codabar NW-7 format, and it is a 4-digit code.

Would need a higher res screenshot of the barcode to translate and scan it.

I think thatâ€™s a dead-end lead but who knows.
