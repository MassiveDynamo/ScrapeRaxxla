Imho: there no longer is that "part a tiny bit obvious". TDW doesn't act like it is supposed to, from the point of view of the lore. The Quest is on standby, maybe dead. All the Cmdrs from the days of the E/F missions gave up, no one is still actively looking for The Myth. Nobody knows what he is doing. Best hope to save this game from being a tedious ' frag the Tharg' is a major patch. Anyway, a "Raxxla" which can be discovered by randomly stumbling on it , be it a POI or some celestial body Easter Egg, doesn't sound quite interesting to me... The Zuraxxla , or worse ... The Hunt 2 [haha].
40 billions of emptiness...
Such a pity.
