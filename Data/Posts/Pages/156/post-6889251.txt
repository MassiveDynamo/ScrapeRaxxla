I think in one of the ian bell interviews I found he said that Raxxla was in the original game. But not in the original release. I think he said it was in several of the original elite games, but only ones release on certain systems. AKA different releases for different computer systems besides PC had difference content in them. So, I think it depends which version of Elite is being referred too. I was wondering if it was in the original they gave us for buying elite dangerous. Which version is it equivalent too or is it unique version.

From the sounds of it from that qoute it sound like it could easily be in a system waiting to be revealed like the previous content. It should not be surprising if it's in a locked system and waiting to be used for story content.

My operating theory is that Raxxla can be found (isnt permit locked), but there exist "story" content, by Fdev, ready and waiting for the moment Raxxla is at last found. Best evidence for this was in Michael Brookes last statement on it: Question: "You have said that there will be no clues though?" Brookes: "That's true, but I think you have to make some of it a tiny bit obvious just so people know what they're doing. There's nothing to be revealed at this stage."
'at this stage' - implying Fdev already has plans for when its discovered in place.
