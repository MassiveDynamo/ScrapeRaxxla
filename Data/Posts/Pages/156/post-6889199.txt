I understand this has already been disproved on the basis that Raxxla was not actually in the original Elite ; apparently the name is incompatible with the procedural coding mechanism they used, and the code was extensively analysed.

Drew Wagar reported that David Braben had confirmed (I think at the first Lavecon, but see the first page of this thread-Macros linked the original sources) Raxxla is in-game for Elite Dangerous from the outset, he knows where it is, and there will be no clues.

Since the phrase used was “where it is” I think the only thing we know is that it is not a wandering celestial body.

I think in one of the ian bell interviews I found he said that Raxxla was in the original game. But not in the original release. I think he said it was in several of the original elite games, but only ones release on certain systems. AKA different releases for different computer systems besides PC had difference content in them. So, I think it depends which version of Elite is being referred too. I was wondering if it was in the original they gave us for buying elite dangerous. Which version is it equivalent too or is it unique version.

From the sounds of it from that qoute it sound like it could easily be in a system waiting to be revealed like the previous content. It should not be surprising if it's in a locked system and waiting to be used for story content.
