I've had this idea on the backburner for a while now because I assume it's already been suggested, and because I'm not familiar with the 1984 Elite at all, but is it possible that Raxxla is hidden in the 1984 Elite that's free in the Frontier online store? Or, at least hints in that version of Elite that could help us find Raxxla in Elite: Dangerous? I never explicitly recall reading that Raxxla is in Elite: Dangerous specifically, just that it exists and only a select few know where it is. Thoughts? Opinions? Has this route been explored before?
