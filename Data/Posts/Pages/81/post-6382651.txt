The note about transposing numbers in Cd 32-331, I tried all combinations on edsm.
Only one possibility CD-23 13397
Which has extra 97 on name, works.
Little ghost a planetary nebula.
A planetary nebula in the constellation Ophiuchus. It was discovered by William Herschel. At the centre of the Little Ghost Nebula is a Wolf-Rayet star of 0.46 solar masses cataloged as HD 158269.
Too far out from bubble I think...

What about CD-82 331? It is easy for 3s and 8s to get misread when typing/proofing etc. And that is in SIMBAD (not sure if it is in game? currently not installed).
