It doesn't look like anyone has uploaded data for Sirius at http://www.elitegalaxyonline.com

If you upload the system data into the system you should be able to generate an orrery view. I'd do it myself but I'm working on getting the Sirius permit (well, I DO have a permit but that account is over at Colonia).

Scanned the Nav Beacon in Sirius, but alas there there seems to be sync problem med EDDiscovery to EGO, so I could not upload the system data. Also not entirely sure that this is enough for EGO to display the Orrery. Sent a question to the EDD about the sync problem.
