Bug report it. If it's an error they will say so and correct it (just happened to someone in our discord, they spotted a star class was incorrect from known observations of that star). Fdev replied saying they'd look into it and see if it was possible to alter.

If they don't.... welllll

It's reported now. We will see what they say.
