I came across something that is almost certainly not at all relevent, but thought it was interesting:

We all know: "A Certain celestial body. Place that isn't a place, door that is also the key. The myth."

I always thought it seemed familiar:

Yog-Sothoth Also known as ... The Key and the Gate, ... Opener of the Way http://lovecraft.wikia.com/wiki/Yog-Sothoth

"...Yog-Sothoth is the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the key and guardian of the gate. ... He knows where the Old Ones broke through of old, and where They shall break through again...."

~ The Dunwich Horror by H.P. Lovecraft

And we know MB is a Lovedraft fan. Wonder if he finished his Cthulhu tattoo.


so is there any known system like Yog-Sothoth??
