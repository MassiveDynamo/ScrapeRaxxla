Ra and D is polar system coordinates. To define PS you need:
1. Start point
2. 0 angle direction
Then you can define any point by angle with (2) and length of vector from (1) to point.
In 3D you need 2nd directional axis and you do 2 angles to 2 axis or you could drop normal to plain of those axis.
Any way .. main point is you need directions related to something. On Earth it is horizon related to observation place, so you must know observation coordinates too.
And ...game is bad with directions. You know nothing about your orientations. It was challenge to catch Voyagers before FSS because of that.
Ok, I think we’re all more or less saying the same thing.

The issue at hand is (to use the terminology from your post) that we only have the angles, and we don’t have the length of vector from (1) to point.

That leaves us unable to define where the point is other than it is somewhere along the line from (1) defined by the two angles.

Which means we haven’t got a point in 3D space, we’ve got a line in 3D space.

We’ve got a point on the inside of a sphere if we treat it that way, but that sphere doesn’t have a defined radius, so we can’t translate into x, y, z co-ordinates.

So I think the question is what is being used to define the location?

Is it a case of just using Ra and D in the original sense and saying ‘it’s what you can see when looking away from Earth in the direction given by the Ra and D’?
