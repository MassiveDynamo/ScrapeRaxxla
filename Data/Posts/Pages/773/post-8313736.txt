Yes, but they were all told to stay off the subjects of Raxxla and Thargoids since they were reserved for FD. So the 50-year cycle might be a hint, but more likely isn’t since there’s no hint of any such thing in any of the lore (past or present, retconned or no).
I was initially thinking something about the 50 year cycle as well, but seeing how early it was in the process and how he later had to retract (blogs, videos) some of his ideas I just assume it's part of his PR in the initial videos.

I'm rather intrigued by so many of them (Harper, MB and others) catching on to the "Journey" meme that early though.
