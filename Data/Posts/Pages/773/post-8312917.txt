Addition of declination still wouldnâ€™t give you a coordinate. RA plus declination gives a bearing line, you need a distance to then get a coordinate.
I missed a bit ... you need coordinate start. In real astronomy it is Earth and horizon of it (to count angle). However you cannot land on Earth >:
Also we move faster then light. So we cannot relay on current astro data. As they show many years ago values. And now we see different stories moving immediate there.
