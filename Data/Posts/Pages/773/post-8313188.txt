Ra and D is polar system coordinates. To define PS you need:
1. Start point
2. 0 angle direction
Then you can define any point by angle with (2) and length of vector from (1) to point.
In 3D you need 2nd directional axis and you do 2 angles to 2 axis or you could drop normal to plain of those axis.
Any way .. main point is you need directions related to something. On Earth it is horizon related to observation place, so you must know observation coordinates too.
And ...game is bad with directions. You know nothing about your orientations. It was challenge to catch Voyagers before FSS because of that.
