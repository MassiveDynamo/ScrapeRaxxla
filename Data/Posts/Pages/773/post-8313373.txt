Yep, what Thatchinho & Alexzk said, however RA is defined from Sol/Earth so that start point is a given:
“the angular distance of a particular point measured eastward along the celestial equator from the Sun at the March equinox to the (hour circle of the) point in question above the earth.” (Wikipedia)

Yes, yes ...except game does not have any real tool for angles. Try to target Voyager without FSS scan. Direction and distance is known...
...or whatch old utube about.
...and to catch something in big galaxy, you need precision for parts of second of angle ... not possible to do like "turn left a bit more".
