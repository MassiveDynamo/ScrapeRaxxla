Past CGS have included something like 'explore within 200 LY of XYZ Sector'. Dunno if that's the most pinpointed things will ever be but its a benchmark.

No idea how close the Zuara clues lead, know they lead to the Sector eventually but believe additional clues had to be given to narrow it down

Just gives some indicator if relevant of how frontier have approached these vector type riddles before.

Remember if its does mean Right Ascension etc its been retconned to mean that, it didn't mean anything originally.
