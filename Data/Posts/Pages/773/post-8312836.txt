This is not a coordinate. THis is a direction. From sol, 10 10 50 right ascension is a 180 degree ark. If you have a declination, that will get you to a coordinate. But the interesting thing is if you are in sol, plot a straight line to Regulus. That line aligns with that cassiopeia like stars in the ceiling. I am telling this again, im not saying its right there, but this is so weird to be a coinsidence.

Addition of declination still wouldnâ€™t give you a coordinate. RA plus declination gives a bearing line, you need a distance to then get a coordinate.
