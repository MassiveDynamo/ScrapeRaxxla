Does anyone know what the background object is below polaris when looking at it from sol?




In this case it makes a box with polaris and sol. It's below polaris and to the left of sol.

BTW, is hip 66661 a known off the map system?

Nothing in the Col 285 system in the above post, but I still can't figure out what the object is it was pointing at.

Hey Noobilite,
I'm not quite sure which object you mean, is it this little white dot as the background object? Or the 0:0:0 = SOL?
