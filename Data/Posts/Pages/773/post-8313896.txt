Does anyone know what the background object is below polaris when looking at it from sol?

In this case it makes a box with polaris and sol. It's below polaris and to the left of sol.

BTW, is hip 66661 a known off the map system?

Nothing in the Col 285 system in the above post, but I still can't figure out what the object is it was pointing at.
