Wouldnt he have had all the lore-bible source material as the other authors though?

Yes, but they were all told to stay off the subjects of Raxxla and Thargoids since they were reserved for FD. So the 50-year cycle might be a hint, but more likely isn’t since there’s no hint of any such thing in any of the lore (past or present, retconned or no).
