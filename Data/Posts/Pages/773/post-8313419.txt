..btw, while we're here ... similar to "bad angles".
Camera droids have zoom option. I tried to use it waiting 40 mins on road to Voyager ...
I think...it is wrong too. When you zoom in some stars get bigger like you can see circle shape...That's simply not true.
I have here 150mm telescope. Only planets /asteroids/comets (i.e. in system bodies) MAY get circle shape using zoom. Stars are too far away. They will remain "dot" for always. You may see extra details, like 2 stars in binary system when zoomed but both remains "points". Some more shapes we can see because of air.
Any way, my point is...we cannot relay on in-game cabin view or camera's zooms as it seems "not real".
