I will post something on this poster, about all this thread and my humble opinions, but i have to keep my thoughts together first. Lets praise this poster and series for now

Come now!! Let us not sully this thread dedicated to the pursuit of truth, and strange green lights, with such obvious flim flammery!
Everyone knows that aliens fly in flower ships, not in two metal saucers glued together around the rim.
Therein lies one mystery- “hidden on the outer rim” actually says “made in Sheffied”.

Now I should return to drinking my morning elixir (coffee), however my grail is empty

My pursuit of a Fed Corvette for young clone Tyko is mysteriously delayed today, for 11 hours!!
I would leave my ship and go for some gentle exercise with my copawlot on this airless moon,
but it is raining.
