Yeah. I guess so.
Sometimes I get dropped VERY far away from the star. never happened to you ?

Ya that;s newish?

It happens when the primary is a binary, trinary or more.
You get dumped out close to the gravitic center or something like that.
With hazardous one's close orbiting, you get dumped near the primary like before, I think.
