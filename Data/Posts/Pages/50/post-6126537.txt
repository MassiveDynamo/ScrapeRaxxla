Is Raxxla permit-locked, e.g. in one of the five overlapping spheres of Praeia or somewhere similar where entire sectors have been locked off so we can't enter them? That way it could have been "in the game" since the start but completely cut off to players.

It certainly could be. Since none of us knows where Raxxla is or isn't there is no way to rule this, or almost any other possibility, out.
