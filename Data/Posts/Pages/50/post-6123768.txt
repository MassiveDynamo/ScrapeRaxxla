I guess it's the same type of glitch as when we are dropped far from the star.

By the way, great mass jump, Macros. Thanks for the hospitality. A nice team you have gathered there.
I'll pay you another visit before the Circumnavigation ends. [yesnod]

Right now I am quite doubtfully about a system called Filipchenko...
In the middle of that 2MASS actually observed trail of stars. No entry of such a system in Google.
Why the hell did the FDevs name it so ? Tribute to the USSR astronaut ? There is already a spatioport with this name.
