I'm REALLY glad you mentioned this, since I just visited Omega Car and was dropped straight into the Neutron Star cone!
It meant I figured out what the hell was going on much more quickly.

Isn't that supposed to be impossible in 2.4?

If you get dropped into the cone like that you can open a ticket and they'll place you someplace safe nearby where the incident occurred.
