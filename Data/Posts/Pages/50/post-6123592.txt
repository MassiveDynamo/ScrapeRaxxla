The trip back to Shinrarta Dezhra was very quick due to the neutron star in Omega Carinae.

I'm REALLY glad you mentioned this, since I just visited Omega Car and was dropped straight into the Neutron Star cone!
It meant I figured out what the hell was going on much more quickly.

Isn't that supposed to be impossible in 2.4?
