Yeah. I guess so.
Sometimes I get dropped VERY far away from the star. never happened to you ?

Yeah, that's happened a couple of times.

But the weirdest one was when I was in SC, 150 kLs towards a star 200 kLs from the drop-in point.
I lost the matchmaking server and when I restarted, it put me 100 kLs out PAST the secondary star and 300 kLs from drop-in.
I dunno what that was about
