Is Raxxla permit-locked, e.g. in one of the five overlapping spheres of Praeia or somewhere similar where entire sectors have been locked off so we can't enter them? That way it could have been "in the game" since the start but completely cut off to players.

I did my first ever SRV drive on Lave 2. Would like to go back there one day!
