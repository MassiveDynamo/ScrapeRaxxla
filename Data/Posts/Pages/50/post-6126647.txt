Is Raxxla permit-locked, ... That way it could have been "in the game" since the start but completely cut off to players.

To me hints always implied players could get to it, not that it's in a locked system, nor that you need Horizons*. A base-game player, and hence base-game mechanics, are all that's "hiding" Raxxla.

So i'm still of the opinion it's mostly likely to be a POI / outpost you drop into, but is not scannable. Much like finding the Voyager probes: fly out into the black somewhere, get within 1000Ls, drop on the POI.
The difficulty is working out what system, and what direction to go...


* given Drew's comments were from July 8th 2014, and Horizons didn't launch until 15th Dec 2015.
