Well, Tyko has returned to Shin Dez & turned in to TDW at Neuman Camp 104,664,553 Cr worth of exploration data, including 3.4MCr for Chroarsts XY-S e3-41 and 7.6MCr for Dryuae Aug HC-U e3-78; just a couple of the NS he discovered on this trip, and also a few BH too, (33 of which he dived -silly clone, no wetsuit!), as well as 1 ELW, 1 AW and 12 WW (all mapped) plus one MS type star (Hypiae Aug ZV-T d4-10). (Edit: and the main point-visiting the a jewel that burns on the brow of the Mother of Galaxies; Goliathâ€™s Rest!)

We'll see if that grabs the TDW recruiters' attention!

Now he's off for a well-deserved Lavian Brandy (or three)!
