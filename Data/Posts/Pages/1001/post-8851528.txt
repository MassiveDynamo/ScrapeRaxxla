See, this latest article on Galnet triggers the tinfoil within me. The one about Rackham building an outpost in the highest system.

What makes me wonder is the writers again mention the Rhea Archipelago. It’s only been mentioned twice before in conjunction with the term Skyglow Havens but in articles involving the disappearances of Olav Redcourt and Consuela Knight. This time though they also mention the galactic spiral.

I’ll admit, as per usual, this could mean nothing but the writers having such a habit of using Rhea Archipelago makes me suspect something is going on, and as yet, there’s no call for community support for this endeavor so why does Rackham announcing this from his private villa there matter enough to make it into the article?

Is there a quadrant of the Galaxy named after something to do with Rhea? I know other regions have names like “Temple” etc.

Edit: Side note, Omphalos was also the name of the stone given to Cronus to devour by Rhea instead of Zeus. Perhaps a round about link to the Omphalos mentioned in the codex. I’m grasping at straws here.

On the start of FD’s Anchor man News report, it started off with Arthur saying “Raxxla discovery just around the corner” seeing as this news report started all this new content off, it could be associated with it.
