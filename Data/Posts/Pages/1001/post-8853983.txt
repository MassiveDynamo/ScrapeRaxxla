hyperspace had historically been a "universe" unto itself prior to all the game's ret-conning. It still may be. It's too bad they didn't leverage that more so there's an option to make jumping to other systems part of the gameplay rather than simply a loading screen.

odyssey wouldn't be a pre-req for raxxla. None of the dlc/updates are.
