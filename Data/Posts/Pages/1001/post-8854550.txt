This hasn't ever been stated by fdev to my knowledge. So imo, is objectively pure conjecture.

It was stated that raxxla was in the game and discoverable from the game since gamma ...pre-release. So it predates all dlc and new versions.

Raxxla is New Era content. Till then no1 will find it

Now, you could say that things said by Fdev at lavecon aren't written and recorded and so we're going on someone else's word of what was said. But Since this is coming from Drew Wagar and not just a rando.... it's as good as fact.
