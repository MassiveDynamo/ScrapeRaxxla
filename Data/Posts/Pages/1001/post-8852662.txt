You’re forgiven if you can translate the Finnish & figure out what Stella Nylandensis is all about, and whether it’s relevant!

Tyko is within sight of home, only 3.6 kylies to go!
Finnissh is not my forte, but Stella is star. It's latin. Even Finns use it.
Nyland is a surname. It means 'new land'. It's a Swedish surname. Those are very common in Finland.
The ending is a personal suffix, form what I can gather. Stella Nylandensis means, Nylands star or star of the new land (speculative).
