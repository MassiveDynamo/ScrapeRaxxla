Running this through Google Translate we get:
“He was also an influential inspector for the nation of Uusimaa and one of the founders of its secret master society Stella Nylandensis. “

Stella Nylandensis?? Will have to pass this over to our Finnish-speaking colleagues. But “Stella” is suggestive!!

Might be worth noting that he was both an astronomer as well as a politician. As an astronomer he specialised in photographic observations of the Finnish zenith to observe star proper motions & among his publications were:
(1906);
(1910);
n: o 2 (1912);
I, II (1916, 1926).

Has anyone checked out in-game ?

Edit: according to Wikipedia he also observed Capella, a quadruple star 43ly from Sol. The sixth brightest star in the night sky and the third-brightest in the norther celestial hemisphere after Arcturus and Vega.. It is variously the shoulder of the charioteer Auriga, a goat he is carrying over his shoulder, a single goat or a herd of goats. In greek myth, the star represented the goat Amalthea that suckled Zeus.. It was this goat whose horn, after accidentally being broken off by Zeus, was transformed into the Cornucopia, or "horn of plenty", which would be filled with whatever its owner desired.Though most often associated with Amalthea, Capella has sometimes been associated with Amalthea's owner, a nymph. The myth of the nymph says that the goat's hideous appearance, resembling a Gorgon, was partially responsible for the Titans' defeat, after Zeus skinned the goat and wore it as his Aegis.
