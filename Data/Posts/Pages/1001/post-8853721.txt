There are many options for 'other universes'. MB said there were no other galaxies, than the Milky Way.

In the Milky Way, we still have the option for:

LMC / SMC and other satellite clusters.
Witchspace
Guardian AI virtual universe.

There are also a bunch of large permit locked regions, that may contain something different.

If the 'other universes' are to be taken literally, we are looking at a multiverse setup. That could mean another Milky Way. That's an easy trick from a programming perspective. You you change a few seeds for the proc. gen. Multiverses gives me a slight headache, so I prefer to look at 'other universes' as a metaphor.

LMC & SMC are separate galaxies from Milky Way IRL, so I would discount those. Access to Witchspace or Guardian virtual space could be intriguing. Raxxla could be a specific Guardian site which allows access, or perhaps a device/access mechanism (“Place that isn't a place, door that is also the key”?) which permits access at any of the sites allowing rapid transfer (only makes sense come Odyssey, else you’d be stuck without a ship ). Paid my pre-access, just in case!

Multiverse might explain where thargoids came from. Find Raxxla...enter alternate universe.....get killed by millions of bugs...
Mmmmm!
