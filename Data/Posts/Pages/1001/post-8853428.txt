Ah, so nothing about spiralling stars, navel, gateway, door, key, obfuscation, etc?

Unlikely to be relevant then, although if Raxxla is a gateway to somewhere else (I’m not saying another universe ‘cos FD said there’s only one in-game) then it could be said to be “new land”, and the gateway might glisten in starlight hence “star”. Just hypothesising!
There are many options for 'other universes'. MB said there were no other galaxies, than the Milky Way.

In the Milky Way, we still have the option for:

LMC / SMC and other satellite clusters.
Witchspace
Guardian AI virtual universe.

There are also a bunch of large permit locked regions, that may contain something different.

If the 'other universes' are to be taken literally, we are looking at a multiverse setup. That could mean another Milky Way. That's an easy trick from a programming perspective. You you change a few seeds for the proc. gen. Multiverses gives me a slight headache, so I prefer to look at 'other universes' as a metaphor.
