Finnissh is not my forte, but Stella is star. It's latin. Even Finns use it.
Nyland is a surname. It means 'new land'. It's a Swedish surname. Those are very common in Finland.
The ending is a personal suffix, form what I can gather. Stella Nylandensis means, Nylands star or star of the new land (speculative).

Ah, so nothing about spiralling stars, navel, gateway, door, key, obfuscation, etc?

Unlikely to be relevant then, although if Raxxla is a gateway to somewhere else (I’m not saying another universe ‘cos FD said there’s only one in-game) then it could be said to be “new land”, and the gateway might glisten in starlight hence “star”. Just hypothesising!
