My mistake on this one chaps, it's And Here The Wheel, not Out Of The Darkness! I keep saying OOTD instead of AHTW for some reason, but that was the first time I've not spotted it before posting!

It’s easily done. It’s the frequent calling up of FFE and other lore that worries me, when I thought FD have said something along the lines of “if it aint in-game , in Galnet, or in the ED official books it aint lore for ED” and even then what a character says may not be completely true.
