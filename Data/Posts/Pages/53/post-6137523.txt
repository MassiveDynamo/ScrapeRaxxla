I've literally just finished OotD and TBH I don't remember them talking about Raxxla, I was mostly looking for Thartgoid lore , must have been a small part?

Raxxla is not mentioned at all in OOTD
(just done a search on my ebook copy)

My mistake on this one chaps, it's And Here The Wheel, not Out Of The Darkness! I keep saying OOTD instead of AHTW for some reason, but that was the first time I've not spotted it before posting!
