The reference to "RoguePlanet" is intriguing too! Has anyone actually seen such a thing in the game? (Sorry if OT...)

No, Fdev have categorically said that there's no "Dark systems" in the game currently (system that don't appear on the starmap/rogue planets, etc). However, next year they've said they are adding in more stuff to find like anomalies in space and other features - things like Comets have been talked about since Beta - so I would imagine that along with the Exploration updates next year we'll see "weird" stuff like crazy planets, rogue planets, close binary stars sharing matter, maybe even dark systems start to appear. Happy days!

I've not read all of the threads on this subject so apologies if this is not relevant.

If hyperspace was limited to 7LY in the original Elite game, then this could define the outer limit of reachable space from Sol. It would take a while no doubt to map this...

If you scoot back a few pages here there's a discussion on early hyperdrive and jump ranges and search radii based on that etc
