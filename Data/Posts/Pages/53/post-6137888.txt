It's "ED is informed by past games but not bound to them". So mining FFE (and other games) for lore clues is often valuable as long as you don't get bogged down in the detail too much.

I generally work on the principle that anything from past games needs to be taken as myths and stories until details are confirmed in the books or ED itself.
