I did a little piece on Raxxla for our latest issue: http://www.sagittariuseyes.com/issue-3.html Big thanks to CMDR MarcusTheBlack and CMDR DrNoesis from this thread for contributing and others on this thread for general ideas.

Very well done magazine CMDR! I enjoyed both the Raxxla article and the interview with CMDR Erimus. Looking forward to browsing the other articles when I have the time.
