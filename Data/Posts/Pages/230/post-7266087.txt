Went to Star of India(thanks CMDRGURU951) to check the blobs in the system map.

They look similar, but appear in a different position on the map. The two objects are a bit further apart and are located up and left. Alpha Cygni has the blobs in the far bottom right corner.

I also found this picture of the galaxy, Cygnus A.

SPOILER

Its a Quasar, suspected of having twin supermassive black hole at it's center.
