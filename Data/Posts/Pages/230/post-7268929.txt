I’m probably pointing out the blatantly obvious here, but just in case... you need to have an example of what you’re scanning lined up in the targeting reticule, and you need to keep it lined up in the reticule while you hold down the button until the scan completes. (With apologies if I’m just telling you stuff you already know fine well!)

LOL
yes, it is blatantly obvious but you’ve brightened up a cold, dark, wet, dreary morning!

Edit:
and I think you mean reticle; I believe a reticule is a small lady’s handbag
though if you wish to align your targets with a small lady’s handbag ... I’m broadminded
