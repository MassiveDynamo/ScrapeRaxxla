I've seen people make the suggestion that FDev wouldn't use some obscure book from the 1580's, but to level the playing field, the answer may lie in a tool the majority of us use, wikipedia and the "Translate to_______" Option. Astrophel and Stella has a wiki-page on the book which lists 4 of the 108 sonnets. This condensed version may be intended. Astrophel produces 1 result in wikipedia.

EDIT: [This is the full book, hopefully translatable to your appropriate languages.]
