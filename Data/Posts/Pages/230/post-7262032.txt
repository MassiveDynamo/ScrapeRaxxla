if we took all the known data we do have on the activity surrounding the old Dark Wheel missions and join the dots in a spacial ERD what will we get?

Honestly I think it would just be chaos as probably random, which is why I won't tackle it...

Old E/F missions started in one "cluster" in the center of the Bubble and then moved to three others in the rim successively.
And disappeared.
Easy to see this kind of pattern with the data in the FP. Macros did a great work.
(I spent months following this track. Found (almost) nothing. If anyone interested in performing an experiment, just ask me. By definition, can only be done once per Cmdr. I don't know if it still works, as much more than a year passed since. Shame on me I didn't take a screenshot at that time... But how would I have known beforehand that it was unrepeatable?)
