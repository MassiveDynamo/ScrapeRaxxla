Hello CMDRs,

Has anyone considered the fact that "Astrophil and Stella" may very well be a wild goose chase?

I mean, "astrophil" means star-lover, i get it, the sonnets were nice, but "astrophel" actually means star-cork. There's a Cork Nebula (Little Dumbbell nebula), and also a Little Dumbbell Sector well in the reach of a Cobra. I think it's worth checking out.
Also, after listening to the Codex entrance, i find it curious that it's pronounced a-strophel and not astro-phel (the accent falls on the "o"). It may be nothing, but after all, this thread is just a huge brainstorming session.
Those were my 2 cents for now.
