Ok thanks, I didn't know there was a thread dedicated to The Azimuth Saga. I have already read the translation of the code, a bit scary ...


Yes, I have been checking the thread and I was the one who passed you the path to Lemon Slice.
well, I think that's actually the second Hesperus thread. Might make more sense to just have one, but people create threads ad hoc & it is difficult to keep aware of them. I rely on people here to give me a heads up if anything is relevant!
