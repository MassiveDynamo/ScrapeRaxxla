Edit: there are separate threads for anything to do with Azimuth Biochemicals, Hesperus and Adamastor. Thus is the latest one https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threa...ge-from-salvation.581536/page-26#post-9345442.

Read the last page or two, that coded message was decoded, see: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threa...ew-message-from-salvation.581536/post-9347111
Ok thanks, I didn't know there was a thread dedicated to The Azimuth Saga. I have already read the translation of the code, a bit scary ...
