I used to lean towards lemon slice until fleet carriers made it there to no avail. I still don't always trust the lack of findings from those not specifically looking for Raxxla though so I can't be sure it's not. Unless someone here has put a good search through it. I'd go myself but cbf dealing with all that time spent on the carrier plotting routes and not really playing.
I was visiting the Lemon Slice with my FC but I didn't find anything. I also didn't do an exhaustive search because I wanted to go back to the bubble to make a Community Goal that interested me so much. Maybe in the future I'll take another look.
