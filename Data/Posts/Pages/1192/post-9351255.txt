Well, it is a valid option to check every inch of the solar system. But I don't think that's the solution, I still think that some kind of trigger needs to be activated to start the Raxxla plot. It could be any system.

Do you want some tinfoil? Why Sol? Why not Sirius?

-Sirius is locked by a permit, any casual gamer couldn't randomly discover Raxxla.

-Sirius is the headquarters of the oldest mega-corporation in the game, why did they choose this place and not another? It only contains two planets and their names are very suspicious: Lucifer and Waypoint. A waypoint to where or what?

-Sirius Corporation are the creators of the new FSD for all ships, perhaps they had access to extraterrestrial technology (RAXXLA).

-Sirius has anomalies when flying within the system with the message "Frame Shift Drive operating beyond safety limits".

-Sirius, in spanish is written "Sirio", changing the letters you get Oisir (OISIR-RAXXLA from the book The Alien World)

-The photo from the Chandra X-ray observatory shows Sirius B suspiciously shaped like a hexagon.

Many systems seem to have some secrets, I don't think we will ever find anything without some kind of clue.

Sirius is always a good place to search. It was the first permit I got, when I started of (I had the Sol and Founders permit from start).
There is plenty of mythology of Sirius C and and aliens.
