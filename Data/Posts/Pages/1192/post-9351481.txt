I was visiting the Lemon Slice with my FC but I didn't find anything. I also didn't do an exhaustive search because I wanted to go back to the bubble to make a Community Goal that interested me so much. Maybe in the future I'll take another look.
The route I found to it was quite out of the way to get there. It presents itself as a challenge for sure
