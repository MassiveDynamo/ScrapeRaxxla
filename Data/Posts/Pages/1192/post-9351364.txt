Perhaps that is being represented in the Raxxla img. Or not who knows really but it could be as worthy of speculation as anything else

Yes, anything can be speculated to bring it closer to Raxxla's theory.

For example, it can be a pulsar (G11.2-0.3):



Or it could be a nebula (Lemon Slide Nebula):



It might even be V'GER from Star Trek :
