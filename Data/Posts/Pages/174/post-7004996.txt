Oh, don’t get me wrong, what they were doing fits with the club. My point’s just that they might be a separate outfit. There’s probably some INRA legacy/offshoot groups, some Galcop legacy/offshoot groups, Thunderchild, and other long running secret societies and cabals.

There would seem to be some PF complicity in what the Black Flight are doing, with the system with the Overlook being locked.

On the Raxxla front, personally I think the club are a different group from those on Raxxla, though I wouldn’t be surprised at all if one of the club was secretly one of the group who live on Raxxla - Exo maybe.

One slight thing on the Guardians - I don’t recall any number station stuff there. First site was triangulated from a trailer. Others were via Ganet articles & eyeball searches then one more via triangulation, after which they started appearing in Nav panels and HUDs. (Not that it makes any difference to the point you were making about the club diverting attention from the Pleiades, I hasten to add!)

You are right. The number stations were for the Thargoid crash sites. Guardian systems(after the first) came from Galnet.
