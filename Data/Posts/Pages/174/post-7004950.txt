The Club did what they could to delay progress in Thargoid research. Most substantially they gave the hints(number station satellites) to find Guardian ruins. This was done to divert Canonn resources away from the Pleiades.

Black Flight operations seem to fit the Club agenda well, but there is no direct link. They do however have the resources to interdict and disable mega-ships. That suggests that they are on good terms with Sirius corp and Wreaken. The Club seem to assert full control over these two companies.

The Club is according to Drew, a Frontier in house creation. They may be the "powerful, twisted men" controlling Raxxla, but there are no hints to this.
As long as CEIP and TDW can be ruled out of the equation, they seem to be the only known organisation that fits the description.
Oh, don’t get me wrong, what they were doing fits with the club. My point’s just that they might be a separate outfit. There’s probably some INRA legacy/offshoot groups, some Galcop legacy/offshoot groups, Thunderchild, and other long running secret societies and cabals.

There would seem to be some PF complicity in what the Black Flight are doing, with the system with the Overlook being locked.

On the Raxxla front, personally I think the club are a different group from those on Raxxla, though I wouldn’t be surprised at all if one of the club was secretly one of the group who live on Raxxla - Exo maybe.

One slight thing on the Guardians - I don’t recall any number station stuff there. First site was triangulated from a trailer. Others were via Ganet articles & eyeball searches then one more via triangulation, after which they started appearing in Nav panels and HUDs. (Not that it makes any difference to the point you were making about the club diverting attention from the Pleiades, I hasten to add!)
