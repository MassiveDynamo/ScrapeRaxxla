I remember that article, but as far as I know, it was never followed up. Remember people speculating that the 'goids were replicating our tech to get in close and gather meaningful data, but nothing after that. Me thinks it was the pesky Guardian HOA coming through to spy on our neighborhood. Gotta make sure those are Tulips in habitat 3, cause they don't tolerate no daisies.

Darn, that's a shame. Was excited to see where that story was going because (AFAIK) the use of AI is outlawed within the Elite lore so someone must've been up to some shady business.
