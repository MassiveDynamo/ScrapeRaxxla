Thanks for the info on Black Flight - is there any reference to Black Flight or Palin in Premonition, or is the Club connection just inference?
Also, since they got clocked by Obsidian Orbital while they were showing off the name 'Black Flight' is clearly a delusion of grandeur. They should be called 'Bright Orange Flight'.

Given that FDev were reviewing the drafts of the ED novels it's certainly not beyond the bounds of possibility that they used information from them as part of the Raxxla mystery.
I admit it's unlikely, but it's also unlikely that we'll find Raxxla so I'm just gonna pretend that there's an overarching narrative that connects all the half-finished and semi-forgotten bits of the storyline together

Palin's abduction is mentioned by Patreus in a conversation with Salome and Arissa, about the mysterious "they"(the Club). Palin also mention these "Dark Forces" after his kidnapping:

The only ID the ship outside Obsidiant had, was: S6:7

All Black Flight Pilots have a code name that begins with SVI: and a number. VI is 6 in Roman.
