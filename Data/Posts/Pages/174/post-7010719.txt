Raxxla is the word they gave for this world, on finding how fundamentally different, and strange it was. It's them who live in a true spacetime, where events are observed in relation to time, where any constant and reference and relation makes any sense.. Not this witchspace of present of everywhere. How could this absolute, priviledged, mechanical construct have happened is beyond me.

Wake up sheeple! The speed of light is faster than the speed of light! This is why you can't see them until you are next to them.
