Thanks for the info on Black Flight - is there any reference to Black Flight or Palin in Premonition, or is the Club connection just inference?
Also, since they got clocked by Obsidian Orbital while they were showing off the name 'Black Flight' is clearly a delusion of grandeur. They should be called 'Bright Orange Flight'.

Given that FDev were reviewing the drafts of the ED novels it's certainly not beyond the bounds of possibility that they used information from them as part of the Raxxla mystery.
I admit it's unlikely, but it's also unlikely that we'll find Raxxla so I'm just gonna pretend that there's an overarching narrative that connects all the half-finished and semi-forgotten bits of the storyline together
Before the Thargoid Structures became public knowledge, the Black Flight were covering up their existence. So definitely a bit of a potential Club link, but not necessarily one - they could be entirely their own thing.
