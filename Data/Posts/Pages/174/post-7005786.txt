DW clearly told (link somewhere in the previous pages, too lazy to search...) that when he asked FD about the story lines for his writings, he was answered like " No Thargs, no Raxxla ". (Among other things). Reserved to FD.
Which makes me think we must consider Raxxla Quest as being independant of anything related to the Rift, the Club, Palin, etc....
I find quite interesting that TDW faction didn't appear anywhere in all the events, GalMap, tip missions, etc...since E/F missions disappeared... Just like it had disappeared from the game too, leaving just an empty name.
I must buy that Jurassic-thing game and look for a Raxxlasaurus on a Darkwheel island...

I agree that the Reclamation version of the Rift had nothing to do with Thargoids or Raxxla.

However, the Premonition version - featuring the same cast of characters (plus a heroic penguin-themed commander) - was entirely about Thargoids and a shadowy group of people secretly controlling humanity.

Since FDev already had a shadowy group of people controlling humanity from a base on Raxxla, it's not impossible that they used that shadowy group, rather than creating an entirely new one.

It ties everything nicely into one bundle, which FDev can then conveniently forget about until they need to introduce a different flavor of pew-pew
