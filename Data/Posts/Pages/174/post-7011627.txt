Been reading back a few pages and saw mentions of "superfast DBX's" and the possibility of it being Engineers-related, but does anyone remember a Galnet article from a couple years back about a DBX being spotted outside a station and, when scanned by the station, no life was detected on-board and it simply turned around and high-waked away?

Was this ever expanded upon further as part of some storyline or anything like that?

I remember that article, but as far as I know, it was never followed up. Remember people speculating that the 'goids were replicating our tech to get in close and gather meaningful data, but nothing after that. Me thinks it was the pesky Guardian HOA coming through to spy on our neighborhood. Gotta make sure those are Tulips in habitat 3, cause they don't tolerate no daisies.
