Been reading back a few pages and saw mentions of "superfast DBX's" and the possibility of it being Engineers-related, but does anyone remember a Galnet article from a couple years back about a DBX being spotted outside a station and, when scanned by the station, no life was detected on-board and it simply turned around and high-waked away?

Was this ever expanded upon further as part of some storyline or anything like that?
