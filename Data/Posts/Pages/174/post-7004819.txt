Before the Thargoid Structures became public knowledge, the Black Flight were covering up their existence. So definitely a bit of a potential Club link, but not necessarily one - they could be entirely their own thing.

The Club did what they could to delay progress in Thargoid research. Most substantially they gave the hints(number station satellites) to find Guardian ruins. This was done to divert Canonn resources away from the Pleiades.

Black Flight operations seem to fit the Club agenda well, but there is no direct link. They do however have the resources to interdict and disable mega-ships. That suggests that they are on good terms with Sirius corp and Wreaken. The Club seem to assert full control over these two companies.

The Club is according to Drew, a Frontier in house creation. They may be the "powerful, twisted men" controlling Raxxla, but there are no hints to this.
As long as CEIP and TDW can be ruled out of the equation, they seem to be the only known organisation that fits the description.
