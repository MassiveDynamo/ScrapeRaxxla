The french hors is loosely tied to the place that isn't a place and other universe threads, since it means outside (outside is too big to be a specific place, except when its a name for some specific place and if it contains Raxxla, might be leading to the 'outside' space, witch space). Thoroughly searched that one?

No, will only have paid it a brief visit after getting the permit. I see that there is a minor faction there called Brightlight Training. There's an old galnet article about the Federation doing some work with them. I'm thinking about the hyperspace lights mentioned in the Formidine Rift logs... could get allied with them but they only have 8% influence so it might take a while.
