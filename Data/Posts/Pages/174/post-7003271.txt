Good to see people tinfoiling.

A few points on what might be relevant in the lore.

According to John Harper and Drew Wagar, non of the writers got any info on Raxxla. Soontil was specifically created because John was not allowed to touch Raxxla.
John has also confirmed that the Dark Wheel never found Raxxla and that at the start of ED, they did not know i where(or what?) it is.

Fast, cloaked DBXs is 90% confirmed to belong to Black Flight. A private military unit, operating in the Pleiades.
Black flight uses almost exclusively engineered DBXs and their call sign matches the first reports.
This is probably the group that kidnapped Palin. It's quite likely that these guys work for the Club.

Thanks for the info on Black Flight - is there any reference to Black Flight or Palin in Premonition, or is the Club connection just inference?
Also, since they got clocked by Obsidian Orbital while they were showing off the name 'Black Flight' is clearly a delusion of grandeur. They should be called 'Bright Orange Flight'.

Given that FDev were reviewing the drafts of the ED novels it's certainly not beyond the bounds of possibility that they used information from them as part of the Raxxla mystery.
I admit it's unlikely, but it's also unlikely that we'll find Raxxla so I'm just gonna pretend that there's an overarching narrative that connects all the half-finished and semi-forgotten bits of the storyline together
