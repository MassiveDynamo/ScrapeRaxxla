Indeed. There is a very specific reason those two galaxies were added to the launcher and not some random nebula.
(the "Thargoid marker" / "Barnacle tag" overlays on the LMC; the guardians are still hanging back for now)
-the main image for elite was barnards loop for a long time; it's how we are shown where to look.


The "witchspace whisper" is 99.99% one part of the puzzle and it needs decoding if we are to find raxxla.
(might not be a coincidence witchhead was the first bridgehead they established)

Finding raxxla by sheer luck (as per the anecdote) only becomes viable after piling up the clues.


In any case, in time all will be clear.

Yes, and the fact that the Small MC is in fact dead center on the launcher is most telling to me at least. Hard to think it is just a random choice. I mean, if I was going to place these two galactic clouds in the launcher, then I would place them so that center would be dead smack between them, but that is not the case. Clearly the SMC is the photographic center point if you will. Interesting.

By the way, I did jump to the last star systems in the Milky Way that are closest to the SMC. Nothing usual, but I would have to have more clues leading me to search for something or some place there. Also, these "closest" star systems are almost directly below the center of the bubble. In the 30 jumps going there I ran across two undiscovered systems and returning a slightly different route I found another non-discovered star system. That is 3 undiscovered star systems in just 60 jumps. This tells me there is likely hundreds if not thousands of undiscovered star systems in the bubble region depending on how you define the "the bubble".
