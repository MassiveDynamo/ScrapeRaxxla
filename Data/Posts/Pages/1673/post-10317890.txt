I finally got one! WOOP WOOP! 8 days of patience, going to space jail and one Mexican cruise I finally got it! I've picked up a bunch of Guardian artefacts and now I'm hunting for a few Thargoid items. I picked up Trinkets of Unknown Fortune and scrapped the hunt for AI Relics.
Before I bring the FC out to the Landscape Signal, are there any more recommendations for items to bring out? Just a reminder, I'm bringing items out to see if traversing the systems around the L. Signal with said items will trigger an event.
This will seem obscure, but what isn't with Raxxla
If you can afford the time / cargo space to carry some Carbon, Cadmium, and Yttrium with you that might be of some worth to test. It relates to a theory around Frame Shift Drives in ED.
