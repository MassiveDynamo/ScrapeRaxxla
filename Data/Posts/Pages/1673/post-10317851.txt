Lave was next on my list to do. I'll try Lave from the asteroids and report back! If I was going to put my home way the heck out there in a manner that you had to go radar blind for most of the way, then I would choose a ship positional target easy to recall or pull up - like Sag A or Sol, but alas, no cigars on those.

I'm going to try going from the POI to another system supposedly linked to Raxxla in SC tomorrow and report back.
Edit: Thought I'd give Soontil a try, but its not directly navigational from Tionisla graveyard POI
