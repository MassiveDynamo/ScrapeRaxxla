It's not entirely unreasonable to think that a portal (alien construct / Omphalos rift) on Raxxla could be a gateway to one or both the MCs. That just leaves us with the problem of finding Raxxla again.
Indeed. There is a very specific reason those two galaxies were added to the launcher and not some random nebula.
(the "Thargoid marker" / "Barnacle tag" overlays on the LMC; the guardians are still hanging back for now)
-the main image for elite was barnards loop for a long time; it's how we are shown where to look.


The "witchspace whisper" is 99.99% one part of the puzzle and it needs decoding if we are to find raxxla.
(might not be a coincidence witchhead was the first bridgehead they established)

Finding raxxla by sheer luck (as per the anecdote) only becomes viable after piling up the clues.


In any case, in time all will be clear.
