I chose a route from the POI and headed towards Lave. Lave being the home system for Galcop, unless that lore has changed? The game was difficult, as when you reach 3,100,000ls it changes to 0.10ly so it's not exact. I found nothing either. No signal sources or gravitational anomalies. I sorta hoped a Gravitational pull would be that massive, you'd get pulled out of super cruise.
Lave was next on my list to do. I'll try Lave from the asteroids and report back! If I was going to put my home way the heck out there in a manner that you had to go radar blind for most of the way, then I would choose a ship positional target easy to recall or pull up - like Sag A or Sol, but alas, no cigars on those.
