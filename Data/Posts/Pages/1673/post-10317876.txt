What gives me pause about this whole idea is that the game didn't even bother to put the Graveyard in Tionisla. If they were going to place Rafe's Anaconda in the game, you'd think they would have placed the graveyard. I'll look at a few more targets over time, but I am not going to go much more beyond that. It would have been a great idea to leave some clues behind in Rafe's Conda, and fun to discover. But alas, and again, it seems like ED doesn't thrill its audience with thoughtful methods of discovery and intrigue. JMHO--
I feel it's a good course, worth looking in to anything in super cruise towards any system that's 0.1ly from The graveyard. Even if t just to eliminate the possibility. I've just tried Diso, the only other lore specific locations are going towards Leesti and Uszaa. There may be other less lore worthy(or overlooked) locations within 1 jump that we might not consider.
