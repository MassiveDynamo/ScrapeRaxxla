Prince Hermann Ludwig Heinrich von Pückler-Muskau, the author of the word fernweh also dallied in landscape gardening!



He was; as some have previously identified, buried in an earthen pyramid in the middle on an ornamental lake. Technically an example of an earth Tumulus. Another word for these types of burial mounds is a barrow.



In Celtic traditions such mounds were thought of as possible entrances to the Otherworld.

Such a link is tenuous at best, but it seems fitting considering the level of metaphor and allegory going on in the Codex.

I don’t believe the term fernweh was chosen at random.

I certainly believe that the image of the station garden in game, above is a reference to a Miltonian model universe, and it exists in game. How it ties together is an altogether different dilemma.
