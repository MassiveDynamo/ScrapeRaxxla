Haven't found anything 0.1 ly out yet.
Were you checking in the system or around the system? I believe the exact distance was 3,155,760 ls from the Tionisla graveyard. Although the only thing at the spot of the graveyard is the Curious partially decrypted beacon POI. I'm not sure which direction to go from it!
