This will seem obscure, but what isn't with Raxxla
If you can afford the time / cargo space to carry some Carbon, Cadmium, and Yttrium with you that might be of some worth to test. It relates to a theory around Frame Shift Drives in ED.
These items were with me on my original travels with no anomalies. BUT, I did not jump between many systems. I believe there are 8 systems to try jumping between. I'll do the first series with no outside items as a control then fly the same series with individual items.
