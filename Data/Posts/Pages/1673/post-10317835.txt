Accept that the graveyard ("the cemetery") was stated as being "always between the plant and its star". The POI is on the other side of the planet. At least right now it is and at best it orbits the planet. So, it doesn't seem like the POI is a marker for the graveyard, but who knows? It doesn't hurt to consider.

As to which direction to go... that is the million dollar question. Even Rafe Zetter could get off course so, you would think he would have set up his home in a manner that he could target his ship on something. But what? And since Rafe would have traveled there from the sun as his common point of origin it makes you wonder if the graveyard had been very close to the sun - perhaps in the asteroid clusters which are very close to the sun. And of course, there is no direct evidence that ED even added his home to the game.


ADDITIONAL:
If you travel in SC you will be going over 1,800 times the speed of light at 0.1 ly's so you would probably need to slow down when passing through the target range. If the game really wanted to be a pain in the rear you would need to fall out of light speed at that point. Knowing Rafe though, he probably would have had a short range transponder.

BTW: I tried going from the POI to Fortuna but found nothing.

I chose a route from the POI and headed towards Lave. Lave being the home system for Galcop, unless that lore has changed? The game was difficult, as when you reach 3,100,000ls it changes to 0.10ly so it's not exact. I found nothing either. No signal sources or gravitational anomalies. I sorta hoped a Gravitational pull would be that massive, you'd get pulled out of super cruise.
