Hi, i have a question too, very simple one:
At this stage of the game, is TDW locked behind an unobtainable permit? (Either Polaris or LFT 509).
Even a yes/no question is welcome, just like Jorki said to clarify the confusion and throw to a bin some hypothesis to focus on the truth.
I don't have an informed answer to this, but it is a decent assumption.

I requested a permit lock for Lave 2 owing to the Walden plot of Lave Revolution. I had hopes that Frontier would be interested in returning to the story and drawing on some ideas to create a connected story between the game and the novel, or the proposed sequel. I've still a slim hope that we may revisit this idea, but the reality of the situation is that Frontier aren't in the same situation as they were when I worked for them. The company is much bigger, much more successful and that has to affect the nature of any commercial relationship. I've had very frank discussions with Frontier staff about that over the years.

When thinking about TDW. If the plan was to develop a story having already placed some initial assets, then priorities or personnel changed, that does create an explanation that fits with much of the information stated. It is an unfortunate and disappointing explanation if true. It would be even more unfortunate if those assets were removed in an update.

I can't claim to have any insider information that answers your question as a yes or no, I'm afraid.
