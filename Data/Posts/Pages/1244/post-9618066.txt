One of the intriguing things about the whole Raxxla thing to me is that it has been stated by some that "There are no clues" in the general game, yet here we are looking for, and in some cases following supposed in game clues/hints.

I believe that Drew Wagar asked the direct question and was told that it is "in game", and I am also to understand that someone has actually visited the system, refuelled, but did not scan it. To me that is a really frustrating event, someone came so close yet so far away. in many ways makes the job of finding it harder. As a now, very occasional player since Odyssey, I have just really started to look and to be honest, I am fumbling around in the dark (Maybe I should say in the Black), and being of a certain age (62) I am starting to wonder if I will still be around when/if it is found. I do however know that a list of the actual facts, not speculation, would be of the greatest of help, certainly to this increasingly grumpy old Commander.
