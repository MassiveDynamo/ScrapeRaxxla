Nice to see such energy and passion devoted to all this. You can ask me things. I'm not hard to find.

At this stage of the game, is TDW locked behind an unobtainable permit? (Either Polaris or LFT 509).
Even a yes/no question is welcome, just like Jorki said to clarify the confusion and throw to a bin some hypothesis to focus on the truth.
