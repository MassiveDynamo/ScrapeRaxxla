I did however come across this in reddit regarding an entry in the codex, can anyone confirm the change/before writing?

OK, I found a strange thing in the codex today.

Codex released in 2018. At this time under Corporations, there is an Entry for Universal Cartographics
In here, it said Cynthia Sideris founded a company called "Omphalos Infotech" that had technology that could provide a secure "Galaxy Map" and help verify the Pilot scans.

2) now go to that section.

It says "Unified Infotech"

When did they change it? Was it a mistake? Clue?

Is "Raxxla" a device that our Universal Cartographics company uses to somehow produce the galaxy map? That would make perfect sense for when Michael Brooks said "Its a path every pilot has to take"...its the technology behind the universal map maybe?

Edit:
Secondly: El dorado is mentioned twice. One in Raxxla post, and once in the Alliance post about Alioth. I am beginning to think there are many little pointers throughout the codex.

Edit: apparently Raxxla isn't popular on reddit... I'll save my theories for the 1000 page forum post, and the Raxxla hunting discords i guess.
