This is probably the best way to manage Raxxla however probably the way every single other game does it and ends up splitting the player base up making it then not so good, Thargoids become really dangerous like in the old games, take over most of humanity/are everywhere, Humanity search for the final stand to make them disappear forever however stumble on Raxxla instead.....Gateway then now gives players the option of Galaxy A: Thargoid death zone...or Galaxy B: Humanity's new frontier with being able to use the "For now Mystery locked behind the Narrative Raxxla Gate" to travel between zones, this way seems the most plausible so every player can experience the discovery while also tieing it in to the "Narrative" however will most likely also make alot of players very very angry.

I honestly think that Raxxla is locked by storyline narrative from whatever storyline they haven't started yet, this would make it technically in the game just not actually in the game hence the vague answers/no answers just like when asked would Thargoid be before they where actually added to the game, no 1 CMDR is going to find it, no CMDR may ever find it in that fact, If it is found it will of course be an epic find however personally I think it will cause more anger than discovery, As Allen has said...if that one solo CMDR finds it what then? Big cheers for him yet then the entire rest of the player base has nothing really to play towards anymore unless of course they add a story/expansion along the lines of my first mention
