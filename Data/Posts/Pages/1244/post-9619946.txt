Attention! Breaking news!
Russian pilots from the regiment (Msog) managed to calculate and detect Raxxla!
The famous Russian science fiction writer Igor Marchenko from Nizhny Novgorod, who has devoted more than 25 years of his life to the search for Raxxla, admitted that the search for Raxxla is much more exciting and respectful than the final result. That the finale of the story with Raxxla, for someone will be a shock and a real revelation, but nothing compares to the very search for this cosmic Grail. I am sad to inform you that the finding of Raxxla is completed. In order not to spoil the search for this legendary place for the rest of the pilots, for whom it has become the main meaning of life, I write down the coordinates of Raxxla exclusively in in my book "Queen of the Sun" and only for my most devoted fans. The location of the Elder will be the coordinates of Raxxla. The truth about Raxxla will shock and shock many, but it's worth it. Have a good search, pilots!
