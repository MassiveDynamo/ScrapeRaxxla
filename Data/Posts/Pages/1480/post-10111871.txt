The systems themselves won't tell you the answer at least not directly, nor will factions, the answer was based on the name itself of the system. You would not know to exactly what to look for without doing some digging on the connection of Essafa to Earth. That said, the meaning of the name of the correct one clarifies the relationship of Mic Turner to Meredith Argent and (her) father. The thing was all mentions of Meredith Argent dodged on the character's gender. Further, Meredith is a relatively gender-neutral name so it was ambiguous. Might as well share it, since after the discovery they updated the Codex for the Alliance to clarify they were married and had a GalNet stating as much. Also, no deduction that this was the way was not as simple as looking up meaning of names (had initially guessed names weren't that important or were procedurally generated).

Yamatri is Sanskrit for "a daughter's husband" - https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/yamatri .
So the PMF "The Light Wheel" would have been created in Yamatri for the sole purpose of lighting the way for others, without sharing the details explicitly?
