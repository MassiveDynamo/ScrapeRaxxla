I'm beginning to think the terraformed world may be a bad lead. The Enaness connection however may be worth figuring out its' current name.

Their bulletin issued through Zeaex news agencies to the InterG news has been translated from Maenad jargon as follows:

'Having received certain tips from out contacts around and about the Edge and Core, we finally pinned the Peace and Lights down, far into the Uninhabited zone in a new system they have colonised amd named 'Porritt'.

The P and L's are disaffected ecodissidents who had come up with a scam to terraform their new planet using existing geographical locations so as to save money. These guys refer to the landmarks as 'parts' and the whole process as 'Dee-eye-wye'' which we gather is a reference to some an archaic building method. (It is?? Ed)

However, when we got to monitoring distance we found that the group had already split up into factions and were arguing ferociously over how to store the parts (and which were politically kosher and where to put them on the planet and who got to run the Old Rock Cafe etc. etc.) After making contact, diffusing their hostility and engaging in several long, tedious negotiations we wore down the various groups and succeeded in persuading them to return the parts in exchange for immunity to prosecution.

This process now being complete we hereby appeal to our various clients to stump up our fee as per agreement.

Tomorrow celebrations are planned throughout most of the Frontier systems and it is thought that Maenad Central on Wheelhead (Essfafa) are preparing a hero's welcome for their triumphant team.

Essfafa is mentioned towards the end. There is another system mentioned "Porritt".
