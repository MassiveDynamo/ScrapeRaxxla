And how is "for those with eyes to see" translated?

In English it could sound like "4 those with I's 2 C" or 4 I 2 C....

I'm guessing the translation blows that out of the water....so would have to be a clue that works in any translation...

Edit .. and does Astrofel mean star lover when read in Russian?
Personal take here so keep that in mind:
Bare in mind, Church of the Path in Shibboleth system and the impact on clues especially in this case. Astrofel would be pronounced almost identically to Astrophel. Now further considering the unauthorized version which had numerous spelling issues and I would run with that one. That has the unambiguous misspelling meaning "star lover".
