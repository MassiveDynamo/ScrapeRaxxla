Essafa and Essfafa as the same place
For what it's worth, I've seen mentioned several times that Fdev would not refer to other versions of the lore, and that the only canonical lore is now the Dangerous lore.
I'm not entirely convinced Braden would make such a choice, but it is very possible as to give the new comers the same chances as the 80's kids.
Edit : Would it be reasonable to think that everything one need is in the codex ?
