That looks like an O’Neil cylinder https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Neill_cylinder
though none have been found so far in-game. Or it might be an example of a station during construction before the torus is added. Likely an example of early concept art that was omitted during development; IIRC if you look through the ED art book there are a few similar examples.

It might be enlightening if you were to take the book title that in English is “Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars”, but your Russian version of it, and see if its anagrams equate to system names with increasing distance from Sol. Are the system names the same in both English and Russian game versions or are they different?

I think FDev would have taken pains to ensure all players would have a fair chance of solving their riddles, no matter what their native language.

We have all the names of planets and systems in English, too.

It's just that we were discussing the book and decided to read that place in the codex again. It talks only about one princess named Astrofel, about many stars that look like a spiral.
