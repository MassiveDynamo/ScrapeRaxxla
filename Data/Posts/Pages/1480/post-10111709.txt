How many are there in total?

If it is an absurdly high number it’s likely part of a seed from a naming catalog. However if it’s finite then it would not hurt to map them.

Mapping the names may identify something, either it’s arbitrary but distributed evenly; tightly packed into a box or sphere; do they align along a particular XYZ etc or have some spatial relationship to another sector of space?

Such spatial shapes may identify if it’s automated or intentional.

If it’s intentional, such an action might identify a pattern or practice, a hotspot or void!

But it’s a lot of work, well not really,100 or so systems could be plotted in a day - if your so inclined.

My suspicions are on a naming catalog seed.

Is there a way know how many stations there are in total named Delphi? On inara it is written that there are more stations then displayed when searching for.
EDSM isn't saying me anything about the Delphi stations.
Next week I'll pick up my old laptop, so I can run EDD.
