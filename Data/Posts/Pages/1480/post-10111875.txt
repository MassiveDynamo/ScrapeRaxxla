My thoughts about the link to Es-Safa is that Essafa (mentioned in the Mic Turner message in ED) is mentioned as Essfafa in FE2. So I think the Es-Safa (the place on earth) isn't linked to Essafa, what you assume to be Yamatri. I mean yea can be that Mic Turners Jones Colony is in Yamatri. But I doubt that is linked to Es-Safa.
