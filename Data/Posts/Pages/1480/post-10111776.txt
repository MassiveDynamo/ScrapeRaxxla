I visited Privir => Nothing special
Yamatri => The Light Wheel (PMF, worthless)

It would of course be interesting if finding TDW involved some strutured search, as you propose, but it largely seems arbitrary to me.
Like, if I take the historical parts of Elite lore (because Elite expands history), I can find only one Armstrong Colony.
By your reasoning, it would be worth investigating because there's only three of them and because it is related to space exploration (and rather strongly than the fictious character you cite, I believe).
Well, it is something, it could yield results by accident.
But you write on this thread as if you found something without ever saying it. If you found TDW, I'll sure make the trip there but it seems to me you're just toying with us
Or will you go check Armstrong Colony or any other location I'll care to mention ?
