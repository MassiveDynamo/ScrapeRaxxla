For what it's worth, I've seen mentioned several times that Fdev would not refer to other versions of the lore, and that the only canonical lore is now the Dangerous lore.
I'm not entirely convinced Braden would make such a choice, but it is very possible as to give the new comers the same chances as the 80's kids.
This is why Church of the Path in Shibboleth is important. Elite Dangerous is every prior game & Elite Dangerous made in a singular game. Shibboleths are cultural passphrases that distinguish members of a group from outsiders.

shibboleth
noun [ C ]
US /ˈʃɪb.əl.eθ/ UK /ˈʃɪb.əl.eθ/

formal
a belief or custom that is not now considered as important and correct as it was in the past:
They still cling to many of the old shibboleths of education.

a word, phrase, custom, etc., only known to a particular group of people, that you can use to prove to them that you are a real member of that group

Prove you want to be part of The Dark Wheel and I might reconsider. For now, you have proven yourself an outsider.
