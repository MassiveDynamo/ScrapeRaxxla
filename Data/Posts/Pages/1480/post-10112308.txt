I wonder how exactly they translate the text in the Codex?
I have now read the codex again in my (russian) language.

It says exactly: Princess Astrofel (that's her name) and stellar spiral. (i.e. a spiral of stars)

P.S. And long wanted to ask, what is this picture on the forum logo top left corner?

And how is "for those with eyes to see" translated?

In English it could sound like "4 those with I's 2 C" or 4 I 2 C....

I'm guessing the translation blows that out of the water....so would have to be a clue that works in any translation...

Edit .. and does Astrofel mean star lover when read in Russian?
