It would of course be interesting if finding TDW involved some strutured search, as you propose, but it largely seems arbitrary to me.
Like, if I take the historical parts of Elite lore (because Elite expands history), I can find only one Armstrong Colony.
By your reasoning, it would be worth investigating because there's only three of them and because it is related to space exploration (and rather strongly than the fictious character you cite, I believe).
Well, it is something, it could yield results by accident.
But you write on this thread as if you found something without ever saying it. If you found TDW, I'll sure make the trip there but it seems to me you're just toying with us
Or will you go check Armstrong Colony or any other location I'll care to mention ?

The systems themselves won't tell you the answer at least not directly, nor will factions, the answer was based on the name itself of the system. You would not know to exactly what to look for without doing some digging on the connection of Essafa to Earth. That said, the meaning of the name of the correct one clarifies the relationship of Mic Turner to Meredith Argent and (her) father. The thing was all mentions of Meredith Argent dodged on the character's gender. Further, Meredith is a relatively gender-neutral name so it was ambiguous. Might as well share it, since after the discovery they updated the Codex for the Alliance to clarify they were married and had a GalNet stating as much. Also, no deduction that this was the way was not as simple as looking up meaning of names (had initially guessed names weren't that important or were procedurally generated).

Yamatri is Sanskrit for "a daughter's husband" - https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/yamatri .
