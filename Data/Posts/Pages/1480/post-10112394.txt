And how is "for those with eyes to see" translated?

In English it could sound like "4 those with I's 2 C" or 4 I 2 C....

I'm guessing the translation blows that out of the water....so would have to be a clue that works in any translation...

Edit .. and does Astrofel mean star lover when read in Russian?
Well, it's about the eyes, as usual.
But the name of the princess does not translate as that name.
I remember a long time ago we discussed this and it was thought that it was just a woman astronomer.
