But this bush theory is likely is a step too far into tin-foil territory and likely twaddle. I suspect if this overall garden concept was related - which I believe it was, the placement of the paths etc likely is the only relevance, as one ought to presume one could interpret the design without all the information, It purely is dependent upon on how pedantic the Devs were, or their sense of humour.

Oh hey, you edited stuff in later - yeah, I tend to lean towards less complex 'readings'.

My current feelings about the Garden design we've been discussing so much is that it represents a system map, with the Miltonian Diagram that is the star/first planet a nod from MB to say 'yeah, this is me, giving you a clue'.

Given MB's fondness for Milton, I suspect the right place to look is somewhere with a Milton related name.

I do wonder what we lost when they axed the missions.
Indeed. I never got to play them, despite playing since (just!) Beta.

I really should get 'round to reading what info is available on them.

Always so much more to do!
