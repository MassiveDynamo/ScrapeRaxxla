Please remember however, Milton did not employ any classic model, he actually adapted them to his needs, the outer spheres different from earlier examples of this theory.
Milton tells the same story as Greek mythology. There once was as war where the defeated party(fallen angels or Titans and monsters) gets set to a celestial prison. The victorious party then devotes some time to earth and humans. Both heaven / Olympos and Hell / Tartarus are accessible via some kind of magic portal.
The portal(s) are occasionally used by both the victorious and the defeated to mess a bit with humans. The losers are usually swiftly dealt with and sent back to their prisons, when they do.

All these stories seem to happen in the approximate period of 10,000 to 4,000 BC and seem to spread along with the agricultural revolution.

In 3310 we know a bit more about the non-human history of the galaxy. We might guess who the winners and the losers the mythical war was. No matter who they were, we can be pretty certain they had hyperspace capability. In order to need a portal / gateway, heel has to be well locked by some phenomenon or really far away.

If the portal / gateway of mythology is the same as the alien construct / omphalos rift on Raxxla, it is possible for those who know where it is to put hints in space.
Both Milton and the Greeks basically tells us that the gateway is straight up. That is't very helpful, as we don't know the direction of up. We also don't know how far up.

We could guess. For example we could say that the Regor sector is a reasonable direction for up. The Guardians who lived there were defeated in a great purge. Perhaps some survivors were locked up somewhere? It's still just guessing.

What we need is for mythology, hints in space (and codex) and the alien history to align. Then we might find something.
