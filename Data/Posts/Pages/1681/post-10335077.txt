The existence of an oak/ash in that first circle may - if intentional, marry with my Yggdrasil hypothesis.

In game it does straddle the Miltonian model, it’s base in the Otherworld, it’s top within the Empyrean, again at most it may just be a marker that literally draws out what’s in game and states X is here!
Don't forget, I'm no botanist, just some nerd on the internet with a search bar and some time to kill

That said, don't worry about if it is or not, or try to second guess if it's intentional - just roll with it and see where it takes you.

Most of the time it won't pan out, but maybe this'll be the one that leads to Raxxla
