It's very easy to see a planetary system when the horizontal arrangement aligns with what we typically see in the System Map.
If we are looking at it through the Milton Cosmos model, then it would help to view it according to existing published diagrams out there that MB / FDev would have drawn inspiration from, and around which we have built this theory.


From this perspective, it is possible the symbolism is dealing with either the composition of the Empyrean, perhaps the Heaven of Heaven and the "waters above the firmament" ?

... OR
It is extrapolating a 2 dimensional map of the path from Heaven stepping down into the 10 Cosmic Spheres - represented by the 10 lights (?).

If we are following strictly what the path is connecting to, you could infer it passes through:
1. Primum Mobile
2. Crystalline Sphere
3. Sphere of Fixed Stars
4. Sphere of Saturn
5. Sphere of Jupiter
6. This would lead to the reddish circle being Mars?? around which the path encircles, which then progresses to
7. The Sun.

I'm not sure if that makes any sense relating to anything, however if the red circle represents the Earth then the water component could represent the "oceans below" in mythological terms and therefore the path is leading to the underworld, hence my earlier theory that the doorways or "Gates of Hell" loop this pathway back to the Milton Cosmos circle where the doorway leads directly into Hell.
