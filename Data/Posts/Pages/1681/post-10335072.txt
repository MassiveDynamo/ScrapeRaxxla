The existence of an oak/ash in that first circle may - if intentional, marry with my Yggdrasil hypothesis.

In game the network of the Yggdrasil systems does straddle the Miltonian model, it’s base in the Otherworld, it’s top within the Empyrean, again at most the garden may have originally just been a marker that literally drew out what’s was in game and it was intended towards orienting us (grant this likely now is all archeological).

But this bush theory is likely is a step too far into tin-foil territory and likely twaddle. I suspect if this overall garden concept was related - which I believe it was, the placement of the paths etc likely is the only relevance, as one ought to presume one could interpret the design without all the information, It purely is dependent upon on how pedantic the Devs were, or their sense of humour.

I do wonder what we lost when they axed the missions.
