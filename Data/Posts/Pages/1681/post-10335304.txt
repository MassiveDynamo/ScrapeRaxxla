More Nordic runes!

As the Shui Wei sector doesn't pass the smell test to me at all (why have both it and ICZ? why center on Achenar, which is not even part of its namesake? why such an obscure asterism, especially compared to the much more famous Beidou?), I made some calculations for a tentative "hell's gate" - all systems within 10ly of its border, both in and out, ordered by distance to Sol.

One of the names that caught my attention was Punraz - which reminded me of an earlier discussion about how on a similarly-named system (whose name of course I forgot) the initial "P" seemed to stand for the "Th" rune, Þ.
So this could very well be the case too, let's take a look at the Norse pantheon... and well, here's Thor:
Besides Old Norse Þórr, the deity occurs in Old English as Þunor ("Thunor"), in Old Frisian as Thuner, in Old Saxon as Thunar, and in Old High German as Donar, all ultimately stemming from the Proto-Germanic theonym *Þun(a)raz, meaning 'Thunder'.

EDIT: ...also not far from it is a system named after a certain Mesoamerican storm god who's best known as a Titan, Cocijo.
