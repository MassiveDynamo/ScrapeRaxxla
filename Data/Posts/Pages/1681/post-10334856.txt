Ok breakfast coffee starting to work....
If the left third of that particular garden design is a representation of Milton's cosmology what are the short straight paths above and below both it and the inner circle & the main path to the middle third?

The thought has just occured that they're indicating equivalence. So the left third is Milton's cosmos and the middle+right are then indicating a specific system within "the pendant ball", the lights possibly suggesting the middle outer ring is the system star. Could be the system containing Raxxla?

Edit
I'm considering it as a star (either binary, or perhaps with a single asteroid belt) then 6 planets. The fifth being a double-ringed GG. Anyone fancy a body search (Spansh??) to see if it matches any system within the bubble?
