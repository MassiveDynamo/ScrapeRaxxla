Punraz - a great find, yes a thunder deity; many thanks, I’ve since added it to my list of Rune systems. It too does fall upon that same boundary circumference of my hypothetical zone of Chaos, so does your Cocijo.

This area is denoted by various systems all with a shared naming after storms, thunder, lightning or bad weather etc.they all form a perfect bubble around Sol and don’t extend any further out. I’ve identified this area as being the Miltonian zone for Chaos.
