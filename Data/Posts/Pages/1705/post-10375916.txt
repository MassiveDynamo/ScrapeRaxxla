Technically I donâ€™t believe objects can physically travel between systems, as we exist in game in instances, surely there is no actual interstellar space aspect in game, otherwise FD should have utilised it?
This is what was so revealing (to me anyways) about the arrival of the Thargoid Titans. Prior to their arrival in game, nothing existed outside of a system instance and nothing could "travel" between them without a loading screen (hyperspace jump). Now, I'm not exactly sure if the Titans actually did travel between systems or if it was just an added visual effect layer over the starfield bmp, but it showed - for the first and only time - that the game can support an object that travels through the galaxy and not just jumps from system to system...which could, in the end, support the idea that Raxxla is a rogue planet. Now whether or not this mechanic has been in-game since the beginning and whether or not that matters, I'll leave to the more vocal members of the conversation.

If it moves FD just increased the complexity of the puzzle unnecessarily,
Agreed...but "if it moves" it is indeed much harder to find, which may be the point.
