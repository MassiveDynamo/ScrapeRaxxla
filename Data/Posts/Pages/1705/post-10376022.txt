Now I need to buy graph paper suitable for Kamea squares a la Agrippa and overlay the Raxxla logo over them after assigning Chaldean numerology to each letter in the word RAXXLA. Has any one done this before? It seems like this would be something someone has done before with the amount of people knowledgeable on such things here in this thread but I thought I would ask before attempting.
Just because something might have been tried before doesn't mean it's not a valid method. In the end we are all human and prone to missing or misinterpreting things.
Especially with Raxxla since we don't know what it is, nor the final details of how to find/instantiate/enter/trigger/get it to sit and beg!
