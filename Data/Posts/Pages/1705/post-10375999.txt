I do recall a few instances of numerology being used. Hopefully this search link works, otherwise use the search filter for "This Thread" and it will bring up some discussions.
Thanks. I want to jump into it taking the mythology/esoteric angle because I know I would have a lot to offer when it comes to that area and I do see the mythology "breadcrumbs" all over the place, its just the having no way to tell if they are actually breadcrumbs in the first place that can be frustrating sometimes. So at the same time there is that nagging sense of doubt in the back of my head that it will all be for nothing. I guess that comes with the territory when it comes to anything involving this hunt though.
