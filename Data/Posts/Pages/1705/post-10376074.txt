Nice story. It describes technology that the Pilots federation seemingly have access to. Like duplicating objects and resurrecting the dead.

It's also interesting that the protagonist is called Philip, the same as the original Astrophel.

Perhaps we are Philips (Commanders) trying to escape Peaceful Valley (Pilots federation)?
Good points, I had totally forgotten about Philip Sidney after being so immersed in Milton's cosmos

Maybe just as the pirates arriving at Beaumont sparked a riot, or like Darik sparking revolt in Freeholm, we need to empower the underworld factions of certain systems. This might then attract the attention of TDW agents who could provide the test.

If anything it's a good excuse to mess around with the upcoming Powerplay 2.0
