Now I need to buy graph paper suitable for Kamea squares a la Agrippa and overlay the Raxxla logo over them after assigning Chaldean numerology to each letter in the word RAXXLA. Has any one done this before? It seems like this would be something someone has done before with the amount of people knowledgeable on such things here in this thread but I thought I would ask before attempting.
I do recall a few instances of numerology being used. Hopefully this search link works, otherwise use the search filter for "This Thread" and it will bring up some discussions.
