I did make an attempt at something like that recently. It felt compelling but at the same time intensely confusing as I lack the knowledge to extract anything sensible out of it all
Now I need to buy graph paper suitable for Kamea squares a la Agrippa and overlay the Raxxla logo over them after assigning Chaldean numerology to each letter in the word RAXXLA. Has any one done this before? It seems like this would be something someone has done before with the amount of people knowledgeable on such things here in this thread but I thought I would ask before attempting.
