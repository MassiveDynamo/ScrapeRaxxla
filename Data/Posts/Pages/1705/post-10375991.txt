Arx Arcis. Seems to be unpopulated.

Arcis has some links to Hindu/Buddhist stories but I am unsure of the relevance here, probably nothing, but maybe not.
A quick google brings up the Arcis enclosure in France. Maybe another French association?

Tinfoil Drive engaged...
This "urban enclosure" houses the Basilica of Saint Martin of Tours.
Martin of Tours (ie. the place Tours, France) achieved sainthood through alleged miracles like raising people from paralysis / death, and "turning back the flames from a house while Martin was burning down the Roman temple it adjoined; deflecting the path of a felled sacred pine".
The etymology of Tours comes from the Roman era. In Gallic times, Tours was an important crossing point over the river Loire. It became part of the Roman Empire during the 1st century AD, and the city was named "Caesarodunum" ("hill of Caesar"). The name evolved in the 4th century when the original Gallic name, Turones, became "Civitas Turonum", and then "Tours".

Sacred pine - the station gardens?
Tours - Galactic Tours? Brookes Tour?
The Hill of Caesar - brow metaphor?
