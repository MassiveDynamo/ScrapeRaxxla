Speaking of names , see below ...

So , i realize i'm just a fresh-off-the-station newbie here , but i was just wondering: Without having to read thru this entire one thousand seven hundread & five PAGES thread, has anyone tried using the 'RAXXLA' word as an unscrambled acronym yet?

All i was able to come up with so far is.... 'Arx Axl' ---- mean anything? ( coincidence with the ARX currency word , plus "axl = planetary axle" maybe? )

*Again, my apologies if i'm interjecting out-of-turn or if this particular topic has already been discussed/decided years ago within this thread.

I did make an attempt at something like that recently. It felt compelling but at the same time intensely confusing as I lack the knowledge to extract anything sensible out of it all
