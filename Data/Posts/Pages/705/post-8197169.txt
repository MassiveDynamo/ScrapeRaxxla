I didnt know that, thanks. Also they were metal looking, ive only dcm'd vopals so idk if those have the same fissures for seismics or not. Would that still be a possibilty? I encourage anyone check it out and let me know if you get similar results

You are talking about LFT 926 belt cluster right?

Afaik it is possible for a belt cluster to have a crackable core asteroid. Most I've heard of is just 1 asteroid. I doubt it would cause that much of a dust cloud. Might be something else then.
