I was looking at the routes of generation ships today to see if there were "crossovers" found one so far... not really sure it amounts to anything... but ya ... what if what caused the Antares accident also caused that of the Demeter ...

SPOILER: ANTARES-DEMETER
I love the analysis here. I’m very hesitant to trust anything in regards to Sirius Corp though (they do strike me as the type to fake a ship disaster) but I’ll definitely be taking a closer look at Demeter and that region.
