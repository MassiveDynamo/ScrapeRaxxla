Dust clouds from core mining?

All core asteroids and hence dust clouds are shared across all instances, open, solo or pg. Laser mining on the other hand is per individual, not shared.
I didnt know that, thanks. Also they were metal looking, ive only dcm'd vopals so idk if those have the same fissures for seismics or not. Would that still be a possibilty? I encourage anyone check it out and let me know if you get similar results
