I was looking at the routes of generation ships today to see if there were "crossovers" found one so far... not really sure it amounts to anything... but ya ... what if what caused the Antares accident also caused that of the Demeter ...

Nice!
How do the trajectories line up in 3D? What's the min. distance between the two lines?
