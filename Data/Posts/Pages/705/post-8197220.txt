You are talking about LFT 926 belt cluster right?

Afaik it is possible for a belt cluster to have a crackable core asteroid. Most I've heard of is just 1 asteroid. I doubt it would cause that much of a dust cloud. Might be something else then.
Its this one. Also, for anyone who hasnt checked it out yet, here's the installation thats right there with the belt. The belt in question is lft 926 B A belt cluster 1, as shown in pic


I could go back and do more pics but im sure people will still see for themselves if they are actually interested. I dont want to overly flood this thread with my pics unless otherwise necessary. There are way more qualified explorers here and i dont want to push my ideas too much if they could end up misleading too much.
