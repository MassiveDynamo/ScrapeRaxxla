Not in my private group though. Would that cross from open like that?

I'm not convinced it's anything spectacular to do with the dark wheel or raxxla related specifically. I just thought it was odd, I guess because I was in a private group and there was no one else to have done core mining in the system.

Dust clouds from core mining?

All core asteroids and hence dust clouds are shared across all instances, open, solo or pg. Laser mining on the other hand is per individual, not shared.
