I could go back and do more pics but im sure people will still see for themselves if they are actually interested. I dont want to overly flood this thread with my pics unless otherwise necessary.

Well I am there now and it certainly looks like a leftover dust cloud from a cracked asteroid. I can see the remnants in mine.
