There are two conventions. In the Galactic coordinate system, 0° is towards Sag A. This is often considered Galactic north.
It's also common to use 90° galactic as north, as this is closest to earths north.

That's odd. I've only ever heard of the galactic coordinate system with Sag A as galactic center and galactic north at Coma Berenices.
