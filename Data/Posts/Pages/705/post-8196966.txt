I'd like to backtrack to the installation found in lft 9 to 6 b a belt cluster 1. So I decided to stop and check this out myself for the first time. The installation proved to be less than exciting. The real excitement came when I turned around and looked back towards the star. Can't remember if this was mentioned or not I feel like it might have been and I may even have commented on it but this belt cluster is super cloudy and I can't see anything at all. Also once you get towards the denser part of the clouds these don't even look like normal asteroids. I have a gut feeling this might be a shattered planet. it reminds me a lot of the way I pictured the real soontill from 'and here the wheel' after it was all said and done.

I will be the first to admit my exploration experience in this game is novice at best. anybody with experience that hasn't been here to check this out yet I would encourage to go look at it cuz even if it's nothing it still looks really cool especially when looking at the class L star from inside the clouds
Found a Notable Stellar Phenomena with a cloud so thick you couldn't see the local star through it (not in game or I'd pass on the coords, plus I've seen mention that specific system is bugged and the stellar phenomena don't always appear (DB-something? Near Witch Head, on the way to Running Man.).)

Went through at dead slow in normal space, found no contacts and it was nowhere near planet sized.

[Edit: Checked map, can't recall if it was Oort, BD-12 1172 or V380 Orionis. Shame they don't show up!]
