There are many supposed world naval's for sure. I was unaware of that one. I suppose I'm preoccupied with the Greek reference being that the codex speaks of the Omphalos, the renaming of a system in the Pleiades to Delphi (The Greek original Naval according to the Zeus story), and the Dark Wheel novellas mention of Greek mythology.
We have one over here as well.

SPOILER

The rock next to the flagpole marks the spot where Odin's two ravens collided and fell dead to the ground after racing from the east and west ends of the world.
