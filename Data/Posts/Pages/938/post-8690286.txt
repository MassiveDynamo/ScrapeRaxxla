@Macros Black - I think I'm reading your OLTT table accurately when you're stating you became Allied with Nuenets Blue Crew? Is that correct? I'm also assuming nothing unusual occurred because of that faction alliance state either...

The reason for the validation is I'm just re-focusing a bit on this suspicious system after re-reading the DW toast, and also because of the almost manic hatred that the Shinrarta D 'TDW faction' has against Neunets Blue Crew.
