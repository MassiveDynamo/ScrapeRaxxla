I deleted the rest of my response since I have no wish to get involved in US politics! It can cause offence to point out the stupidity of certain officials
But alliances change. Seem to remember a certain war of independence and a load of water-logged tea (personally canâ€™t stand the stuff, give me a good strong mug of freshly ground & brewed arabica!)
This is just a fake post from the fake questors! ;-)
