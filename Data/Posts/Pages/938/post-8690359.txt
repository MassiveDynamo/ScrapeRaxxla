We have one over here as well.

SPOILER

The rock next to the flagpole marks the spot where Odin's two ravens collided and fell dead to the ground after racing from the east and west ends of the world.

Ah, but is there any sign of spilt milk on it?

According to one greek myth Rhea wrapped a stone (omphalos) in swaddling clothes and “fed” it before Cronus swallowed it in the belief it was their son Zeus in order to prevent the prediction that one of his children would overthrow him.

I can’t find a system that corresponds to “lover’s woe” in the toast. Have downloaded a copy of the Odyssey and searching that for “woe” comes up with both Penelope and Odysseus since they’re missing each other, but there are no such systems in-game. Nor is the greek name “Proci” for the suitors of Penelope who would be obvious cause for woe.
