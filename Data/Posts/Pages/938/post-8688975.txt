Its just that everytime history gets edited i don't always get the update notes as to whats still historically canonical. Are we still and have always been allies with Eurasia or did that recently never happen?
I'm afraid that was about ten thousand years ago, so you have some catching up to be done. Lots if Paleo-Indians, like the Clovis culture, and some big cats and so on immigrated into Americas during that time, seeking jobs like hunting seals or the local mega-fauna.

If you want to call, according to linguistics the closest relatives (linguistically) would be the Ket people somewhere around Yenisei basin somewhere in Siberia.

According to some modern economists, it was a really good thing all these things happened, because otherwise South America and parts of Northern America could still be inhabited by huge predatory flightless birds known as terror birds. It's a bit speculative branch of science, but if these things still existed, they would no doubt cause some trouble for post-covid era economical recovery efforts.
