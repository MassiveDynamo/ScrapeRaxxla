I didnt, I live in quite a small village which is very nicely situated just on the boundary between E Mids & W Mids broadcast towers or however it works now. Flips between the 2 constantly and means I get TV like in 1990, 5 channels and BBC cant seem to stay tuned in to one signal so most of the time dont get that. No Dave, saw it advertised somewhere, will have to track it down. I had money on Danny John-Jules in Strictly! What a male hen up that was.

And just in case the Yanks ask, yes it has a castle where Royal Scandal has taken place way back before the Pilgrims set off. It is true that every single village in England has its own castle but not all Royal connected.



Ah you have achieved the state of Donald Rumsfeld!



Lol the last couple pages do make me wonder if people read the posts above theirs. Been funny though. Welcome new people, pull up a chair and scream into the corner it will help in the long term so may as well start now.
