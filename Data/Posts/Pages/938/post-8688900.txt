Dunno if this is a valid claim, but since 'Odyssey' is coming out, we should look at 'the Odyssey' for clues. Probably.. maybe not. Speaking of which, we might use a list of places/things/people/events in it.

I called my Annie 'Ghost of Tiresias' a few years ago,as the Odyssey was the best fit I could come up with for the toast.

However, its great to find a fit to the toast, but what do you do with it? So Calypso is the whisperer in witch space,yes,now what? (Time for a bog hog?)
