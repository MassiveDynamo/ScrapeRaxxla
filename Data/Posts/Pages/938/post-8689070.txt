So after a tip earlier in this thread, I have been reading "Islands in the Sky: The Four-Dimensional Journey of Odysseus through Space and Time"

Might have to have a few reads of it to fully understand but....

mythological trees of life?
omphalos?
navel?
pleiades?

Well this clearly puts Alcyone / Pleiades in Ithaka. From my old notes I see I have Scheria in NPS Polaris / Thuban. This was confirmed in this text.
I also have Deneb (Alpha Cygni) as the white rock at the entrance of the underworld. Can you confirm this?
