Jeru Shal 'im, hill of Shalim the original pre-caananite diety, the evening star, god of eternal peace, the angel of death.
A God lives by how often his name is evoked every day. Still a favorite.

There are many supposed world naval's for sure. I was unaware of that one. I suppose I'm preoccupied with the Greek reference being that the codex speaks of the Omphalos, the renaming of a system in the Pleiades to Delphi (The Greek original Naval according to the Zeus story), and the Dark Wheel novellas mention of Greek mythology.
