A place that is not a place, a door that is also the key

A place that is not a place

In Celtic myth the Otherworld was a realm which existed alongside our own, it was never separate, it was believed to have been all around us and yet not always accessible, nor visible to us. It was not just one place either and potentially contained multiple realms, ascribed by various names.

A door that is also the key

Access to the Otherworld, was by invitation or abduction by some deity. Those who entered by themselves were only able to do so at certain times of year, when the boundaries were lowered, or through giving or owning some type of offering, such as a magical apple or a branch bearing apples, which acted like a key.

Various references indicate there were certain entrances as well, certain trees (thorn, apple, ash, oak); fog, or water; hills; ancient burial mounds; and or mountains.
