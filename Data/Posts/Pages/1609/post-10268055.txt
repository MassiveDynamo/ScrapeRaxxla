I spent a long time looking in both Hecate and Terra Mater, with & without Trinkets in the ship's hold. But I didn't try with Guardian Ancient Keys...what you say makes sense so might be worth someone trying! I'm still enjoying Starfield...

still got to find a power, kill the terrormorphs, destroy the Va'ruun battleship, investigate the distress call in Charybdis, locate the missing galbank treasure ship, provide evidence against the Crimson Fleet pirates, and find the last couple of artefacts.
