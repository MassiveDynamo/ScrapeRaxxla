I guess that it's possible, but I've noticed recently some things happening due to what I assume is a translation oddity. In open I'll see Federal Logistics, FÃ–derale ... Logistica ... All sorts of variations. Maybe I've missed it all these years but it looks like if someone's in the same instance as me then some NPCs might gain these name variations - what I'm guessing is their local language.
