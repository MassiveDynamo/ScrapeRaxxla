In Celtic myth the Otherworld was a realm which existed alongside our own, it was never separate
The 'Otherworld' is also regarded by Druids as being at the centre of the cosmo's, some pagans also believe it is beneath the sea, hence the ties with water and the afterlife.
Life is a circle between all realms, a continuing path, the Otherworld (Annwn) is seen as the pathway to the terrestrial realm Abred (Midguard) where mortals live.

Access to the Otherworld, was by invitation or abduction, by some deity.
Again it does depend on what side of the pagan fence you are on, to me (a Druid) its a natural progression from the spirit realm (our true home) to the mortal realm, yet to others at the behest of a deity which you really have no control over, a bit like the two realms in Norse mythology:

"Warriors who die in battle end up in one of two places. Half go to join the Goddess Freyja in her heavenly realm of Fólkvangr.
The other half go to Valhalla, Odin’s glorious afterlife hall. It’s the job of the Valkyries to choose among them and bear them to Valhalla"
