You sometimes find satellites like this is encoded emissions signal sources near inhabited Earth-Like worlds. There's at least one other model of satellite as well iirc. It's a nice touch but I'm not aware of any game mechanics associated with them, although I suppose it's worth a listen to see if they are transmitting Morse code or something.
