I mean a jumping point that's not a star. High wakes are the only ones we know of, but they don't feel that likely to be it for me.
I think it's tangible. In fact, I am pretty sure we've all docked at Raxxla or something derived from it and never realized how important where we were was to the Elite Universe. It has been in every game since the beginning.

For perspective, the zero gravity gyms of Pi Mensae (current name) are approximately in the NW upper corner of the high resolution map. Sol is another 59 LY distant. Vetitice is off Gal Route 1 by one system. Follow Gal Route 1 from Lave (lower left) to Xeeranre. Go south 1 system. Full resolution map attached.

We need to go to Facece. I am almost positive it's the prototype Coriolis developed by GASEC. There's a reason Facece has a planet New America - Peter Jameson was a Federal citizen. Pretty sure Battle of Hell's Gate was the Federation invasion of Achenar following the Mudlark extinction. That happened in 2411.

In the oldest game, Braben always maintained there was a wormhole at the center of the galaxy. Did he mean Galaxy 1?
