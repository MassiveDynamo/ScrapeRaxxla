Also, a theory I never got around to mention here (ADHD being the most likely culprit):

The Dark Wheel's alleged words about "the whisperer in witchspace" are more literal than they seem - Raxxla is stuck there. Thus we need some... unorthodox FSD jump in order to reach it.

This 6.5-year old Galnet article might be a hint:
Fdev itself calls the noises in hyperspace … “whispers” in their patch notes … “Improved mix on hyperspace tunnel whispers and flybys”…. for what its worth
