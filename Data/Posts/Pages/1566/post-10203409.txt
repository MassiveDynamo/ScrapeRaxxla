There is a list of the uregistrert comms beacons here: https://canonn.science/codex/unregistered-comms-beacons/

One is listed as Lave 2.
According to Canonn, the Lave UCB is part of a puzzle ultimately pointing to the Crashed Thargoid Ship on HIP 17403:
Sol/Achenar/Gateway Numbers Beacon Mystery | Canonn Research Group
Several Unregistered Comms Beacons that are part of a mystery, which can be found in core systems.
canonn.science

The most interesting part is the sheer number of outright errors present:
the initial message (repeated on UCBs across multiple systems) points to beacons on Eravate and Lave, including times for listening to either - which are swapped
combining both produces a nonogram, but it's unsolvable; you get a system map, yet the bottom rows lack a unique solution
once this came to FDev's attention, they placed a beacon at Cannon's doorstep pointing to a fix - but its message, which is encoded by the letters' positions in the alphabet, has a 29 in the middle
that fix is transmitted by an UCB on the Moon; filling the given coordinates shows the pictured system's name, in Braille... with a typo
solving this puzzle leads you to a scientific installation containing another UCB, whose message gives you the location of the crash; one of the ciphered words in it has another typo
It fuels my fear that our search has been made more difficult, if not at present impossible, because they dropped the ball at least once along the way.
