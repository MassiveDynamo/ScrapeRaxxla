Elysium isn’t in game, but interestingly Elysia is - ‘she from the blessed isles of Elysium’, a paradise for the good.
"Transmission from Elysium" is listed as the destination tourist beacon for passenger missions to ES Cancri. I'm yet to go and check for myself.

The missions are handed out by the minor faction calling themselves "The Dark Wheel" at Puleston Arsenal in Shinrarta Dezhra, or were a few years ago.
