unorthodox FSD jump in order to reach it
You mean the varying grades of "Jumponium"? Again, those recipes are very well known. That isn't something "unorthodox". This is yet another reason the claim of jumping only 7 LY is very likely a huge steaming pile of rubbish. The propaganda we had to wade through just to get back the core lore is truthfully infuriating.
