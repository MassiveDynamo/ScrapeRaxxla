You mean the varying grades of "Jumponium"? Again, those recipes are very well known. That isn't something "unorthodox". This is yet another reason the claim of jumping only 7 LY is very likely a huge steaming pile of rubbish. The propaganda we had to wade through just to get back the core lore is truthfully infuriating.
I mean a jumping point that's not a star. High wakes are the only ones we know of, but they don't feel that likely to be it for me.
