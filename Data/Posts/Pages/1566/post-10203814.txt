It is possible, but it feels a bit odd. How and why would an alien device work that way?
didnt one of the older games have an easter egg that required diving into the sun with each ship in the game? maybe we are talking about something similar. raxxla doesnt have to be some op device or stargate or thingamajic... at least in its current, final, ingame iteration.
