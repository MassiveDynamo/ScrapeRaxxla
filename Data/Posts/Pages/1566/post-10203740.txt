I mean a jumping point that's not a star. High wakes are the only ones we know of, but they don't feel that likely to be it for me.
You really only need a condition or a set of conditions, for the game to change the target system to something else. This something else could be a system(we must have a target system) that is not targetable from the galmap. For example 'in witchspace'.

A set of conditions could be something like: In the influence zone of the Moon, in normal space, targeting Tau Ceti and then jumping.

Most likely either the start location or the target system, is Shinrarta Dezhra. This is the simplest way to ensure that only Elites can go to Raxxla.

If the jump of point is at a random unremarkable moon, there are a lot of combinations to test.
