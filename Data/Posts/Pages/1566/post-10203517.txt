"The first commercially available hyperspace system was known as the 'Faraway Jump'. The Faraway system was far from perfect, however, depending on a complex network of monitoring satellites, branch lines, stop points and rescue stations – which took hundreds of years to establish – to operate smoothly."

"It was around this time the phrase 'witch-space' first appeared, reflecting the inherent dangers of early hyperspace technology and the strange 'corridor' a ship travelled through during a hyperspace jump. Some even believed witch-space was haunted by 'ghosts of ships that went into Faraway and didn't come out again'. It is certainly true that a number of ships never reached their destinations."

On that note: Are the satellites the Orbital Installations? More than a few of those have targetable "satellites". I still think a great deal of this Faraway stuff is meant to intentionally confuse the issue. Example, Sidewinders were escort ships and had to follow the warp rift of larger ships (this may be in one of the novels even) because originally they were not warp capable. What if those installations are centuries or even millions of years old? They sure as heck aren't dockable.

This is why it may be ultimately very important scooping is mentioned in TDW novella, we have fuel scoops in all games, and the most straightforward explanation for Quirium is Hydrogen fuel. Hydrogen was a huge product of Old Worlds Coalition centuries before GalCop and as far back as at least Federal Invasion of Achenar following Mudlark extinction (if not all the way to Sol). Hydrogen is after all the most common element in the Universe.

Let's not forget TDW novella mentioned Earth including London, United Kingdom rather directly and reoeatedly (reward for combat sims undertaken by Alex Ryder). The great anomaly was Lave excluding it from the maps despite them needing oak barrels for Lavian Brandy.
