I think that Raxxla being a 'place but not a place' suggests that you cannot just select a system on the Galaxy Map, jump to it and supercruise there like it was a space station. If it was like that then, once found, there would be no 'personal journey' - you would watch a YouTube vid of someone doing it and just head to the system and see the sight for yourself. This is why I think there is some sort of journey that needs to be done. From in the in-game, in-character perspective, maybe there is something in the design or (deliberate) programming in our navigation systems that prevents us getting there and that needs to be worked around somehow. Mis-jumps, for example, are supposed to be impossible with our current hyperdrive tech but were much more common in the past. So perhaps travelling a particular journey will allow a mis-jump at the end of the route?

My suspicion is that The Dark Wheel have hidden their base somewhere in the Lost Realms region that CMDR Rochester describes. They may well have followed similar clues and think that Raxxla is somewhere around this area as well but have got stuck on the exact route. This is a class of problem, like a Falken's Maze, where only the exact combination of steps, in order, leads to a valid solution but we have no feedback on whether any individual step is right or wrong. Even so, The Dark Wheel might have information that could help us fill in the gaps. I agree with CMDR Han Zen, that Shinrarta Dezhra is going to feature somewhere on the route.

I'll make time to visit ES Cancri today to check out the tourist beacon there.
