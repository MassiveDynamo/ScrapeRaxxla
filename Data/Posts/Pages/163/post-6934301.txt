From this: https://youtu.be/BolMqymxLxE?t=2348 and https://youtu.be/BolMqymxLxE?t=1618
Two concepts DW was not allowed by DB to touch when writing his story lines: Thargs and Raxxla.
And Guardians ?
Can we conclude Raxxla is the second major subject in ED and is closely related to Guardians ?
And Lave not related to Raxxla. Major point.

Also confirmed by DW's tweet that, pretty sure among FDevs, only DB and MB know about Raxxla. (besides the"you don't know what it is, though")
Which reminds me the DB's answer " what a silly question, of course". Put in this context: "of course, look at the Guardians, here they are"

I see him more as Machiavelli, with those super cryptic teasing hints, rather than an archangel,
Maybe from his point of view we are the demons he's guarding The Gate from... [haha]
