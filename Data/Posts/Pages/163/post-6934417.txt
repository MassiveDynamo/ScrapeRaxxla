Of course DW had already used Raxxla in his Fan fiction stories, so it’s interesting that although he could re-use the Rebecca character he couldn’t re-use Raxxla ...

Drew couldn't reuse Raxxla so he created his own: The Rift.

Meanwhile Raxxla (and the Rift) got a mention in John Harper's And Here the Wheel and Raxxla got a single throwaway mention in Michael Brooks' Elite: Legacy. I'm sure that I saw somewhere that Legacy was marketed as "the official sequel the The Dark Wheel". I wonder if the whole "somewhat obvious" statement from Michael on DJTRuthsayer's stream might indicate that the answer lies buried somewhere in the text of Legacy? Just a thought ...
