Not sure if threads can be renamed, but perhaps we should add "tin-foiling" and "Rifter Retirement Home", or something to that effect, to the title?

I know there is that alien/tin-foilery thread in the forum already, but they are far too concerned with Thargoids and Guardians to not be taken seriously.
