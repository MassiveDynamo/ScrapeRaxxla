Two concepts DW was not allowed by DB to touch when writing his story lines: Thargs and Raxxla.
And Guardians ?
Can we conclude Raxxla is the second major subject in ED and is closely related to Guardians ?
And Lave not related to Raxxla. Major point.

Also confirmed by DW's tweet that, pretty sure among FDevs, only DB and MB know about Raxxla. (besides the"you don't know what it is, though")
Which reminds me the DB's answer " what a silly question, of course". Put in this context: "of course, look at the Guardians, here they are"



Maybe from his point of view are the demons he's guarding The Gate from... [haha]

Of course DW had already used Raxxla in his Fan fiction stories, so it’s interesting that although he could re-use the Rebecca character he couldn’t re-use Raxxla (apart from the throw away line in Salomé’s speech from Beagle Point). But I suspect that DB may have amended the Raxxla concept a bit from the original Dark Wheel description so that might make sense; DB would not want the waters muddying further.

Everybody knows of Raxxla, but only DB and MB will know the details. So that was just a throw away line to Ed during the livestream. Maybe we’ll get some more at the Ch3 release livestream..... I suspect the in-game implementation of Raxxla is very Machiavellian!
