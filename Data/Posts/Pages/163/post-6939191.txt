Does ‘Actinic’ help in some way I’m not aware of? Best I know of that means light in the visible and ultraviolet spectrum. Wouldn’t that be every single star?

“radiant energy especially in the visible and ultraviolet parts of the spectrum. actinic light.”

So I think that probably implies a type O, B or White Dwarf star. Unless its one of the specialtypes? Wolf Rayet?

though I think Hassan’s homeworld is immaterial to the storyline. There were some things in some of the log messages (ships & bases) that are still outstanding, but the general feeling seems to be that they weren’t actually implemented in-game & just added in for dramatic effect.
