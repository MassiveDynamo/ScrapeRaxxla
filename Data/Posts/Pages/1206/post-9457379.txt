I come bearing gifts for sorting through the lore (and finding tidbits that may have gone unnoticed based on relevant story arc). Now this only covers the permits in the Bubble and near Bubble that are stand-alone but it includes all in one list and sorts by distance from Sol (why you ask: because the two ancient probes pointing directly at Polaris and that was initial spread point for colonization). Have plans to add to this: allegiance (if applicable), inhabited status/possible location of permit givers on so of weirder ones, and potential connection to larger story. Now there is still a lot of this which you have to go flying around the bubble to get logs (e.g. crashes related to Black Flight) but its a damn fine start and far better than the wiki.

This is good, I guess we can keep adding systems and planets to it as we see fit best.

I did ask Frontier to release full list of System and Planets that we can actually unlock because it sucks we can't know which systems and planets are permanently lock until Frontier will allows us to unlock them most likly with future story line. I'm sure there are players trying to unlock system or planet that can't be unlocked.
