Took a Deep Space Piracy mission near Persephone in SOL yesterday.
Only had to get one Military Plan from a fellow named JAM, sounded easy enough, so I accepted.
Moments later a message popped up: "Btw, the target knows you're on him, and have hired an escort"

I was in my mission ship Python "Tears In The Rain" relative hardened so off I went.
Flew to the system, found the POI, and jumped in.

Big mistake.

The message was right, JAM did have an escort; an Imperial Cutter and an Imperial Eagle,
and not only that, there were 4-5 security ships tagging along.

Naturally they all jumped me when I fired the first hatch breaker!
Unfortunately no cargo was ejected, even though the message appeared "Cargo ejected".
After a tactical retreat, I tried again two more times. Same result, no cargo.

Allright, time for the big guns; flew to my Fleet Carried "Silent Sphere Song" and switched to my Federal Corvette.
Back to the POI and try again. Fired hatchbreaker after hatchbreaker. Damn, same result; no cargo.

So no joy in getting the Military plans. Next time I'll try to let him jump and get him alone.
