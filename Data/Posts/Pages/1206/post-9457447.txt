This is good, I guess we can keep adding systems and planets to it as we see fit best.

I did ask Frontier to release full list of System and Planets that we can actually unlock because it sucks we can't know which systems and planets are permanently lock until Frontier will allows us to unlock them most likly with future story line. I'm sure there are players trying to unlock system or planet that can't be unlocked.
I am trying to get us a better idea of what can be unlocked presently and how and how it ties into the big picture of the much larger story arcs.
