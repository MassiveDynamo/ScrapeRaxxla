Ok, not sure where you're getting that from bud, but we definitely seem to be talking at cross purposes.

Have I misunderstood this bit:



I'd read that as you meant you knew Drew was quoting forum posts from MB & DB, but did you mean Fyrd was?

I originally took Fyrd for granted as meaning when you find Raxxla you'll know it so was chiding you who knows their stuff to the front page for the Brooks and Braden quote though it would be interesting to know where exactly Fyrd heard just entering the system and you'll know comes from.

The only certainties we have are the Mbrooks and Dbraben quotes but they do mean its been there from the beginning so Horizons not required even if its been enhanced since then even the 32 bit version can find it, the rest is tinfoil. The withdrawn missions may be a clue or not.

I know all the rifteres in their heart thought of the rift as a warm-up for Raxxla and considering it wasn't found until spoon fed says what it does.

The odds are literally unimaginable.

"I found Raxxla and all I got was this lousy T-shirt!"
