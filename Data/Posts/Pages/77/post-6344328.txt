There's loads of stuff in all the ED novels that is not in game. In fact, I just made a list from AHTW, but it's not relevant to Raxxla so...

...but do you see the similarity? Raxxla, Cirag, both in TDW but not in Elite; Hassan's Homeworld not in ED; loads of places from AHTW not in ED... the list goes on for all of the ED books and probably the FE2 and FFE stories too (and don't get me started on Imprint, I was so sad when I worked out that all that stuff wasn't in Elite Plus).

Just because it's in a book, doesn't mean it's in game. The reason we're actually looking for Raxxla is because they have said that "it's out there and we know where it is". Of course, we're assuming "out there" means in game
