I know Drew checked it to make sure its there and he got the distance right. So what if its been chased and not found as everyone's batting exactly zero for finding things without their noses being rubbed it so far. 1/4000 is worse than 1/400000000 maybe in penguin math as all a penguin is good for in deep space is fighting off scurvy.

Is that the same DrewW who told us that the Rift mystery wasn't a POI?

Do you have a link for where he stated that it was in-game?
