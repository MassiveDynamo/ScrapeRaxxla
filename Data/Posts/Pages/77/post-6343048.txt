Except that it's been chased already and nobody ever found it.

Given that FDev didn't manage to actually put the Zurara next to an ELW, do you really imagine they hand-crafted a system 400 LY outside the Bubble just to tie in with Reclamation?
If you believe they did that, then you'd have to believe that they put Octavia's base between Ferenchia and Mistra - which they didn't.

Hassan's homeworld is more a unicorn than Raxxla.

Has anyone checked the alignment of Monoceros with Camelopardis, Perseus and Andromeda?
Or possibly the centroid?
