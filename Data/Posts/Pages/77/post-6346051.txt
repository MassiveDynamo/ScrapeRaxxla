Is that the same DrewW who told us that the Rift mystery wasn't a POI?

Do you have a link for where he stated that it was in-game?

No I don't have a link to my 800 pages of notes.

Somewhere in the rift threads

"Apologies folks - was looking at the wrong system!

Hassan and Sushil's homeworld is in the WREDGUIA sector, around 400 light years away.

I think all the authors should sue FDEV for not following through with in game assets and proper support. In fact we should all sue, we've all been deeply injured and emotionally damaged by FDev's callous and less abuse. The occasional tourist beacon where something supposedly happened doesn't cut it. We'll sue Jeff Bezos cause it goes through his servers so it his fault, he's as guilty as the New York Stock exchange was for selling Florida swamp land as developed suburbs and you know what that lead to, Hitler!
