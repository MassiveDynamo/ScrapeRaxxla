Is that the same DrewW who told us that the Rift mystery wasn't a POI?

Do you have a link for where he stated that it was in-game?

I think wires are getting crossed here and we’re going off-topic.
DB said Raxxla exists in-game and MB said there will be no clues to it.
DW checked on Hassan’s homeworld as people were interested & I seem to remember he said it’s there but is unimportant in the FRift storyline.
DW said the FRift mystery wasn’t a poi -the mystery was the Dynasty Conspiracy by The Club and Zurara was the visible evidence of that plot in the FRift.

now can we get back to the hunt for Raxxla without any clues?

Seems that a lot of people make a connection between Raxxla and the Rift. I'm curious if there's any actual reason for this link that I've missed?

Nope, no reason whatsoever
other than they are both mysteries
