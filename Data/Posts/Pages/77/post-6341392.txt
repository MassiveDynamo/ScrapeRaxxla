I thought Drew said that Hassan's homeworld wasn't important?

Yes, not important to the mystery of the Formidine Rift, but at least its something leftover that's confirmed to exist as opposed to chasing various ghosts that are not. Looks simple on the face of it a binary system with one actinic star and one red about 400 lyrs from earth in WREDGUIA sector. But ya know folks, chasing unicorns is more interesting than finding a lost pony.
