Ah, gotcha! So, it was more the other bit of Fyrd's statement that piqued my interest - specifically the bit saying that it was discoverable (although the other bit does kind of follow on from that, obviously ).

My money's always been on it being behind a permit lock, or through some other means in game but undiscoverable at present. So, if FD have genuinely said it's discoverable at present, I'm seeing that as pretty big news!

I fully take your point about the probability of stumbling across it being so low though, and agree (I think!) - in practical terms it'd probably still effectively be undiscoverable even if it's not literally so!

There is one small scale quest unfulfilled from the Rifter thread and that's Hassan's homeworld.
