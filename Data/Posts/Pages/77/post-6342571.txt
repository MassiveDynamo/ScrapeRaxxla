Except that it's been chased already and nobody ever found it.

Given that FDev didn't manage to actually put the Zurara next to an ELW, do you really imagine they hand-crafted a system 400 LY outside the Bubble just to tie in with Reclamation?
If you believe they did that, then you'd have to believe that they put Octavia's base between Ferenchia and Mistra - which they didn't.

Hassan's homeworld is more a unicorn than Raxxla.

I know Drew checked it to make sure its there and he got the distance right. So what if its been chased and not found as everyone's batting exactly zero for finding things without their noses being rubbed it so far. 1/4000 is worse than 1/400000000 maybe in penguin math as all a penguin is good for in deep space is fighting off scurvy.
