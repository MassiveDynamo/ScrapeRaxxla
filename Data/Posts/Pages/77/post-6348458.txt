Seems that a lot of people make a connection between Raxxla and the Rift. I'm curious if there's any actual reason for this link that I've missed?

I don't think there is. Besides..

“Thargoid incursions into the Formidine rift appear to be increasing dramatically.” (From the Rift thread FP. 'Doc' Jaiotu.)

and

If it does, then on Raxxla there’s an alien construct that’s a gateway to other Universes, and all that’s in those Universes in the way of bounty, and treasures, and aliens, and life...

The door the Thargs take to enter the MW in the Rift coming from Magellan?
Of course, since that, aliens appeared ingame far from the Rift. Raxxla could as well be in Col70 as in a Guardians system. I for myself suspect Raxxla is Merope 5c which is an actual key. But where is the door?
I would add: why in the hell the cultists from The Children of Raxxla are/were so tied to the Formidine Rift narrative ? These far-fetched fanatics have always been very well informed. (< RP)
