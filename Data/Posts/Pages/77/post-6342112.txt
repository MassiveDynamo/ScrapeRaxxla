Yes, not important to the mystery of the Formidine Rift, but at least its something leftover that's confirmed to exist as opposed to chasing various ghosts that are not. Looks simple on the face of it a binary system with one actinic star and one red about 400 lyrs from earth in WREDGUIA sector. But ya know folks, chasing unicorns is more interesting than finding a lost pony.

Except that it's been chased already and nobody ever found it.

Given that FDev didn't manage to actually put the Zurara next to an ELW, do you really imagine they hand-crafted a system 400 LY outside the Bubble just to tie in with Reclamation?
If you believe they did that, then you'd have to believe that they put Octavia's base between Ferenchia and Mistra - which they didn't.

Hassan's homeworld is more a unicorn than Raxxla.
