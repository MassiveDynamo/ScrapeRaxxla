From this thread. So I wonder maybe Raxxla is first type rogue planet from post? It explains the low possibility of encountering and toast describes the 3 points that points the location of rogue planet system, only accessible by FSD misjump.

Ive had that theory since the first time I heard about mis-jumps....

But if we take Fdev at face value, (if), than we have to assume that, since mis-jumps were dropped before the original release, in pre-alpha, and never made it into game play, that Raxxla is not a rouge planet accessible by mis-jump, and would be discoverable in another way. Simply becuase it was AFTER the Alpha when Fdev began mentioning Raxxla in game, and WAY AFTER when it was added to the Codex.

If anything, I would go with Raxxla being either a captured rouge, only on the outter edge of a single system, or my personal theory, that it may be a rouge-on-the-move kind of thing, almost the second type of rouge, but one that is visible and approachable, like a regular captured rouge, but a rouge that travels between a handful of systems in an orbit that does not orbit a specfic star, but pulls R towards different stars, so that R would only be in each system for a certain amount of time, days most likely, effecting the orbit of other planets in that system, before leaving the system and entering the outter edge of the next system.... (this would also keep the planet for showing in the system map or Orrery mode in my theory, since it would have no direct orbit around a specific systems star)

In that theory, we need to looks for systems with outter planets that have eccentric orbits, native planets knocked off their orbit, and then check all the neighbouring systems for additional eccentric orbits, and if there is a group of systems close to each other, it may indicate a rouge travelling between those systems, and then we need to really explore each system out too a max distance, like the distance of the Voyager Probes in Sol from their star, and see if anyone spots anything visually or in their contacts tab
