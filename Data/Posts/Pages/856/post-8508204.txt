@simulacrae: you want HOT Sirens???
In Space all Sirens are absolutely cold!

With the recent announcement of Elite Odyssey I’ve been mildly toying with trying to match Homer’s Odyssey to the DW Toast (I imagine FD hints everywhere!) -Odysseus wandered around on his Odyssey journey trying to return home after the Trojan War. He encountered sirens!
Jewel-? Helen??
Whisperer/siren-Circe
Parent’s grief-Anticlea
Lover’s woe-Penelope
Yearning of vagabond hearts-Ithaca/Home

Not checked for in-game references. Busy Questing!

It should be also noted that odysseus dresses as a beggar/vagabond before re-rentering his own palace to slay the suitors. The jewel never fitted for me.. otherwise there is a reasonable fit (it was one of my oldest theories..) and if it was a fit, what then?
