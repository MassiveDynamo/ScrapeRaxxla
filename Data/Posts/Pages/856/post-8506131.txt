Have googled but no sign of it. Maybe it was in a video, though feel like it was a text-based interview on a gaming magazine website. Sorry I can't offer more - I know it's frustrating when somebody says something but can't offer evidence (e.g. the "someone's honked the system" quote which I still instinctively feel dubious about).

Indeed MB declined the other day to comment on being the source of the latter!
