Ah that could explain why I couldnt google it, but I tend not to watch livestreams so I suspect he also said it in one of the Canonn/UA threads. Will try another search. Would be interested if you can find the source compadr√©!
OK, I've been through the FD Youtube and found the reference.
The video is: Join the Elite - Everything You Need to Know About Exploration
SPOILER
There are some comments by Michael Brookes at the following times.
13:45 MB comment about infinite range of ADS making things too easy
29:11 MB mention of extragalactic clusters
40:57 MB mentions highly-inclined 'rare stuff'
This is as far as I've watched through tonight, I have run out of time!
