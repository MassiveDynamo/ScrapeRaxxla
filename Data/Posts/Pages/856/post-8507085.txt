In Space all Sirens are absolutely cold!

I’ve been mildly toying with trying to match Homer’s Odyssey to the DW Toast-Odysseus wandered around on his Odyssey journey trying to return home after the Trojan War. He encountered sirens!
Jewel-? Helen??
Whisperer/siren-Circe
Parent’s grief-Anticlea
Lover’s woe-Penelope
Yearning of vagabond hearts-Ithaca/Home

Not checked for in-game references. Busy Questing!

3/5 hited on galmap. 2/3 is system names.
Circe - inside bubble.
Anticlea - galmap refers to system Prism and it inside the bubble.
Ithaca - located in bubble too.
