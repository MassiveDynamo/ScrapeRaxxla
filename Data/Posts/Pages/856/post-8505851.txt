Jaques station is unique in the fact that it is not just a station but a very old highly modified cyborg, jacques is its self an independent entity cable of choosing it's own location, it's not owned by any factions it is self aware.
If we still had the gal net records available you could read its entire history

Almost. Jaques is the bartender who bought the station and has his own faction. He was a Fed specops soldier, injured in battle and captured by the Imps who repaired him by making him cybernetic. He worked a long time to pay off the cost of that and then bought the station and moved it a few times before trying (ostensibly) to reach Beagle Point but misjumped due to a terrorist UA bombing campaign (bad JManis, bad!! )

Heinrich's Galnet archives has a collection of articles about Jaques.
