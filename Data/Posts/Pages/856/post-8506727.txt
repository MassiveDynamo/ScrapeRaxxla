I'm pretty sure that comes from the Formidine Rift thread, with Drew Wagar saying that a single player could solve it/find the mystery in the Rift.

Good luck searching the Void, simulacrae (and anyone else daring the 55 KLY journey). I went out there about a year ago to survey a sector called Phaa Chrie, as I thought it might have been a reference to 'Far Cry' or perhaps the cry of sirens... . I never found anything relevant but there are certainly some pretty impressive sights to see out on the Rim.

Thanks! Ya not really expecting anything - I figured it was about time i wandered out this way... Was kind of working off of the hunch that as the codex and the galactic regions came about at the same time - the references in the codex might relate to the regions. But so far my personal journey has not included any hot sirens.
