I wonder if that was in relation to high grade emissions - people did used to think going straight up/down was a good way of finding them.
This video was made prior to 2.1 coming out, so there were no High Grade signal sources back then (no manufactured materials, you could only get raw materials and use them in synthesis - 2.1 was when Engineering was introduced).

I think he was referring to worlds in highly inclined orbits, which can sometimes be 'captured' worlds not a part of the original system and which might be a different type of world than those created in the system. (e.g. You do see occasionally a HMC world as the most distant planet after a string of icy worlds and find that its orbit is highly inclined - it was probably captured).
