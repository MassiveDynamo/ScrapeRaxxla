I remember this one. It was when he was a guest on one of the Thursday evening livestreams with Ed Lewis, whom I think was exploring near Sgr A* / the Galactic Core at the time. I think he might also have made the comment about the infinite range of the ADS making things a bit too easy in the same livestream.

Ah that could explain why I couldnt google it, but I tend not to watch livestreams so I suspect he also said it in one of the Canonn/UA threads. Will try another search. Would be interested if you can find the source compadr√©!
