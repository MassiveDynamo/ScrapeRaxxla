I think they kept the Elite requirement as well, in the way that the Dark Wheel (group) holds a key part of the puzzle.
I donâ€™t think the TDW part is accesible yet, even for Elites.

The other option is that Raxxla or a key part is in Shin Dez.

Anything else would contradict the idea that only a small group of humans knows how to get there.
Except that Ryder wasn't Elite when he was accepted by TDW, he was Dangerous.
Of course there is someone at Shinrata who will only deal with you once you're Dangerous.
