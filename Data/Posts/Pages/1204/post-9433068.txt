You need to be Elite to gain permit to Shin Dez because Jameson is the only station in the whole galaxy where you can buy every ship and every module. It is a reward for becoming Elite that you don't have to fly around bubble looking for ships and/or modules anymore
It is the only known gate in the game that requires Elite (or founder) status. Itâ€™s been there since the gamma release.
Any lazy progrmer would put Raxxla there.
