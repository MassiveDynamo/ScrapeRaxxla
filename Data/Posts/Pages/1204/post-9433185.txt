SPOILER: AFAIK THOSE SYSTEMS FROM ORIGINAL ELITE ARE IN ED:




































This information is without guarantee
I've been to quite a few of these systems. Some seem to be name only eg Aona Waterworld in Elite and mentioned in TDW but there isn't even a planet in ED.
Edit; I've now been to all of them. Aona, Erlaza, Leoned, Qube, Qucerere, Qutiri and Tibionis are just stars. Isinor of course requires a permit.
