I think they kept the Elite requirement as well, in the way that the Dark Wheel (group) holds a key part of the puzzle.
I donâ€™t think the TDW part is accesible yet, even for Elites.

The other option is that Raxxla or a key part is in Shin Dez.

Anything else would contradict the idea that only a small group of humans knows how to get there.
You need to be Elite to gain permit to Shin Dez because Jameson is the only station in the whole galaxy where you can buy every ship and every module. It is a reward for becoming Elite that you don't have to fly around bubble looking for ships and/or modules anymore
