Ah! but!

We dont know that Holdstock’s Raxxla is now canon (§)

And there was nothing to stop DB/MB placing Raxxla into the gamma anywhere in the 400 billion systems in-game, including in the “beta pill”. It could have been placed totally randomly. However I suspect they both are keen on the lore (despite much of it having been retconned circa 2017, for reasons undisclosed), therefore I think they will have had a lore-based reason for placing Raxxla (MB is/was an author so I think he would have pressured for it to make sense in-game.

So I still think Raxxla is in or near Sol based on the lore we still have:

(§) N.B. I have a niggle, not with Han_Zen, but with other posts . It’s to do with misusage of English language in this forum :

=a big gun, for shooting projectiles.
= (1) a collection of rules or texts that are considered to be authoritative (the definition often applied in this thread!)
= a group of players of Elite Dangerous (contraction of “Canonn Interstellar Research Group”)

They sound the same, but have quite different meanings

Holdstock’s Raxxla is not canon but it was all FD had, when they planned this. It would be an odd choice to make a Raxxla that directly contradicts The Dark Wheel.
It’s not like there is a lot. It’s basically: Ghost planet, alien construct, not Cirag, not in this galaxy.

They seem to have kept the construct (omphalos rift) and possibly the ghost planet (obfuscated on the outer rim).
It is easy to avoid a handfull of systems, to stay true to TDW.
