Well I think they are known as the core systems - but ya not the “center” of the old Elite Galaxy1 …. Hmmmmm looks like something fun to play with though
They are known as ‘’the old worlds’ or ‘the Lave cluster’.
The core in ED is big. It includes Achenar, Sol, Alioth and all the highly populated systems around them. Outside the core, we have the frontier systems. Smaller population on the edge of the main human bubble.
