It is the only known gate in the game that requires Elite (or founder) status. Itâ€™s been there since the gamma release.
Any lazy progrmer would put Raxxla there.
The only Elite requirement in the game, has everything purchasable at a discount, every known material for engineering within the planets etc...tbh it wouldn't surprise me if it was Raxxa as FDEV are being very lackluster as it is
