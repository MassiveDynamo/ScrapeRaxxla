from the FFE/FFE2 Old games wiki.....anyone notice a pattern, each of the eight galaxys layed out with the Thargoids in the center resembling the Raxxla logo, The 9th galaxy is missing, which would a sector in Elite and location of Raxxla/The Thargoid center? I know this has 8 sides but still looks a very promising hint maybe?
