SPOILER: AFAIK THOSE SYSTEMS FROM ORIGINAL ELITE ARE IN ED:




































This information is without guarantee

Ya i played around with this a bit last night
Used the list the thread 'Systems from Elite (1984) in Elite Dangerous'
Got the coordinates from the Galaxy 1 and did an overlay with their Elite Dangerous locations… doesnt really translate. 1984 elite lacks a ‘z’ axis so spreads them out more… in ED looks like they did a relative distance … so most are in a nice bubble…. There are a few outliers though … like Ra.
