Mmm,
I agree that in the beginning they would likely have been heavily influenced by Holdstock’s story for the placement of Raxxla.

ghost planet->stealthed planet undetectable by sensors-> possible planet (or dwarf-planet/asteroid)-sized ark ship (likely Guardians, but possibly Thargoids)
Outer rim of what? Dont think its the Milky Way (think its a lot closer than that as per previous lore-based reasoning post), might be outer rim of a system (I suspect Sol, or one close by), or an asteroid belt (where is Ceres??), or was it a coincidence that the spiky-haired woman in Premonition said TDW in Shinrarta are the/on the “outer rim”?

Of course alien artefact on Mars doesnt have to mean Raxxla is in Sol, could be they left/dropped it there before carrying on to somewhere nearby, such as Shinrarta....if the PF is based on the Guardian AI (as per the triangular motif on nav panel) and PF are based in Shinrarta...there may be a good reason that SD is locked to elite...
HZ you forgot to mention one other thing from Holdstock...
“One thing's for sure,' Rafe went on drily. 'Unless you get there, unless you become élite, you'll never get to Raxxla.”

I was thinking about outer rim too and outer rim of a system is a big possibility. Could be hidden somewhere in deep space. Maybe something like Hutton Orbital. You would have to spot is with your naked eye moving on skybox background while you fly in supercruse speed
