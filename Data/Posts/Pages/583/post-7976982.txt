Experiment results....

I charged on the 4th Neutron

Then I charged on Neutrons 2 & 3 AT THE SAME TIME!

Then I charged on Neutron 1, as shown in previous post. This one orbits the BH.
The I flew directly into this...

Nothing. So I tried flying through the diamond...

Again nothing, BUT...

...If it turns out that Raxxla is "the journey", then THIS will be my own, personal Raxxla...
Reactions:
Zaroca, rOmiLaYu, Backelaer and 14 others
