2 hours later and no more word from PeteACarter...he must have made it

Lie is a strong word and will affect how you feel if/when Raxxla isnt in the game...it likely isn't again. Its better to think of it as a Treasure Hunt for a mythical place, which it is really, and therefore may not even exist at all, a lot of the fun is in the seeking and the mystery.

It would help if DB didn't say 'What a silly question, of course it exists' in the same way I'd say to a 5 year old 'What a silly question, of course Santa Clause exists'.

I'm heading down the track of ignoring the toast as a red herring for the moment, or at least nothing that will give me insight until I have further information, so am looking at everything else in the Codex as maybe a hint rather than a clue. Enough people are on the toast, ill look at something else.

I'm back on the trail of maybe believing it will have something to do with Lave and the old worlds. At least a connection. Buoyed up by finding this week an undiscovered system 159 LY from Sol. So this theory that everywhere has been 'explored' within 1000 LY of Sol let alone actually explored meaning mapping is nonsense. Most of it was scan n jump to get the name tagged.

Lets assume 'we know why people haven't been able to find it' is accurate, that could simply mean the same as DW answer to the question 'Can anybody find it (the FR mystery)?' DW replied 'Depends who goes looking'. Implication you need special equipment or something, reality just means, depends if the person looks in the right place or how well they search. If they scan and jump, probably not.

So DB statement could simply mean the same, 'People haven't scanned the system or explored it / mapped the planet / been near it in system yet', all equal, we know why people haven't been able to find it, without any mystery. Mind you so does, 'its not there'.
