IMAGINAL NETWORK HEIST
M.C.S

The recent theft has been reported of two priceless works of art. The 'Imaginal Network' by [OoL1([FmL2,[FfL2), a multi-dimensional image made in the 'new conceptual' school of thought was removed from the Gallery of the Locational Arts Trust at [SyL3(A) while, in a second raid on the same night, the K'tion's 'Contemporate Method' was stolen from the Institute of Critical Art at Wicca's World.

Both raids carry the hallmark of a well-organised group and both undoubtedly had inside information - in the [SyL3(A) theft, the multi-layered alarm system had been deactivated while on Wicca's World, a simultaneous raid by supposed eco-terrorists caused every alarm in the Station to activate so the one at the Gallery was ignored until long after the thieves had departed.

Spokes beings for both sides have commented on the value of the pieces and their remarkable similarity in conceptual terms, supporting the theory that the theft of both was commissioned for a private collection.»
