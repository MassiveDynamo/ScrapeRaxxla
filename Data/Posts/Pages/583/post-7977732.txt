I was thinking over breakfast today that since the Winking Cat is in galnet, and fluff has been removed from galnet, that it must be meaningful. But what makes you think itâ€™s TDW?

Certainly sounds like a double M-type system, but why ELW orbiting both?

Could be worth pulling up the old galnet posts on Winking Cat activities!

I just assumed they chose to finish off the fluff stories they'd already started.
