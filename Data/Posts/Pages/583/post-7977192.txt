I'm back on the trail of maybe believing it will have something to do with Lave and the old worlds. At least a connection. Buoyed up by finding this week an undiscovered system 159 LY from Sol. So this theory that everywhere has been 'explored' within 1000 LY of Sol let alone actually explored meaning mapping is nonsense. Most of it was scan n jump to get the name tagged.

I'm in the same boat as you actually. I've noticed that all of my markers line up with systems above Lave (if viewed from the "southern" hemisphere of Raxxla, hypothetically) So Im exploring that 90ly "Galaxy 1" range, starting with the rarest stars and working down. Even if the toast is a red herring, maybe I'll luck out with the other!
