The Winking Cat is back, this time actually returning something:

I feel that this is another clue for us to follow, not just fluff. The clue here is not the name of the returned painting, as that's consolidating what has already been suggested, to me. It is the name of the painter, in particular their initials. M.M. There was a painting previously stolen by WC that was called (at least a part of the title) Two Circles and I wondered before if those might be referring to the primary stars of a system. If that hunch was right, then this might be narrowing it down to two M stars. That means I'm looking for an Earth-like World orbiting a pair of M stars. Fairly close to the Bubble, though otherwise I'm not sure what heading I'd have to take, given that the Milky Way could have a million worlds like that.

I don't think the Winking Cat is guiding people to Raxxla but I mention it here because I do think there's a chance that it might be a way of extending an invitation to candidate members of The Dark Wheel. If that is the case, then it is a lead worth following up.

I was thinking over breakfast today that since the Winking Cat is in galnet, and fluff has been removed from galnet, that it must be meaningful. But what makes you think itâ€™s TDW?

Certainly sounds like a double M-type system, but why ELW orbiting both?

Could be worth pulling up the old galnet posts on Winking Cat activities!
