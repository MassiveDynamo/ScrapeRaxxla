I just assumed they chose to finish off the fluff stories they'd already started.
I can understand them finishing off the cultural festival but there was no need for them to put out another Winking Cat incident if it was just fluff. If that was the case they could have pulled it and saved themselves the hassle of publishing it. No one would have missed it or known there was supposed to have been one there.

The Winking Cat series has been going on a while and is not just a single Galnet article. That doesn't mean it's automatically not fluff (though I'm surprised that so many Cultural Festival articles are there, unless their sole purpose was to set up the latest Winking Cat episode). It would surprise me if FD put out another fluff piece that does not connect to anything but other fluff pieces after the Gan Romero situation - which connected potentially to Halsey's visions which is a higher-profile part of ED's storyline.

The 'Imaginal Network Heist' from the 3250's is interesting as the m.o. is the same. I wonder if Wicca's World has a Tourist Beacon nearby that mentions it.
