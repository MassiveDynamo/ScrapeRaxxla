Judging by how rapidly the ED community solves problems/puzzles in game and we're now on 588 pages of interesting theories, ideas, conclusions and general all round tin foil hat-ery and we're still no closer to finding raxxla I'm becoming more convinced it's not in the game(yet) and the codex entry is nothing but a lie to keep us looking because as long as we're looking we're in game which is all FDev want. I do hope tho that the next post in this thread is some one saying I've found it

That's why there aren't any clues.
