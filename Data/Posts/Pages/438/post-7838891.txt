Has anyone noticed that when you fly out near the Horsehead Nebula and/or Col 70, the hyperspace tunnel starts spiraling rapidly around you? Spiraling stars?
YES VERY MUCH SO! I just spent 3 days out past rigel, in the Orion nebula and then Barnard's loop area and then 900lyto the left(if facing the Sanguineous Rim border) I noticed it because I thought it was some kind of lag at first.

I noticed the whole border of the Sanguineous Rim in that area is blocked off by permit zones, either cool 70 sectors or horsehead darks. Is really irritated as it kept me from completing my tour of the Orion constellation. But those spinning fs jumps stopped before I got back to rigel on my way back to the bubble
