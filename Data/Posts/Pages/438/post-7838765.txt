With no disrespect to those who dislike the FSS/DSS combo, I suspect the introduction of this mechanism was to enable players to 'find' things - something the ADS was seriously lacking in (unless the player was prepared to spend an indefinite amount of searching time for something that may not even exist... Hmm a bit like Raxxla ), so being 'given' a 'discovery' mechanism to unearth things that had been in the game for years yet unfound seems a reasonable step.

I've been quietly following this thread, and its spin-offs, for a while and enjoying the content. I just wish to point out (which must have been noticed) that the FSS/DSS & Codex were introduced together - is there a link?

@Scytale - shame you are not playing, your input here has been very thought provoking!
@DrewCarnegie - apart from loving the penguin - good input from you too, despite you loathing the new system
