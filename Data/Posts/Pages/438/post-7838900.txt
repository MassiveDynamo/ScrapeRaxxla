That i noticed and followed it tru...
im at the Col 70 atm, been going along the permit locked areas and checking the immediate systems and have found cool stuff, and interesting things, but since u cant go into those areas... Cant follow up on what ive seen or suspect, wich is a shame, the game sudendly becomes interesting but i cant continue...

Other stuff is that on that region there is parts u hear strange noises too when u hyperspace that beats me what it means, but i would speculate it means something...

Ive done so far... 700+ jumps in this region alone!
So u can guess the amount of data i got from this small area of space alone to turn in already...

Will continue to go along the side of the permit locked areas scanning and mapping, till i decide to lose the economic route planning and go straight and fast to the nearest station.
