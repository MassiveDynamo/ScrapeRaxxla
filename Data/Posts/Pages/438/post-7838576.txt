I was under the impression they were replaced by a different set of missions offered by the Dark Wheel... the wording was less intriguing but they are unique to the dark wheel. I haven't checked for them recently, but definitely remember them.
It would be great if you could find a reference to this different set of TDW missions. Not playing for months, but I spent like a year doing missions for TDW exclusively and never saw any out of common after E/F missions disappeared...
