I just wanted to say I don't understand all the Elite bashing. Whilst I appreciate the game might not be everybody's cup of tea, for those it does appeal too, I think FD have done/are doing a damb fine job! I personally think Elite is seriously under rated.

Yes, I would love a few more mysteries/stories, but I'm not convinced there are not more of these that we have been to lazy to uncover. Random example, but the Thetis...how many of us read the data at the Thetis, and then plotted a course 15lys back towards Sol, and had a really good search for the planet sending out the kill signal? There are at least dozens of other examples I could cite aa well.

Maybe FD have been focusing on in-game mechanics before storytelling, to make the mysteries more compelling when we play them. I am personally hoping that Gan Romero is the start of this, now we have FSS, etc (which personally I don't mind now I'm used to it). It would make sense for FD to start doing this now, to keep people's interest, whilst many wait for 2020.
