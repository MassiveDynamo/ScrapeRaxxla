Yeah.. It's me. I just can't stomach that dull, 90's-ish chore FSS-minigame.
If you want players to find "things"... just put them in the game, and in a sensible and consistent way. They'll find them. They already proved it.
But for that, you need to have a real story teller. No need of technically ultra-competent computer engineers with a serious lack of creative fantasy ( who, btw, were told to insert some well known derelict on a travel line and it ended lying dozens of Ly away, with no ELW that was supposed (the story line) to be there...)
