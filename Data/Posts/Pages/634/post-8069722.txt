Shoulder healing nicely, able to play again (but even less capable in combat than previously). Spent yesterday void opal mining to increase my trade rank. Got Entrepreneur & sort of enjoyed it, but keep running out of prospector limpets tagging each possible asteroid. Might spend another day or two on this before resuming my Quest...

Sounds like you need a fighter pilot, someone reliable. And I need credits. Fixed beam lasers or multicannons preferred.

I think there is a story being told in these shapes. Even the blind flying creatures understand them. Sometimes I wonder how things appear in their dimension.
