Check the cables. The smart cat may have used them to tie down the silly dog !

Nothing smart about the cat, unless she was trying to stop my gameplay!
Got into game after a reboot, no obvious cause of this morning’s problems. Happily void opal mining this afternoon, just collecting the last few (had found two adjacent deep core asteroids) and had a transaction server error code “Black Adder”. Weird!
In anticipation of the pirate attacks on my delivery run I powered down the mining gear, but found the hard way that depowering the refinery loses all contents of the bins. Bah, had seven full of opals!
