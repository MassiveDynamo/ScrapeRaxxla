Right Ascension X, X Left Ascension.... But, From Where?

Hutton Orbital, Shinrarta Dezhra, Lave, Leesti?
RIght Ascension and Declination are like longitude and latitude on earthâ€™s skybox.
Any planet could in theory have their own version.

There is no Left Ascension because the Sun and the stars rise to the right, when facing north.

Planets that rotates in the oposite direction, would probably have Left Ascension. In ED these have >90deg. Axial tilt.
Venus is like that.
