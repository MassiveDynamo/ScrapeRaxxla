Anything happening with FD? gamed happily yesterday. Today it won't start or connect to server. Tried to verify files & it's re-syncing. No sign that I can see of any update today. Weird!

And my NordVPN seems to have stopped working too. Done two virus scans (negative).
Edit: game re-downloaded. Still wonâ€™t connect to FD servers. Bah, may have to do some gardening!!!
