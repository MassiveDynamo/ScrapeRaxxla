Did Adam Bourke-Waite confirm they were no longer in-game? All I remember is him saying he thought they were in during a Q&A. I remember someone prodding FD about this (my terrible memory!)

With military convoys reported to be in Witchâ€™s Reach (patch notes history), which implies a hidden permit giver and associated gameplay, I suspect Shinrarta E/F may be still in game but sequenced to be a later part of the journey...FD may have made Raxxla harder to find than it was in the original gamma release.

Shoulder healing nicely, able to play again (but even less capable in combat than previously). Spent yesterday void opal mining to increase my trade rank. Got Entrepreneur & sort of enjoyed it, but keep running out of prospector limpets tagging each possible asteroid. Might spend another day or two on this before resuming my Quest...
