Thought about using Voice attack? - you can set up a macro to do the recording for you without having to let go of the HOTAS. Pretty sure it has a trial license so you could try it with no risk.

Couple it with a HCS Voicepack and you can give the hands more of a rest all of the time with one of the Elite profiles....

I bought them when I was playing with VR and carried on using it when I use the HOTAS, can't recommend it enough.
