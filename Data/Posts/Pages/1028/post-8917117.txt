Except when you mistake the Night vision for the Green glow as I did.

A few seconds of excitement ensued...

No problem! I’m the one who only managed to capture four or five videos of the green glow in a month’s searching!
I did encounter one good example so in my excitement set video recording going then did a capture of the last 5 minutes video, only to find nothing showing on the video recording (too late to get the glow) & the last 5 minutes capture only started when I’d started to video recording so clearly it reset the video buffer! You live and learn!

Edit: but I keep noticing that “detected new signal source” keeps cropping up on the info panel when I’m in the right area. If you drop into normal space that seems to be usually when a SAR ship appears. I wonder if this is another clue and we have to honk within a short time/near distance of that signal detection to get the glow instancing??
