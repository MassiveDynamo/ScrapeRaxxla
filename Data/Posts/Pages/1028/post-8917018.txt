There's definitely something not right with sol though which is odd given its hand crafted and arguably the one system they would want to get right. I'm left thinking it's working as intended, which does make it strange.

I spent a couple of hours yesterday mooching and honking around the belt zone especially the area where the cluster appears, alas no green. I got bored and went back to trying to get into witch's reach. Oddly there's a couple of systems nearby called haghole and frog, if only I could find puppy dog tails I'd be all set.

I'm always messing with game mechanics, the things you would normally do... was trying to fly in to Sol yesterday or see if anything unusual happened as I couldn't scan it, the day before I tried jumping to a system whilst in the jet cone of a neutron star... thought trying to jump whilst operating beyond safety limits might cause a miss-jump, it didn't ;-)

I'm struggling to find the asteroid clusters in Sol, never been a great explorer (my last of the 3 Elite ratings!) - any tips?
