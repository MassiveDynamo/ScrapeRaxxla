There's definitely something not right with sol though which is odd given its hand crafted and arguably the one system they would want to get right. I'm left thinking it's working as intended, which does make it strange.

I spent a couple of hours yesterday mooching and honking around the belt zone especially the area where the cluster appears, alas no green. I got bored and went back to trying to get into witch's reach. Oddly there's a couple of systems nearby called haghole and frog, if only I could find puppy dog tails I'd be all set.

The green glow hunt is extremely frustrating & boring; typical FD RNG!
Edit: itâ€™s partly why I think there is definitely something there! If it was a bug or graphics Artefact I think it would occur more frequently!!
But then I spent a long time chasing after the anomalies in the system map of various stars with Han_Zen who first reported them on the thread!
