the other night while watching a stream on twitch, I saw a player get hyperdicted. thing was the goids did not leave after. they stayed about 400 meters from his ship. like they were waiting for something. he passed it off as a bug, but after unlocking the guardian fsd booster last night, I remembered finding a guardian casket. since the goids like escape pods, has anyone tried giving the casket to a goid ship?

maybe they will give us something in return that will guide us to raxxla?
