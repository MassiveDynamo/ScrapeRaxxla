the other night while watching a stream on twitch, I saw a player get hyperdicted. thing was the goids did not leave after. they stayed about 400 meters from his ship. like they were waiting for something. he passed it off as a bug, but after unlocking the guardian fsd booster last night, I remembered finding a guardian casket. since the goids like escape pods, has anyone tried giving the casket to a goid ship?

maybe they will give us something in return that will guide us to raxxla?

Goids don’t seem to like anything Guardian. You should try to give them the casket, but I expect you’ll just get a quick death. Goid behaviour after a hyperdiction seems more variable than it used to. A while ago I was hyperdicted by 3 Interceptors, but turned off FA and boosted away just before their EMP blast so got to a safe distance. They hung around for a while before disappearing.
