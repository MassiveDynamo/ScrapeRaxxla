My ultimate view is that this cannot be found through intelligence or logic - that you need to be the 'max pointer', the creme de-la creme of Elite V top-notch. Otherwise, forget it.
Of course it can. People were unwilling to even entertain that Elite Classic could be part of the lore. NEWSFLASH: Lakon Spaceways per codex is from Earth. Lavian Brandy is made in oak barrels from Earth. They simply excluded it from the map because it couldn't be rendered at the time and used a lore excuse. The problem largely is that people either through lack of confidence and fear of failure won't go looking or they believe people who loudly proclaim nothing prior is remotely reliable. Sure systems have been obscured by name changes over the centuries and especially once we got Universal Cartographics - but planets, stations, and ports names largely didn't change.


Present iteration is known as Lakon Spaceways Type-6 Transporter



The other problem is there is a absolute ton of propaganda in the lore and CMDRs seem to think this is a normal game where everything is taken at face value. No, you have read descriptions everywhere and go look for yourself and make up your mind as to what is real and what is misdirection. The problem is this is not a normal video game. The lore is weaponized against CMDRs. There are a lot of dubious characters and groups you should be highly suspicious of whatever they say. Salom√© was not kidding about trust no one. The other thing is like the gazetteer and journals in Frontier and First Encounters both use the Federal naming scheme as well as Imperial. Then everything changed because of Universal Cartographics. A Raxxla hunter must be a detective and use clues from the past to piece together the present. This is why Church of the Path is in the Shibboleth system.
