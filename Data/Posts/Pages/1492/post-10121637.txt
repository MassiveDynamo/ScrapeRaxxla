We know the location of the first Coriolis and who designed it (Vetitice). Veliaze is not just a rumor (go to Zelada). Oltiqu has a glorious history of the interplay between the Federation and a group of rebels (you've probably been there if you've been through the Alliance territory). If you haven't, search GalMap for Hope. Jones Colony, Essafa was ultimately found.

There are a great many reasons to have hope.
