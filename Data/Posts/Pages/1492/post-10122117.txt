. A Raxxla hunter must be a detective and use clues from the past to piece together the present. This is why Church of the Path is in the Shibboleth system.
Was fun looking at that- I think Maarg is the Shibboleth. Marg in Hindi is way or road .. Path. Also Marg could be short for Margaret / Margarite …. Pearl

So disciples of Maarg could be disciples of the Path or Disciples of the Pearl…. Oisr…. Saramandaras Pearls…. Raxxla!
