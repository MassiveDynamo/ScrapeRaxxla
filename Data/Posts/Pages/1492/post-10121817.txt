We know the location of the first Coriolis and who designed it (Vetitice). Veliaze is not just a rumor (go to Zelada). Oltiqu has a glorious history of the interplay between the Federation and a group of rebels (you've probably been there if you've been through the Alliance territory). If you haven't, search GalMap for Hope. Jones Colony, Essafa was ultimately found.

There are a great many reasons to have hope.
And that is why I keep coming here - because you folks are awesome. It's just my own personal journey stopped for this.

Don't get me wrong - perhaps Raxxla is available to 'anyone' - I hope it is. Yet there's another cynical side to me that thinks that it's locked behind 'progress'. Until Raxxla is found, none of us will truly know. To be honest, this is one of the last places I come for my daily tinfoil!

Keep up the fantastic work, CMDRs! (Not like you need me to say it!) All of your efforts I believe are testament to what makes Elite: Dangerous 'Elite'.
