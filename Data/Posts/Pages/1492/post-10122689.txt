But where does the path originate, one needs more than 1 sign post in space to establish a route! Any other systems attributed here?

Currently working up enough effort to plot/map all stations attributed to the names Arcadia / Delphi, not that many relatively, shouldn’t take long (once I get going), likely irrelevant but might be fun!

Ya i went and looked at the Shibboleth system. It has a planet Haven orbited by a moon called Kyllikki… which is a character from the Kalevala… but not sure how they tie in with Shibboleth. Usually there is some relationship.

Reading a bit about the Kalevala there is the Sampo… which seems to fit the description of world pillar as well as trinket of fortune…

I like the arcadia - delphi mapping idea.
