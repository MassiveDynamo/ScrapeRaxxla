ton of propaganda in the lore
And in-game also as we see now with the conflict between the Fed corpo rats and the filthy Empire senate.
In this case it is nearly certain the Empire was framed so the Fed could get away with a political murder, the implication of which we will learn about later.
The unbalanced rewards to draw player to one side or the other is part of the narrative, but the players largely ignore that and simply follow their short-term, near-sighted interest.
As Fdev stated "everyone is roleplaying, even unknowingly"
Maybe we don't get Raxxla or TDW because we don't deserve it, as a player base. Too busy with animal instincts, amassing credits like ants and grain, killing each other & shooting at aliens on sight (fun to see people recriminating against Fdev for the Thargoid war, when humanity started this war through player actions: again, privileging short term benefits, meta-alloys and boasting about killing aliens.
