Well, Im getting really frustrated and annoyed with this game!
Reread AHTW on the hypothesis that TDW may have taken over the CIEP orbis station...
BUT
LTT 2771 is supposed to have the Smuggler’s Junction pirate asteroid base, but not an asteroid in sight in that system in-game!! Also planet 1 is Tarlak,
But Tarlak is supposed to be the garbage planet in CD-73 253 where Gunn dumped Robert after stealing the data from the CIEP station. However CD-73 253 in- game has no planet, even though the system description talks about it having the garbage planet!

Ths really puts me off. If FD can’t be bothered to set up correctly and check the systems discussed in their sponsored novels and their own system descriptions then I have no faith in their ability to fulfill either TDW or Raxxla promises!
FD might think these objects are in-game, but such poor quality control makes me doubtful!

If the in-game systems had matched the novel storyline then I was going to suggest that the CIEP fleet might not have originated in Soontill (which is well off the straight-line path from Brohman to their target at Delta Phoenecis) but might have staged from the system with their orbis station. Just follow the straight line path back from those two systems and check all the red dwarf systems for the GG with the station. There are a lot in that region!

Also Robert was supposed to be unconscious for a day or so after the CIEP station escapade, plus an unknown duration of time before Gunn dumped him on the garbage planet. However it took her 7 days to make the 19 jumps for the 119 ly trip from Epsilon Eridani to Vequess. So her ship jump range was around 6.5 ly and she could only make 2 or 3 jumps in a day, which should define a shell of probability for the CIEP station location from CD-73 253.
