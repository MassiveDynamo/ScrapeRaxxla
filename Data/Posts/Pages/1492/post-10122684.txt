Do you know if extensive research of the tourist's beacons has been conducted?
I wonder if some pieces of information could surface on these logs. Events, places, persons...
Im slowly getting through them all, however as i have only been here a couple of years its taking time to catch up.
Seen some wonderful sights though and trying to concentrate on anything remotely referenced to our cause.
