1491 pages on this topic? Wow. Don't waste your time until Raxxla gets added to the game and it's not going to be added until FDevs get some content ready
TBH, your sig. says x6 Elite V - in which case, I believe (with no foundation) that you actually have more chance than most of finding Raxxla than anyone else without such credentials.

Considering the 'effort' - which some would assume to be minimal - of (for example) obtaining a G5 suit, I highly doubt any rogues such as myself with no Elite V rankings - would be able to find it. 'We' tried in the early days but after almost 10 years I have to admit it's worn thin. Can't give an exact date, but I reckon I gave up sometime around 4 years ago.

I come here mainly in the hope of finding news on the subject.

My ultimate view is that this cannot be found through intelligence or logic - that you need to be the 'max pointer', the creme de-la creme of Elite V top-notch. Otherwise, forget it.

Prove me wrong. PLEASE prove me wrong!
