Do you know if extensive research of the tourist's beacons has been conducted?
I wonder if some pieces of information could surface on these logs. Events, places, persons...
There has but there is a twist like with GalNet - player generated lore. That said Antares Incident, Starship One, and several other players generated GalNets got us to our current understanding of events. I also would not rule out FDev employees being some of the CMDRs responsible for some of the beacons.
