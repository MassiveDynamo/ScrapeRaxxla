Are these books supposed to be canon?
They might give ideas and perspectives but my conviction is that Dangerous is self-contained.
Then where do you get Raxxla. You kind of need Holdstock and all the books even prior to the first game to even have a basis for the myth. "And Here the Wheel" had a Y-class dwarf in Soontill. There is no such body. Also, I would say destroying Soontill 1 might be a tiny bit difficult given the insane atmosphere pressure, heat, etc. Yes, the weapon was like a Star Wars Superlaser but pretty sure the beam wouldn't survive interaction with the atmosphere especially with silicates and iron being the dominant components. It would be like aiming the Death Star at a giant planet sized mirror or a giant diffraction device.

You'd essentially nullify the beam's destructive force:
