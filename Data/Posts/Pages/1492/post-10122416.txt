Was fun looking at that- I think Maarg is the Shibboleth. Marg in Hindi is way or road .. Path. Also Marg could be short for Margaret / Margarite …. Pearl

So disciples of Maarg could be disciples of the Path or Disciples of the Pearl…. Oisr…. Saramandaras Pearls…. Raxxla!
But where does the path originate, one needs more than 1 sign post in space to establish a route! Any other systems attributed here?

Currently working up enough effort to plot/map all stations attributed to the names Arcadia / Delphi, not that many relatively, shouldn’t take long (once I get going), likely irrelevant but might be fun!
