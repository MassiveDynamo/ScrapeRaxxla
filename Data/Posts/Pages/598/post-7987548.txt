Do you guys dss atmospheric planets? I did for a while but they seem to be worthless if they've already been mapped
I scan only water/earth-like if not scanned by others + 8th around giants always. Also may scan anything not scanned yet just to put my name on some popular routes.
Last month got a habit open map and count objects If it matches to FSS pulse and everything seems visited, I just skip, don't even FSS. Also always open FSS screen and check left side of bar for steady signals present even if pulse says "stars only".
