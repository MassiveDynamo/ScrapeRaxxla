Offtop a bit ...

Did anybody try stream PC screen left-right 3D split to smartphone "google cardboard" ? Is it any viable ? I'm thinking to write programs / buy phone (as I don't have it for 2 years). Just feel like I want VR after started to use Krait Phantom instead Conda
Problem is ..I dunno how to tell to Elite gyroscope data from phone so it could track. Seems like need to do "fake" device/driver...
When I first saw "Cardboard" it seemed like a great entry level (cheap) VR alternative but thinking about it a little harder it dawned on me that having a microwave transmitter strapped to your face at some optimal distance set by a company such as Google / Alphabet could have extremely bad consequences.

Their reputation is rapidly sliding into a deep hole and Google is no longer your friend / trustworthy.

[Edit: Maybe if the phone was in "Aeroplane mode" and you could trust it NOT to transmit...]
[Edit, edit: Despite the inconvenience I flat refuse to use any hardware that's not hardwired.]
