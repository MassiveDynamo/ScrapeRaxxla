When I first saw "Cardboard" it seemed like a great entry level (cheap) VR alternative but thinking about it a little harder it dawned on me that having a microwave transmitter strapped to your face at some optimal distance set by a company such as Google / Alphabet could have extremely bad consequences.

Their reputation is rapidly sliding into a deep hole and Google is no longer your friend.

As someone who uses daydream id just like to say... "Google is my friend...Google is my frienddddd" <singsong chant>

On a side note
Where do you normally keep your phone?
