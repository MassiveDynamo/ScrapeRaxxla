I have this annoying "touch it once" OCD that forces me to DSS any and all objects that aren't already shown as mapped the first time I go through them so when I'm trying to get somewhere quickly I can use the "visited systems" filter and reliably assume there's no need to bother searching that system further.

That habit was started prior to the visited systems filter being added though, and if it's an occupied system with a non-compromised nav beacon I'll typically just drop in and scan that to get the full system data instead to save time. I've had Exploration Elite for ages so it's not like I need the cash for it either.

Hopping round the bubble I use the "High Security" filter, as they're typically fully explored already.
I hope your right.....fleet carries not going to be cheap!
