Offtop a bit ...

Did anybody try stream PC screen left-right 3D split to smartphone "google cardboard" ? Is it any viable ? I'm thinking to write programs / buy phone (as I don't have it for 2 years). Just feel like I want VR after started to use Krait Phantom instead Conda
Problem is ..I dunno how to tell to Elite gyroscope data from phone so it could track. Seems like need to do "fake" device/driver...
