"the siren of the deepest void!" - A binary NS system close to Sgr A*?
If you find such a system, record the GalMap & the NS' FSS audio.
No luck so far, but....Dont know if ~1700ly from a* is too far, for what you wanted (??) but just found a field of maybe 5000 NS, in the core, way above the plane....bound to be some NS/NS binaries in here. So far 0 tags as well. Will update...
