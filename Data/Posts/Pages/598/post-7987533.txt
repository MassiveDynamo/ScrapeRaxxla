That's partly why region/system locks are central to my Raxxla and TDW theories. Raxxla being randomly stumbled across by someone who wasn't even looking for it would be hugely disappointing.

Also, from a technical perspective, region/system locks are a long-standing mechanism (present in the game since Raxxla was added) that can be easily tested by FDev without anyone needing to know where Raxxla is. Coding something specifically to obscure Raxxla or the TDW station is an unnecessary extra effort, and runs a risk of breaking whenever new features (eg the FSS) are added. Unlocking permits is the same - there's an existing, easily tested method for doing it.
Yup, keep it simple with a mechanic that has been in the game since the beginning (which purportedly Raxxla has as well). And everyone has to make a personal journey to get their own permit (s). Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed.
