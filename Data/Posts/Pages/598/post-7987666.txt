I'm inclined to agree with this observation. It's one thing for a system to have been semi / fully explored (but not mapped) and present in eddb / inara and all the other external databases since prior to the Horizons release and then have an INRA base retroactively dropped on an airless moon much later with a handwavium "Well, you couldn't land on moons to find it the last time" from FDev.

In theory now they added the FSS / mapping, nothing can hide on any planet, even if we can't land on it.

[Edit: Gets up to make coffee and stumbles head first through a logical perception error and sees an obvious flaw in that argument: If / when the Atmos / Gas Giant patches are added there could be a further locking mechanism that's removed only for those who purchase the upgrade, revealing untold millions of occupied, living and breathing settlements that may not even exist prior to FDev retrofitting that content.]

Isnt there are already permanent POIs that are invisible to FSS. For example, I dont think all crashed ships have POIs do they?
You could also get around it with life if the omphalos rift turns out to be the Martian relic, which was tiny. You could fit it in your hand. How sensitive is the FSS? Could it pick that up?
