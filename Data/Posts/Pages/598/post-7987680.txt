Agreed, VR looks awesome, and is on my bucket list as a nice to have but at the same time, patience is a virtue so I ain't in any massive rush to upgrade the PC for it until I'm fairly confident it's not spying on me while using it and it will be unplugged while idle. Same for any microphone / camera I have control of.

Let some other guinea pig with more money than sense test it to see if it kills them first.
Tech does NOT spy on you. I know this for an absolute fact because Alexa told me.

Edit....I just asked Alexa where raxxla is. Apparently good old "Rax" is a village in Scotland
