I wish I could make my 'head look' button mapped to my PSVR head movement. I'd be so happy to play ED even in fake vr at this point
Agreed, VR looks awesome, and is on my bucket list as a nice to have but at the same time, patience is a virtue so I ain't in any massive rush to upgrade the PC for it until I'm fairly confident it's not spying on me while using it and it will be unplugged while idle. Same for any microphone / camera I have control of.

Let some other guinea pig with more money than sense test it to see if it kills them first.
