This is true. Faraway was probably in use, in GalCop space for some period before 3125. At that point, it was no longer in use.
As a means to increase safety it was probably useful to Galcop, that only controlled a few sectors(galaxies) with a limited number of systems in each.

Hyper space technology is much older than this. Marlin Duval managed to get a fleet of settlers to Achenar, as early as the 2300s. I'm pretty sure they didn't have any Faraway system at that time.

When it comes to Raxxla, I would guess that neither 'a corps of Elites that lives there' nor Jason Ryder were restricted to standard GalCop technology.

Yeah, exactly. And yes, the settling of Achenar in the 2300s is precisely why I wanted to check whether there was a 7ly max jump route to there from Sol.
