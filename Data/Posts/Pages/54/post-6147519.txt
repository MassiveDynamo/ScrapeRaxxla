Great effort, repped! Can I just ask though, is the stuff from Cmdr Faulcon about the crashed ship and records actually real, or just poetic licence? I don't recall those details from earlier in this thread...

Thanks! Faulcon is actually Jaiotu talking about his explorations / theories

So, if I'm reading all this FSD discussion correctly, there's nothing useful that can be inferred from it regarding plausible distances from Sol to Raxxla. Right?

Well, we know that old hyperdrive definitely did go further than 7ly at a time. So that means, technically, the whole galaxy is back in play.... so, really, it makes it worse in terms of searching.
