Well strictly speaking the Faraway system wasn't the hyperdrive system, it was just the first commercially available system. I think this needs to be treated akin to commercial airflight, with air-traffic control etc.

As you say, a misjump could lead to all sorts of complications. From the descriptions in TDW, Faraway seems to be more a method for giving a highly controlled and safe jump route and co-ordinating all the traffic trying to use that route.

This is true. Faraway was probably in use, in GalCop space for some period before 3125. At that point, it was no longer in use.
As a means to increase safety it was probably useful to Galcop, that only controlled a few sectors(galaxies) with a limited number of systems in each.

Hyper space technology is much older than this. Marlin Duval managed to get a fleet of settlers to Achenar, as early as the 2300s. I'm pretty sure they didn't have any Faraway system at that time.

When it comes to Raxxla, I would guess that neither 'a corps of Elites that lives there' nor Jason Ryder were restricted to standard GalCop technology.
