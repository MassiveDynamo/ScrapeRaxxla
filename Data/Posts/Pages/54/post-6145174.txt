So, with the recent discussions around historic jump ranges and where could have been reached, I thought I'd actually do some checking.

Route plotting fails to both Lave and Achenar.

So, barring it being an issue with the route plotter, we can probably safely say that even in the early days of hyperspace there were jump ranges greater than 7 ly.
