So, if I'm reading all this FSD discussion correctly, there's nothing useful that can be inferred from it regarding plausible distances from Sol to Raxxla. Right?

Well, it depends what you considered plausible in the first place. We can infer that very high distances are plausible, but personally I'd already inferred that from other reasoning.

But it definitely means that it could be somewhere that can't be reached with 7ly jump range. - which makes sense in terms of the lore as well.
