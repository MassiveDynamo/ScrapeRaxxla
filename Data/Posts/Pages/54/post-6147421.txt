I did a little piece on Raxxla for our latest issue: http://www.sagittariuseyes.com/issue-3.html Big thanks to CMDR MarcusTheBlack and CMDR DrNoesis from this thread for contributing and others on this thread for general ideas.

Great effort, repped! Can I just ask though, is the stuff from Cmdr Faulcon about the crashed ship and records actually real, or just poetic licence? I don't recall those details from earlier in this thread...
