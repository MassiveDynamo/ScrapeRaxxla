Yeah, exactly. And yes, the settling of Achenar in the 2300s is precisely why I wanted to check whether there was a 7ly max jump route to there from Sol.

So, if I'm reading all this FSD discussion correctly, there's nothing useful that can be inferred from it regarding plausible distances from Sol to Raxxla. Right?
