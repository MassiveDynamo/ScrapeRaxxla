The original Elite's 7 light-year maximum jump range has to be tempered by the fact that we were limited to a single space craft: The Cobra Mk III. It is quite possible that other ships were capable of jumping many times further then that. Some ships back then, including the Sidewinder, weren't even hyperspace capable.

Indeed. And I did say as much in the discussion about hyperspace, but at that point we had nothing to go off other than the 7ly range. Now we know that longer jumps were almost certainly possible. Which has a lot of bearing on the arguments over both the extent of human exploration, and the possible location of Raxxla.
