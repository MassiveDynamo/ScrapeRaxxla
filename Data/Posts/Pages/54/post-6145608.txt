So, with the recent discussions around historic jump ranges and where could have been reached, I thought I'd actually do some checking.

So, I'm currently in Sol with a 7.02ly jump range Sidey.

Route plotting fails to both Lave and Achenar.

So, barring it being an issue with the route plotter, we can probably safely say that even in the early days of hyperspace there were jump ranges greater than 7 ly.

The original Elite's 7 light-year maximum jump range has to be tempered by the fact that we were limited to a single space craft: The Cobra Mk III. It is quite possible that other ships were capable of jumping many times further then that. Some ships back then, including the Sidewinder, weren't even hyperspace capable.
