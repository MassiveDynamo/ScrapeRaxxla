Can you clear something up for us. Is it still speculated that you need to be Elite in the 3 disciplines as part of MB's quote "it's a journey every cmdr must take". And have we found out if djtruthsayer's speculated location of Raxxla came to anything? Cheers chaps.

We only know that we know nothing. Elite rank was a point when the E/F missions were running.
As you say, only speculations. MB is no longer here and the E/F missions stopped. I am not sure there is still a journey to take.
Every time I troll DJ on his Twitch about his famous expedition, he proves very evasive. I don't think he is still in the party. But it's just my humble opinion.
