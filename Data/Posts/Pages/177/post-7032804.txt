DJ, like some others, makes a living (or some of it) by having people speaking of him. I am waiting for somebody to say he has found the Guardians homeworld and is going to marry the Tharg Queen.
CoR zealots had been receiving so much salt that I would'n argue about their current motivations for secretism.
But again, I really don't know. My hunch is all this Quest is on standby and the only " tiny part a little bit obvious" was the E/F missions and TDW faction as long as they lasted.

Edit: AND, of course, all this is still Macros' fault for coming too early too close of solving the Quest !

Of course there is an opposite interpretation- that the DW missions might have been set dressing and nothing to do with the real location of Raxxla, and were pulled because FD realised the amount of salt that would be generated if that came to light. So the only clue we have is MB’s “you have to make it a little bit obvious”. That cannot have changed, so what is obvious, cos we’re missing it.
