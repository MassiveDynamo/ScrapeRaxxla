There is also a couple of small parts in Premonition:
"Their eyes met. Salomé swallowed. ‘A corps of ruthless, power-crazed elitists
hiding behind the scenes. Myths and romantic stories fltering back from the
darkness, planets lost in the void. Exaggerated nonsense, surely?’
Arissa chuckled. ‘Tall tales must start somewhere, no?’
Salomé frowned, ‘You believe in … Raxxla?’
‘No, I don’t,’ Arissa replied. ‘But I believe in the power of misdirection,
confusion and obfuscation. Myths and legends are inhabited by those who
want to direct attention elsewhere. They take the dreamers and the romantics
and use them.’
‘A cloak …"

and

"‘You’ll be telling me Raxxla is real next,’ Tsu scoﬀed.
Luko shrugged. ‘This I do not know, but I think it is more likely to be real
than not. These people, they claimed to know …’
‘Wait,’ Raan couldn’t hold back. ‘Raxxla is a fairy story for children, what
you’re talking about is those crazy stories about the Dark Wheel …’
‘Not the same.’ Luko shook his head. ‘Not the same at all. They need no
names, no identifcation. They just are. As for Raxxla, what better way to hide
it than make it out to be a myth? Only the crazy ones go looking …"

Both are quite vage. They might be interpreted to indicate a link between the Club and Raxxla. That the Club and the 'powerful twisted men' of Raxxla are infact the same?

I think the concern for those on Raxxla is not lone wolves and minor organisations, it is other people and groups with significant influence.

A situation with an alien species provides a rather good distraction for those people/groups does it not?
