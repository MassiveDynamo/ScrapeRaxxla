DJ, like some others, makes a living (or some of it) by having people speaking of him. I am waiting for somebody to say he has found the Guardians homeworld and is going to marry the Tharg Queen.
CoR zealots had been receiving so much salt that I would'n argue about their current motivations for secretism.
But again, I really don't know. My hunch is all this Quest is on standby and the only " tiny part a little bit obvious" was the E/F missions and TDW faction as long as they lasted.

Edit: AND, of course, all this is still Macros' fault for coming too early too close of solving the Quest !
