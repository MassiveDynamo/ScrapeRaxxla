Raxxla is a mythical planet which only appeared in The Dark Wheel novel of Elite.
The Dark Wheel is a faction in Elite: Dangerous, where it is confirmed by DB there is a planet called Raxxla.
The E/F missions, related to The Dark Wheel faction, are the only known reference to a certain celestial body, The Myth.
The E/F missions stopped or are on standby.
For me: period.

Someone might have given DJ a tip, that lead him to inform FD.
This fits with his evasive answers and the fact that he has only reached the Dangerous rank in combat in all these years (Inara) while he constantly says he will set up his expedition as soon as he reaches 3E.
And following his Twitch, he doesn't seem to feel like being in a hurry...
