Hmmmmm

We only know that we know nothing. Elite rank was a point when the E/F missions were running.
As you say, only speculations. MB is no longer here and the E/F missions stopped. I am not sure there is still a journey to take.
Every time I troll DJ on his Twitch about his famous expedition, he proves very evasive. I don't think he is still in the party. But it's just my humble opinion.

Cheers for clarifying.
I thought it likely someone here would have tried to extract as much information out of DJ as possible. I will calm down on grinding out the combat in that case and focus on heading out to my hunch location. *closest stars to Magnaletic clouds.* reachable in game? Who knows!
