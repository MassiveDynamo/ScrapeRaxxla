Of course there is an opposite interpretation- that the DW missions might have been set dressing and nothing to do with the real location of Raxxla, and were pulled because FD realised the amount of salt that would be generated if that came to light. So the only clue we have is MB’s “you have to make it a little bit obvious”. That cannot have changed, so what is obvious, cos we’re missing it.

I don't think there is anything obvious about Raxxla's location.

The only thing that is a little bit obvious, is that Raxxla is in the game. The obvious parts are the not so sutle references in the mission texts.

I anyone has located Raxxla and kept quiet about it, it's probably because it was found illegitimately. There was quite a bit of file snooping going on in the early days. Someone might have given DJ a tip, that lead him to inform FD.
