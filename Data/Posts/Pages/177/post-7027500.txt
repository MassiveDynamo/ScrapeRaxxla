Now I'm back from Colonia thought I'd quickly recheck. The permit locked system is HR 4413, 15 ly from Tchernobog; it's in the navigation panel list but doesn't appear in an EDDB search on permit locked systems near Tchernobog.
So, am I being a little over-suspicious here??? (no, I'm not paranoid, they really are out to get me!).

HR 4413 has 0 population.

Yes, which is frustrating. The fact that there is a permit locked system so close to Shinrarta, with zero population, seems to me to be suggestive, can’t imagine why FD would locate a dev test site there; so maybe there is a storyline explanation, wouldn’t surprise me if the DW missions were eventually going to provide a permit. Or how about that being the Guardian homeworld & Shinrarta is supposed to be one destination of their ark ships? [alien][alien][alien]
