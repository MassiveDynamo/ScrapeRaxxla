Yes, which is frustrating. The fact that there is a permit locked system so close to Shinrarta, with zero population, seems to me to be suggestive, can’t imagine why FD would locate a dev test site there; so maybe there is a storyline explanation, wouldn’t surprise me if the DW missions were eventually going to provide a permit. Or how about that being the Guardian homeworld & Shinrarta is supposed to be one destination of their ark ships? [alien][alien][alien]

HR 4413 has a regular permit that usually is obtainable from one of the factions in the system. With 0 pop. that does not happen. Most likely this is just a small error in the Stellar forge.

On the other hand, the system is also called 'GL 3663'. This fits with the character combination needed to write Raxxla.

G=R
L=L
3=A
6=X

RL AXXA

shuffle -> RAXXLA [haha]
