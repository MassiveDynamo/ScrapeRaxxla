Mama, that BH is making eyes at me...(perhaps you have to be a certain age to remember that song! )

Highest CN star according to EDSM: jewel (Diamond is Carbon!) that burns on the brow of the Mother of Galaxies? It is well above (the brow?) Sag A*!
Jorki went there during DW2, it was one of the optional waypoints. Fantastic sight of the galaxy spread out below. The EDSM entry talks about using it as a base to go upwards, but I couldn’t see anything above it on a quick perusal of the galmap. But possibly going from it to NS/BH (whisperer in witchspace, siren of the deepest void?) nearby (without running out of fuel!!) might fit the DW entrance requirement? Then must get back and sell the data to TDW in SD!
Well, it’s a hypothesis that needs testing and I can do it a little at a time, resting my hands/thumbs as required.
