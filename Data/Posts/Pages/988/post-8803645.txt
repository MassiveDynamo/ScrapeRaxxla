this is genius!
I took the word Raxxla, split it into three chemical elements, took ordinal numbers, it turned out 88 20 57, for each digit I assigned a letter from the alphabet, it turned out hhb _ EG
after that I again turned to the chemical table - it turned out like this O2 He B N
and again turned to the alphabet ... it turned out so 151585214 or 151/585/214.
dead end again, but it was interesting)

The word 'Raxxla' was the invention of Rob Holdstock, and he first used it in the "Alien Worlds" book, long before Elite existed. When writing the Dark Wheel novella, he re-used the name - presumably because he liked it. The "Raxxlan Sector" in that book seems to share no similarities with ED stuff, so unlikely to be relevant other than inspiration for RH.

Its not correct to say that Ryder found evidence for Raxxla in the old worlds. In the Novella, he had been travelling for some time before returning to the galcop worlds:

" 'Jason Ryder was convinced that Raxxla existed. That's why he trained for, and became a part of, the Dark Wheel, the legend-seekers. I hadn't heard much from him or about him for some time until just before he died, when he told me he'd found evidence for the real existence of Raxxla. He came back from
Deep Space to get a proper team together . . . "
