I can now confirm that collecting all known visitor beacons in the codex does not open a portal to Raxxla, lead to an invitation from the DArk Wheel, or indeed do anything other than while away several hundred in-game hours due to circumnavigating the galaxy twice.

Codex completeness, pre-Odyssey:

Abandoned settlements - 10 pages.
Generation ships - 3 pages
Thargoid - 3 pages
Tourist beacons - 22 pages

Kudos to the grand beacon collection folks - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eu30UyjpQrWexAglwD1Ax_GaDz4d7l8KD76kSzX4DEk/edit#gid=0

Big check-list of collectables. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LfRarfcn9jEab-Ix8vxVb77mJG1zMboXf79H4NBWEjY/edit?usp=sharing
