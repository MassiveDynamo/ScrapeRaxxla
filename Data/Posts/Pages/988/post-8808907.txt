Which beacon is that? I did all my mining for Explorer’s Anchorage within a single jump, think it was about 27ly but I was in a 63ly range ship. Seem to remember I got into the top 10%, which was good going in a Phantom, though I did ship out Collector, Prospector, Abrasion blaster, Subsurface missile, etc.

Ah, I have refreshed my (ageing!) memory!! There were two CGs during DW2. Yes, the bulk of the materials for Explorer’s Anchorage were mined during the first CG at the Waypoint 2 system, Omega Sector VE-Q b5-15, when its initial construction was started. Seem to remember I went back to the nearest station to swap out mining fit for exploration fit, though it’s been quite a while now and my memory is not good. The second CG occurred to finish off its construction and provide the necessary services after it had been shipped out to Stuemeae FG-Y d7561. It was nice to see on-site the construction progress to completion. See https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Distant_Worlds_II
It was good fun and I would certainly recommend people do at least one long expedition, though as frequently occurs some murderous psychopaths preyed on a few brave pilots.
