Latest destroyed station in Atropos has a Crashed Ship on A 4. Yet another 'draw' to a system and then theres a little extra thing to find if you look around....happens on a lot of these type things and occasional CGs I notice.....and similar to above Ive considered the passenger missions destinations (or routes....), as well as the Engineers and routes to their 'product' possibly leading to other gameplay...

its all a Jigsaw puzzle, either get involved or dont, entirely optional....but some of it is designed to add together to make that Jigsaw, but how many Jigsaws are there.....its like one of them Dan Brown Illuminati branding irons, its own pattern in itself, but also all fits together to make one bigger Jigsaw

Any new Tip Offs since the update? I haven't seen any posts about it but managed to delete one without reading it yesterday which was just great.
