Received a postcard from Tycho, cheeky whippersnapper!
"Hi Jorki, having fun. Docked in Explorer's Anchorage near Sag A* for a bit of R&R/lavian brandy. About 134 jumps via the Neutron Highway. Expected to see some sign of Sag A* in hyperspace as I jumped past it to this system, it's only 3.6 LY away but no sign-weird.
Found a beacon commemorating the construction of this station during the DW2 expedition. Didn't you say you participated? Can't see your name on the plaque!
Regards
Tycho"
