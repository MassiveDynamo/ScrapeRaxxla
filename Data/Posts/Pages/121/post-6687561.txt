Is it, though? Raxxla is according to "The Dark Wheel" assumed to be a planet. It's not a myth about a planet. At least that's what I got when I read the books.

The most concrete statement that we have about Raxxla is from Rafe Zetter in The Dark Wheel:

'Raxxla's no alien, Alex. It's a ghost world. A planet. A legend . . .'

Unfortunately this concrete is about as solid as Jello because we have no idea what portions of The Dark Wheel novella are canon and which are ... canon fodder. Still ... I'm holding onto Rafe's testimony about what Raxxla is and isn't out of shear necessity. Without Rafe's descriptions of Raxxla there isn't much of anything else to go on.
