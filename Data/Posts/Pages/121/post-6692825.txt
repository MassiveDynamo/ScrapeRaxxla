We broke the thread. So random drive by theory, bits proposed at one time another, entirety probably proposed somewhere in the depths of this or another thread.

Premises
Raxxla exists
Thargoids are aware of Raxxla
Raxxla is or marks the location of some sort of portal
Thargoids use a different form of witch space than humans
Portals are useful if they take you somewhere you can't normally go
Barnacles emblem looks like Magellanic cloud

So somewhere in human space, likely near a backtracked region to Thargoid origination (ie near Pleiades probably) is a portal that will take you to the Magellanic cloud. Even if true it's entirely possible activating or even seeing the portal could require a complex, difficult to deduce combination. Like having a UP in your hold on the first day of the last moon of Autumn on the threshold of Winter.
