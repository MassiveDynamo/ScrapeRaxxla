Will it register as Raxxla once scanned? If not, could you simply pass right by it without even knowing?

When you have sections of space with "unknown permit required", any number of suggested entities could occupy it. They are the unknown, therefore they have the permit. My understanding is that Horsehead was once open for exploration. If so, and someone visited it and didn't scan it, FD would probably know (they said as much). Would they then close it off to prevent anyone else from visiting it since perhaps it's not fully developed?
