Interesting theory but i reject some of your premises, CMDR.

Raxxla exists (Yes, Michael Brooks said so)
Thargoids are aware of Raxxla (We don't know that)
Raxxla is or marks the location of some sort of portal (We don't know that either)
Thargoids use a different form of witch space than humans (I guess we can assume that, but we don't even know anything about the witch space we use)
Portals are useful if they take you somewhere you can't normally go (Uhh, yeah, sure, I mean I guess?)
Barnacles emblem looks like Magellanic cloud (Well it looks also like fried egg, dirt on a camera lens or literally any nebula I can think of)

I would take the Thargoids out of the equation. I'd concentrate on identifying what Raxxla could possible be and then brute force the s*** out of the bubble.
