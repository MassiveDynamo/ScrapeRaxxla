The way he moves his head is a hint. His beard is actually a map and it is somewhere within that mans facial hair!! 8d Where in the elite map do the points of stars match his beard hair ends?! Is he trying to out the dark wheel and reveal their secret?!

This, perhaps, is the best theory I've seen postulated in a long, long time. Alas it means that the long Michael grows his beard the farther we are from finding Raxxla. Randomius forbid he ever shaves!
