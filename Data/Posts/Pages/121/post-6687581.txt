NICE! I'd love that, but i highly doubt that you will ever find a planet with the name "Raxxla". According to the books, it is heavily guarded and kept as a secret. If my ship computer all of the sudden recognizes a planet as Raxxla I would shout at it in fury, because it didn't tell me earlier, if it knew all along.

It's most likely a random planet name and the construction orbiting it, is called Raxxla. Maybe after its discovery, Forntier will rename the planet.

I doubt the construction will have a "Raxxla" label either. Remember when Jaques went missing? They obfuscated it by naming the station "80 DD-D 774-CE-2" is it wouldn't be findable by doing a search in the Galaxy map. I'm sure Raxxla will have some similarly randomesque name and will only be identifiable by actually interacting with whatever content happens to be there.
