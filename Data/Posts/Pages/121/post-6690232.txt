One brown dwarf and seven un-landable bodies.

This may be an old post. I was reading from the page I qouted...

Is that a real pic? If you look at the name it is: DRYU BRA XX-L A7-O/0? - DYRU B -Raxxla- 7-0

That could be raxxla. 7-0 could indicate 7 planets and 0 the start. The system could be the Raxxla system. And one of those planets the Raxxla Planet. It is right in the name.

If not and there is a cluster of things name BRA - XXL A7-0 or similar. That area could be the thing people are looking for.

Or is that pic a joke pic?(NVM, I missed the obvious.)

Has anyone tried going down to the surface to explore? This and the other Raxxla systems?

I would think that is a good candidate. It has 7 planets and one 0 AKA star. Maybe you have to explore the surface carefully.

Any possibilities the other letters are an anagram?!

Maybe if you find all of the letters of all the raxxla planets it gives you a message and a hint to something?!

Notice that BRA XX-L A7-0 is 16 characters except the name with A76-0. Maybe fill in the - with a letters from the start of the name? That is 16 combos for DRYU and more for the others. Note they are all capital letters. Could this make coordiantes?

Converter tool

DRYU BRA XX-L A7-0 (in hex: DRYU=44 52 59 55)(DRYU BRA XX-L A7-0 = 44 52 59 55 20 42 52 41 20 58 58 2d 4c 20 41 37 2d 30 or 4f)
PHOOE BRA XX-L A76-0 (in hex: PHOOE=50 48 4f 4f 45)(PHOOE BBRA XX-L A76-0 = 50 48 4f 4f 45 20 42 42 52 41 20 58 58 2d 4c 20 41 37 36 2d 30 or 4f)
HYPAE BRA XX-L A7-0 (in hex: HYPAE=48 59 50 41 45)(HYPAE BRA XX-L A7-0 = 48 59 50 41 45 20 42 52 41 20 58 58 2d 4c 20 41 37 2d 30 or 4f)
OOSCS BRA XX-L A7-0 (in hex: OOSCS=4f 4f 53 43 53)(OOSCS BRA XX-L A7-0 = 4f 4f 53 43 53 20 42 52 41 20 58 58 2d 4c 20 41 37 2d 30 or 4f)

If you look at it this way you have DRYU(coordinate) B(be) Raxxla -7-0? Is that an o or a zero at the end of that?

Possibley look on the surface of planet 6 in the one with 7 planets(DRYU BRA xxl a7-0 ) and a sun or possible look if they are circling another sector. Maybe they are pointing to something.

That or maybe a hidden message in the letters. Anagram or possibly refernce to something like in another language or binary or hexadecimal. Something that can be translated. Maybe into coordinates? If you take those as letters in hex or similar what could it turn into. Or what one would it have to be? Which character limit? Anything referencing raxxla that would give a way to look at that?

Han_zen mentioned they are all in one area. are they in a circle. Or is one of them in the middle of the other three. Three is the minimum to triangulate something. 4 is the destination. Like the movie stargate.

Here is something simpler: (A-Z = 1-26)

DRYU BRA XX-L A7-0 (DRYU = 4 18 25 21)
PHOOE BRA XX-L A76-0 (PHOOE = 16 8 15 15 5)
HYPAE BRA XX-L A7-0 (8 25 16 1 5)
OOSCS BRA XX-L A7-0 (15 15 19 3 19)

If you add the numbers you also get: (68 59 64 71) in no particular order! This is assuming you don't add the B in as a number. At which point you add 2 in either setup. (70 61 66 73)

Not sure how the coordinates work in elite(or in general) but: https://edbearingcalc.neocities.org/
https://cim.sotl.org.uk/elite-dangerous/

Could these be combination or planet and or space coordinates?

The way he moves his head is a hint. His beard is actually a map and it is somewhere within that mans facial hair!! 8d Where in the elite map do the points of stars match his beard hair ends?! Is he trying to out the dark wheel and reveal their secret?!
