Raxxla is most likely an Easter Egg, and nothing more; still interesting to find but no gain outside of the novelty of having found it.

Therefore, find a system object resembling an Easter Egg (ovoid, pastel swaths), and you will probably have found Raxxla.

It should be orbiting a giant space rabbit, some sort of Warpal Bunny.
