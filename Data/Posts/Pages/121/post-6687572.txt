My bet is on an artificial construction in orbit around a planet. The Planet would be "Raxxla" and the construct would be how we players would interact with it. If it truly was in-game and findable since Gamma then planetary landing probably weren't a consideration. I'd really love it to be an old dodecahedron station existing out beyond the boundaries of the frontier.

NICE! I'd love that, but i highly doubt that you will ever find a planet with the name "Raxxla". According to the books, it is heavily guarded and kept as a secret. If my ship computer all of the sudden recognizes a planet as Raxxla I would shout at it in fury, because it didn't tell me earlier, if it knew all along.

It's most likely a random planet name and the construction orbiting it, is called Raxxla. Maybe after its discovery, Forntier will rename the planet.
