Founders Worlds is not connected to Raxxla hunt. I tried anything i could think of for a week there with no result.

My Theory: The Dark Wheel faction in founders world is just a front...Simply The dark Wheel started to gather unwanted attention and wanted to make a new start. The Core members of the group left the faction and recruit some noobs in their place just to run The Dark Wheel and then they start building the new faction (The Children Of Raxxla) with new elite members while they stay in the dark. The Salome storyline fits perfectly into that and its even mentioned on their website. Maybe in HR 6421 there might be some clues.
