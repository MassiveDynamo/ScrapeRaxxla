Okay, lets assume that Raxxla exists. Since we don't know what it is, it doesn't make any sense searching for it. We need at least to think about the possibilities, to get an idea of what we are looking for.

So what could it possibly be?

"It's a planet!"

"It's a celestial body!"

"It's a human!"

"It's an artificial construction!"

My bet is on an artificial construction in orbit around a planet. The Planet would be "Raxxla" and the construct would be how we players would interact with it. If it truly was in-game and findable since Gamma then planetary landing probably weren't a consideration. I'd really love it to be an old dodecahedron station existing out beyond the boundaries of the frontier.

I doubt its a human. Its hard to imagine how a myth that began around a person would expand to where common belief is that this person is a planet. I suppose it could be both ... a person named "Raxxla" who lived on a planet that gradually came to be associated with that name but if Raxxla is a person then my bet would be on the person being non-human. There'd have to be something more to this person that would account for a myth to grow up ground them.

Of course it would be nice if the game included some kind of Encyclopedia Galactica so we could actually read what the actual myths about Raxxla are. Even in we never get to become acquainted with the actual myth of Raxxla ... just the fact that those myths exist. This leaves those of us playing the game as outsiders. Frontier back-filled the lore in some of the early Galnet articles but they've never given us any hint of what actual people in 3304 know or think they know about Raxxla. That leaves all of us knights of Camelot out here poking and prodding into crazy theories because all we really have that is concrete is a name. Raxxla.
