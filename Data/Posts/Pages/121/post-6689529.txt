If we assume that Raxxla is in the bubble, we would need to organize a stuctured search, assigning sectors to commanders. Every commander needs to check let's say 10 systems. At first they need to scan everything, and lets say, let 3 USSs pop up and investigate what they are per body and let's say 5 in deepspace. We collect the Data in a spreadsheet and exclude every possibility.


Imho, totally inconsistent with the personal journey-clue-thing. No brute force nor skybox triangulations nor community goal will do it this time.
Only passing seven portals, crossing the Underworld, making friends with Cthulhu... and so on... (joking [haha])

The celestial bodies thang, well, the following things are considered as celestial bodies:
- gas: stars, star hulls, gas giants, gas nebulae, interstellar matter, molecule clouds, halos
- solid: planets, moons, asteroids, comets, meteorites
- dust: dark clouds, planetary rings, interplanetary dust
- compound systems: star clusters, galaxies, galaxy clusters
- voids: star voids, galactic voids
- unknown: black holes, dark matter

Pick your favourite. Of course we can eliminate some of those options but there are still too many possibilities.

Whatever of these it is, IF the Devs want us to find it, we will recognize it when we see it and if it's a quest-like thing, we will reach a point in which we know where to travel. The last jump to R will only be a formality.
Imho, there is no point in asking ourselves so much.
The game, Elite: Dangerous, says it is a celestial body obfuscated in the outer rim and the quest has to do with TDW faction. And following this, believe me, you'll make a quarter of a half of a tenth of a step in a direction I hope is the right one...The problem is, at some point there is a sign which says "road closed." For now I hope.. :x
