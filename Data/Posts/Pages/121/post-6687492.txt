Okay, lets assume that Raxxla exists. Since we don't know what it is, it doesn't make any sense searching for it. We need at least to think about the possibilities, to get an idea of what we are looking for.

So what could it possibly be?

"It's a planet!"

"It's a celestial body!"

"It's a human!"

"It's an artificial construction!"
