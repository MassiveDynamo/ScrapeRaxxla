Maybe its just FD that wants to keep this a secret just for plot reasons......After the whole Thargoid thing blows up they probably want to use Raxxla to introduce another major villain in the universe....right now who knows?

Your probably right. Im not expecting to find Raxxla and then have a message that says I beat Elite Dangerous.
Though, in my head I would feel like I had beat Elite Dangerous.
