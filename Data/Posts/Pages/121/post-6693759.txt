If founders world can only be accessed by founders it might not be eligale since/if something said you can be either founder or elite. Or was that just speculation on peoples part? Or can you access founders at tripple elite? That would be nice. I hate permanently cut off content.

You can access the Founders World by reaching Elite in any of the four disciplines (Combat, Trade, Exploration, CQC).
