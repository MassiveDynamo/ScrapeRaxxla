Is this to do with the known bug due to duplication of stars?

Where a name from a star catalog can be entered and it takes you to a non existent star? But really the ‘real star’ is just next door and uses an alternative name?

I presume that’s due to use of duplicative star catalogs. That’s a known bug. We presume too there are ‘Dev’ systems / sectors only they can access for testing.

From what you’ve highlighted identifies a specific set of intentional flags which enforce limits on certain ‘hidden’ stars, insinuating that they can be visited if you hit a certain gate?

Not I presume gated because they are inserted by error, bugged or locked for devs?

Not being a coder I wouldn’t want to presume the meaning, or source, please elaborate, is this in game code, are these ‘description’ in game and how were they found?

Pics please?

As if there is a gating method that really does throw the cat out of the box.

This I find interesting because I was just discussing this theory. Originally certain missions were gated, you had to be Elite to see them; FD nerfed that cool idea, so that everyone could see and engage with them.

It made me wonder if certain system missions were still intentionally gated, eg some are not Elite so many theories are based on research, if there is a path and if it’s gated one would not be able to identify anything unless you hit certain requirements.

But certain activity is only logical if it’s intentional game mechanisms, if so why is FD not communicating that certain stars are hidden, then certain paths are intentionally hidden, it would encourage players to play the game, unless it’s intention is just to restrict access to Dev level areas, bugged data or archived content no longer intended for play?

Which is why we share data.
