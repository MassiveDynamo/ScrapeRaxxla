@Suhurrat above mentioned The Alien World and Egypt.
IIRC Holdstock in that book (very long time since I read it) had Raxxla related to a number of “Talmor Lenses” & one of those was a pyramid on Earth. Also IIRC the Egyptian pyramids were built so they pointed at a specific star, though that alignment has changed due to Earth’s precession over the millenia. It may be a silly question, but has anyone checked what the original star alignment was and checked that system in-game for anything unusual?
