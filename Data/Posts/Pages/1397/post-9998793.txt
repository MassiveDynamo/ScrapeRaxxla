John Harper, author of Elite: Here Comes the Wheel, wrote in a comment on Kickstarter:
"You don't know what I saw. I sailed beyond the Formidine rift, saw a fleet of octagonal ships blocking the stars. I was standing on lost worlds, sterilized by the targoids and erased from the maps of humanity. I saw graves from the time of the Targoid wars, countless tombstones extending beyond the curvature of the horizon, small spots of reflected light dotting the abandoned continent.
Just wrt to this quote - it was written, afaik, at a time when the Thargoid story was mean to evolve in the Bovomit sector, which is out beyond the Formidine Rift. At some point the story got changed to the Plaeiades nebula instead, so the quote is a little out of date.

The rift is part of the story of Salome from Premonition, by Drew Wagar. The Exodus project had three destinations, basically as an escape route for the Club in the event of a thargoid invasion, so having one in the FR area woud obviously be counter-productive if the original quote were true.

Unfortunately plans change, and we have no idea what is relevant and what has been superseded, and its not in FD's best interests to let us know.
