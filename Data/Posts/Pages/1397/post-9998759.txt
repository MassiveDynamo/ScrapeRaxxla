Nice work @Suhurrat this might help:

Codex: Raxxla (published late 3304)
"... To the whisperer in witch-space, the siren of the deepest void! ..."

FORMIDINE RIFT ALPHA MISSION (Discovered early 3303)
Expedition Log: 28/08/3270
"Jump drive malfunctioned today ... Could have sworn I heard some weird voices in the last jump. ..."
Expedition Log: 07/10/3270
“I can’t bear another jump. The lights in witch-space are coming for me, the lights… always the lights… they’re calling to me… a siren song… I must join them…”

Galnet 3303 Hyperspace (Published early 3303)
"... Many pilots have reported glimpsing inexplicable lights, and even structures, within the witch-space tunnels. ..."

There's more references than this - but it's very clear there are huge signposts to Witch Space and they match pretty well parts of the Dark Wheel Toast. That's not a coincidence.

I think you're on the right path with that connection
