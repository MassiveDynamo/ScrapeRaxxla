You also have the oldest myth, of Apollo and the serpent Drakaina (also known as Drakon and Python) at Delhi (origin name Delphine); the ‘rift’ is mentioned in that story as the location where the beast was slain and then the temple was built on top of the rotting corpse.

Rotting Thargoid base on the planet that’s directly under the ‘Oracle’ in the Delphi system! First logical assumption on day 1… but nothing to back it up further as it’s the same as all the other dead hulks(?).

Delphi in reality is also based upon a very real geological fissure. So in the context of Delphi a ‘rift’ equates to crack in the ground.

In certain historical contexts it’s thought omphalos were meteorites, carved and venerated in the early cults…literally gifts from the gods.
