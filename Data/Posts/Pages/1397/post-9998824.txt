Maybe! I think it's incredibly vague and disappointing tbh. Notice they wouldn't actually say "it's not significant", they dodged that question with a blanket "no comment".

Edit:

They can't confirm it's significant, understandably, that would be cheating.
However, imo they can confirm whether it's not significant because there's 400bn stars in the galaxy and limitless other options.
The fact they wouldn't confirm it's not signficant is susy imo.
But then, if they could confirm insignificance to the quest then we would eventually whittle down the options
So... maybe they never reply straight to any question.
= incredibly frustrating.

I would pay a billion credits to just ask an Earth historian about the Sol system over the last 1000 years. The fact we can't do that is irritating.

They did confirm it’s not significant. Their initial reply on it was that it simply didn’t make the cut, as they can’t add all 80+ moons and most have to be left out. They only started getting ambiguous with “no comment” after the issue was pressed….

As in… “Hey they seem really interested in it even after we said it was cut for practicality reasons, let’s just say no comment, it’ll keep them interested and guessing for a while longer.”
