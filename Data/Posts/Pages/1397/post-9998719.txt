They did. But I think ‘it didn’t make the cut’ is an answer.

I do find it odd, due to the naming evidence in game, the cultural significance both in history, science and popular culture. Very, very odd.

But maybe on day 1 they couldn’t put it in due to resources, and it was too small because potatoes weren’t put in game until much later.

Then after as stuff was added it was left off simply because of complacency / ignorance. But I suspect it’s just not worth their time?

Agreed it needs rest, look for other things in game which relate to it, then approach from another angle, look for a contradiction - then throw it back at them.

Remember, when I began asking about the DW missions and permits I was actually told several times, working as intended… I then approached it from another perspective and boom they contradicted themselves, I gave them their own statements and they had to give a logical answer.

It’s worth putting a pin in this and looking at it later
