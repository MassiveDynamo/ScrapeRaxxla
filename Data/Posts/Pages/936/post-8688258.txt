Another layman here. I just wanted to add that the word brow seems either equally or more important. Is this telling us that the jewel is high up in the galactic plane or situated in a connecting 'arm spiral'. I know this is basic and I applaud the deep research above. I know this isn't contributing much. I'll go back to sweeping in the corner lol.
Edit - I've just realised I was replying to a much earlier discussion. Apologies. It was the jewel on the brow clue.
No worries, all levels of experience are welcome. There's always the chance we are over thinking some things so the outside pov might be more helpful than we might initially assume. Incidentally I've learned a great deal from this thread about many things I would otherwise not have learned
