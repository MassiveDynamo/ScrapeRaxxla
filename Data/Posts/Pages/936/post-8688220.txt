The Ysidril Tree, right? Seems clue like to me, and to many others.

I like all clues/theories/suppositions/assumptions/hypothesise - especially with Pink Floyd in the background ;-)

Keep going!
Two of the more notable albums. These are actually basically the same album, one is a set of live tours, the other studio recorded. Note the amount of digits on the mans hands.
Also note the album track layout (slightly modified due to no copy paste). The parenthesis show alternative songs, or song names, during the live performances.
The Man:
1.Introduction (Granchester Meadows)
2.Daybreak (Also Granchester Meadows)
3.Work
4.Teatime (Alan's psychedelic breakfast)
5.Afternoon (Biding my time) from the Relics album.
6.Doing It (The Grand Vizier's Party)
7.Sleep (Quicksilver)
8.Nightmare (Cymblaine)
9.Daybreak, Pt. II (Cymbaline as well)
10. Labyrinth (The Grans Vizier's Garden Party)

The Journey:
11.The Beginning (Green is the colour)
12.Beset By Creatures of the Deep (Careful with that axe Eugene)
13.The Narrow Way
14.The Pink Jungle (Piper at the gates of dawn)
15.The Labyrinths of Auximenes (Let there be more light)
16. Footsteps/Doors
17.Behold the Temple of Light (The narrow way Part 3)
18.The End of the Beginning (Celestial voices)

Obfuscation, implying maybe "Obfuscated on the outer rim" is the connection. Both albums are about the Hero's Journey, in Pink Floyd's classic method, trippy af.
This write up is so small and empty, I almost feel bad for doing it. I have future plans to display these possible connections in great depth, and really, my video series is a large part of that.
