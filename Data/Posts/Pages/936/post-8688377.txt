I agree with the overthinking. I've been playing some point and click adventure games. Kathy rain and tumbleweed Park. There's so many puzzles where I missed the obvious part of the clues. After each puzzle I was annoyed at myself for not seeing the obvious. I suppose that's the beauty of those games. A small nod to our short comings.

You should see the 'Remember Salome' thread. 2 flipping years it took to solve and 99.9% of it was overthinking, asking the ancient Greeks, looking at the stars, just about everything but the thing we were supposed to do.
