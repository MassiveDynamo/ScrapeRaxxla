Exploring what it’s telling us, or meant to tell us, is what this thread is all about.
“Brow” in UK English has a couple of meanings, & I often have to check the Oxford English Dictionary in looking at FD’s “clues”
1) the part of the face above the eyes and below the hair, the forehead
2) the eybrow
3) the top part of a hill
Correct the word seems key to me. Isn't brow also the thing used to connect a ship to its port?
