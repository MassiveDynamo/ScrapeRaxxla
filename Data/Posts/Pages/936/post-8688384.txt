I wouldn't stress it too much. I doubt fdev would use ideas from The Expanse to hide clues for their game. Although I do recommend watching the show and reading the books it was inspired by.

I suspect FD wouldn’t use something like that, they might be laying themselves open to copyright infringement etc.
I couldn’t understand the belter patois in the show & gave up on it. Did read the books, but didn’t enjoy the last one.
