If I cannot engage you enough to look beyond the first line, than I have failed, and my discussion and presentation of what I perceive to be possible clues, cannot be heard, or understood.

Ah don’t worry about it. I decided a long time ago that life is too short, especially at my age, so I tend to glance through things and only read bits that specifically interest me. I’m afraid mythology is not one of them, though sometimes I struggle with wikipedia entries to help with bits of Quest clues. Spent this morning googling bits of TDW toast against greek mythology & I think I mythed the point.
