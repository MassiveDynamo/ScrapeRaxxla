Exploring what it’s telling us, or meant to tell us, is what this thread is all about.
“Brow” in UK English has a couple of meanings, & I often have to check the Oxford English Dictionary in looking at FD’s “clues”
1) the part of the face above the eyes and below the hair, the forehead
2) the eybrow
3) the top part of a hill
should you use the Cambridge dictionary? I imagine the Oxford dictionary is spat on, in FDevs part of the world
