Anyone think this is a clue? A tiny bit obvious so you know what you are doing?

Other than Gimili is in Raxxla? ;-)

well the dark wheel did expand from shinrata to LFT 926. back in the days, it was exclusively present in shinrata alone if im not mistaken. was the expansion influenced by players or not? i dont know. but if it was, then it should be able to be expanded again.
