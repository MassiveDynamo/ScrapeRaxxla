The closest I have found matching direct coordinates, are Greek numbers.

RA, X, XLA = Rho Alpha, Chi, Chi Lambda Alpha = 101, 600, 631

Never found anything at any of the +- options that gives.

I have a more positive vibe for the Right ascension = 20(Roman XX). Not sure how the LA fits, though.
I lean towards LAtitude. Sometimes, astronomers still refer to declination as latitude. And I thought the numerals would be valid for both RA and LA (latitude/declination).

Would you please tell or show me who and where?

Sorry, I meant who has discussed this topic already and where ? OP is suggesting this in his post.

I'm sure there are other mentions in other threads, but my search gave me an older post from Cmdr Noobilite in this very thread.
