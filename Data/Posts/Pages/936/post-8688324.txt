No worries, all levels of experience are welcome. There's always the chance we are over thinking some things so the outside pov might be more helpful than we might initially assume. Incidentally I've learned a great deal from this thread about many things I would otherwise not have learned

I agree with the overthinking. I've been playing some point and click adventure games. Kathy rain and tumbleweed Park. There's so many puzzles where I missed the obvious part of the clues. After each puzzle I was annoyed at myself for not seeing the obvious. I suppose that's the beauty of those games. A small nod to our short comings.
