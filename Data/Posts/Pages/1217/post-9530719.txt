Oh, I dont think SD is the location of Raxxla, but is likely the start of the storyline to reach it (i.e. via TDW). Iâ€™m just hoping DB has tested that storyline for every game release & especially after those elite missions disappeared!
SD could well be the only logical location for Raxxla. It is the only place that fit the 'personal journey' and the 'unless you become Elite, you'll never get to Raxxla' hints.

If it's there, unscannable, on some weird orbit, there isn't much testing that has to be done for each release. The rest of 'the story line' are probably just fragmented hints, with no connected gameplay.
