Hi Jorki ... Out of curiousity where did Ed Lewis say the permits have a purpose?
Mmm, dont recall, lost in the mists of time. But I remember putting it in so he must have said it. Have you tried googling?

It sounds like it might have been said in a livestream though...

Edit: yep, just tried a forum search (member “Edward Lewis”) and also a Google & neither are coming up with the source so I think it must have been a livestream, from back in the days when I found them entertaining and informative (i.e. when I still watched them!).

Edit2: but just cos he said it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s true! Or serve a useful gameplay purpose, could be just for dev testing things within a livegame (I think they also have their own off-line test environment) without anyone else being able to get in & see/interfere...
