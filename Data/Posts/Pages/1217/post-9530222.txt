Yes, but there was apparently some initial secrecy about the meaning of the name. Why any secrecy? That’s what I find strange.

To me it suggests the name itself may be a clue...
Though I’m still in the dark!

Edit: yes, I thought we had discussed this many moons ago https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-7740549, which was my post on it.

I refer there to a previous post of mine where I had found Liqua’s original statement about the meaning and DB/MB then treating that meaning with some secrecy. My earlier post disappeared!
“Obfuscation on the older forum” perhaps??
