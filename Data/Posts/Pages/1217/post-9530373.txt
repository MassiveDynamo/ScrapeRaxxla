I suspect the tiny bit obvious has nothing to do with the location of Raxxla. Just the existence.
Oh, I dont think SD is the location of Raxxla, but is likely the start of the storyline to reach it (i.e. via TDW). Iâ€™m just hoping DB has tested that storyline for every game release & especially after those elite missions disappeared!
