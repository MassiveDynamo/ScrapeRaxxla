And just because nobody has seen those missions doesnt mean they arent still available!

See my FDev quotes thread (in signature) for “Missing Elite/Founder missions (Raxxla/TDW-related)”:
Adam Bourke-Waite said in Dec 2016 “I will try to look into this, they should still be available.”
And Will, or Ed, said to the question “Will the “Founder or Elite” missions ever get added back into the game?”
“Nothing to talk about on this right now” which is suggestive.

Either those E/F missions were too obvious and have been replacd by something else, or they were total misdirection and were deemed to be unsuitable, or they are still there but not triggering-either through another bug or because the trigger has been changed. We know Raxxla is part of an in-game storyline (see my thread ref), so I’m not overly fussed about these E/F missions per se- What is material is how to get back into the storyline.
