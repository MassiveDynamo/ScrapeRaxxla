SD could well be the only logical location for Raxxla. It is the only place that fit the 'personal journey' and the 'unless you become Elite, you'll never get to Raxxla' hints.

If it's there, unscannable, on some weird orbit, there isn't much testing that has to be done for each release. The rest of 'the story line' are probably just fragmented hints, with no connected gameplay.
It would certainly answer the “personal journey” clue, but I still suspect Raxxla is (perhaps associated with) an asteroid in Sol, hence the Martian Artefact. But the in-game story to access it may well be via SD.
