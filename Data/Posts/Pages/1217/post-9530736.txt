@Comandante : Hi Commander. I said I'd look up the system descriptions of the permit locked systems for you to check. I've added them into my own permits list sheet here
ED Personal Journey Permits.ods

happy theorising!

Personally- I'm wondering if it's possible to download a copy of the Codex text so I can theorise in comfort on my iPad rather than sat at my gaming PC, with my RSI playing up. Anybody any ideas???
