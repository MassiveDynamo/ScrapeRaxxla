Yeah but the missions does not exist anymore so is it valid?
The big issue with much of the “lore” is we never know if things are truely in or out. There is no Official lore book that we have access to… beyond the Codex and Galnet.
Just because the mission isnt offered anymore could mean anything. I think we either assume it is or isnt based on whatever pet theory we are working with at the time
