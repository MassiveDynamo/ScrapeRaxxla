Thank you.

Midday? Most of us in the UK will be at work, and our US and Canadian cousins will still be asleep. What devilry is this!? Unfair!

There's NO WAY I could get away with watching this at work.

Your one of the lucky ones! The livestream is mostly broadcast to give those of us who are off work and can't play due to the servers being down something to do while we wait.
