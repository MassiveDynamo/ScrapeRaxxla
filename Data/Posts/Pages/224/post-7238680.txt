Interesting hypothesis. I’ll check it out when I can next get into game, probably late tomorrow as I suspect the servers will be down until late afternoon at the earliest.

edit: just googled orion, see https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(constellation) & unless I’ve misunderstood it I’m not convinced by your hypothesis. Things that count against it are: in the image from the star video what you describe as the belt stars are horizontal, but from the wiki article it is clear that the belt stars are angled upwards; but the decisive point is the right foot star (to right between symbol head & wing) would be Rigel, but SpocksOddOcks has already pointed out that is one of the stars by the Witchhead nebula in the start video image. In the image the star between the “horns” appears to be a yellow (G type) , but running the main Orion star names against EDSM none of them are G (the middle belt star is in-game as Epsilon Orionis).

I also thought the same thing with the alignment but all the other stars are there ! I was thinking maybe it is viewed from a slightly different perspective (close to sol) to make it les obvious .... as i said above this was the line i was going down when i was following the white rabbit lol.
Stil it strikes me as suspicious that all three have black holes in game and definitely not in reality!
