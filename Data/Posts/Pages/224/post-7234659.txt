Not sure how long ago it was being discussed but the screen shot that was posted of the titlescreen is definitely Orion (the star in the middle of the logo is the last of the 3 in its "belt") ive been looking for years and inmho its there somewhere! I spent alot of time investigating Orion especially the belt regions the large part if that being spent at the middle star but as stated if this is a clue (and my original research /theory is correct ) then it would have been better spent at the third (cant remember the names atm but one reason i thought it was the center star of the 3 was becouse in game its the only one of the 3 named as its moden scientific allocation and not as its ancient astrological name! Also not sure if it relates but all 3 have black holes in their systems (unlike in reality)

Hope this helps as ive moved on now anyway

Interesting hypothesis. I’ll check it out when I can next get into game, probably late tomorrow as I suspect the servers will be down until late afternoon at the earliest.

edit: just googled orion, see https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(constellation) & unless I’ve misunderstood it I’m not convinced by your hypothesis. Things that count against it are: in the image from the star video what you describe as the belt stars are horizontal, but from the wiki article it is clear that the belt stars are angled upwards; but the decisive point is the right foot star (to right between symbol head & wing) would be Rigel, but SpocksOddOcks has already pointed out that is one of the stars by the Witchhead nebula in the start video image. In the image the star between the “horns” appears to be a yellow (G type) , but running the main Orion star names against EDSM none of them are G (the middle belt star is in-game as Epsilon Orionis).
