I also thought the same thing with the alignment but all the other stars are there ! I was thinking maybe it is viewed from a slightly different perspective (close to sol) to make it les obvious .... as i said above this was the line i was going down when i was following the white rabbit lol.
Stil it strikes me as suspicious that all three have black holes in game and definitely not in reality!

Well, I'm very aware that Mintaka has a black hole in game, can't speak for Epsilon Orionis as I haven't visited. However, I have been to Alnitak, and unless my discovery scanner missed it 3 years ago, it doesn't have a black hole (checked the system map in game last night).
