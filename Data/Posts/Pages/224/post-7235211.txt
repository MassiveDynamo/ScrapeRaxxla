Interesting hypothesis. I’ll check it out when I can next get into game, probably late tomorrow as I suspect the servers will be down until late afternoon at the earliest.

edit: just googled orion, see https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(constellation) & unless I’ve misunderstood it I’m not convinced by your hypothesis. Things that count against it are: in the image from the star video what you describe as the belt stars are horizontal, but from the wiki article it is clear that the belt stars are angled upwards; but the decisive point is the right foot star (to right between symbol head & wing) would be Rigel, but SpocksOddOcks has already pointed out that is one of the stars by the Witchhead nebula in the start video image. In the image the star between the “horns” appears to be a yellow (G type) , but running the main Orion star names against EDSM none of them are G (the middle belt star is in-game as Epsilon Orionis).
So does this mean that this Far God stuff may be related? I checked out Etain 4a and 4c yesterday and listened to all 9 recorded logs on both outposts. Interesting stuff, it is.
