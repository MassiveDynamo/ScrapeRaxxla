The whole 'tiny bit obvious' possibly related to the older DW missions which were binned.

They were bit obvious because they discussed Raxxla ergo 'tiny bit obvious'.

Think we ought not to rely too much on old clues nor lore as its likely FD has scrapped that narrative in favour of what we have now.

I'm going off the assumption all current lore is in the codex and anything prior to that may no longer be relevant.

If ever there is another Q & A we ought to get this clarified.

There is a strong hint in the Dark Wheel codex entry that the old missions have been scrapped, in that Felicity farseer more or less states that TDW in Shindez is a fake. Thats a whole paragraph to say just that..
