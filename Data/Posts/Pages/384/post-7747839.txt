OK, sure, I get the post, but if you search google for 'amateur image andromeda galaxy' - none are pink and all look a lot more convincing than from the game, so I'm not sure I buy the explanation..

Could be an amateur astrophoto in Hydrogen Alpha.

Though I do agree that it seems out of place compared to all the rest of the graphics
