But whats left in Shin Dez is just a shell... people been hauling for them for 6 months and nothing happens..all the old 'shhhh - you know' missions suddenly vanished and no menation of R ever again.
I've kept an eye on passenger missions and some of them demand transportation of famous explorers to very distant places in the galaxy, and since TDW is "...a legendary group of adventurers, explorers, investigators and treasure hunters...", it seems logical to me to give those explorers a ride, most probably among other things to do for TDW in order to pass "a suitable test of courage and skill".

I don't think that those that did missions for 6 months made multiple 20 kLy trips, but I'm still waiting for the confirmation.

IMHO those missions in the bubble are there only to get allied with TDW.
