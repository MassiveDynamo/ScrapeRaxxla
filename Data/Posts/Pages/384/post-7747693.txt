Been out for a week, and there are a few new contributors who have gone over some old ground - welcome to the chase!

To help provide a way marker, I reference The Siant's potted summary of this now very huge thread which details much of the tinfoil that's already been explored.

in addition some useful resources:
Ian Bells page of the dark whell novella by Robert Holdstock
Alternatively, reading the whole thread is not too time consuming if you scan quickly through..

Over on discord, Scolio's channel also has some nice resources - I'll leave it to him to invite. There is also some info on the Canonn discord thread, though this is quieter now.

With regards to Lave - the FSS can find a tin-can in space (eg voyager probes) at great distances - we have no reason to doubt it can find a planetary body at any distance.
In lore, Raxxla is always described as a planet - or planet sized object or place. Also there is no reason to assume its close to the bubble - its quite possibly up to 10 kLy from sol, which would explain why no-one has 'bumped into' it. The Dark Wheel station is a different matter and more likely closer.

I had the same thing - a mission to lave2 that was undeliverable - a bug.

Re: the old worlds, here is my list of old world systems in game and the ensuing research from others - this was triggered by Drew wondering about the old worlds and why only some are in the game and some are a bit off location..
