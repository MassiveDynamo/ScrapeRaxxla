Been out for a week, and there are a few new contributors who have gone over some old ground - welcome to the chase!

To help provide a way marker, I reference The Siant's potted summary of this now very huge thread which details much of the tinfoil that's already been explored.

in addition some useful resources:

Alternatively, reading the whole thread is not too time consuming if you scan quickly through..

Over on discord, Scolio's channel also has some nice resources - I'll leave it to him to invite. There is also some info on the Canonn discord thread, though this is quieter now.

With regards to Lave - the FSS can find a tin-can in space (eg voyager probes) at great distances - we have no reason to doubt it can find a planetary body at any distance.
In lore, Raxxla is always described as a planet - or planet sized object or place. Also there is no reason to assume its close to the bubble - its quite possibly up to 10 kLy from sol, which would explain why no-one has 'bumped into' it. The Dark Wheel station is a different matter and more likely closer.

xzanfr: I had the same thing - a mission to lave2 that was undeliverable - a bug.

Re: the old worlds, here is my list of old world systems in game and the ensuing research from others - this was triggered by Drew wondering about the old worlds and why only some are in the game and some are a bit off location..
