Mmm, I’m not sure tharg-bashing would appeal to “adventurers, explorers, investigators and treasure-hunters”.
Long-distance trips perhaps? Anyone done a couple of long-distance passenger missions for NTDW (especially if they were successor missions)?
Still feel I was on the right track with my interpretation of TDW toast....

Raising this again. TRDW are reported to be explorers and adventurers, so it makes sense for their test to involve exploration/long distance trips. Anybody studied:
1) their long distance passenger missions?
2) only handing in exploration data to them (e.g. Neuman Camp in SD)? -perhaps there’s a threshold that has to be reached?
@Macros? Scytale?
