Is there some kind of confirmation saying that Drew Wagar has anymore real information about the dark wheel than he has about raxxla. This is just my own thoughts on it though I don't really know what's going on.

Not sure. He has said categorically he knows nothing about Raxxla, that The Club was DB’s idea. I assume Club & TDW lore was written into the FD lore manual which I think all the writers had access to (which strengthens my belief that the storyline of Oresrians vs Klaxians & a human shield is valid) since it appears in a couple of books plus in-game logs by Salomé). He started a lore thread (https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/lore-questions.459433/post-7182920), I’ll have a look...
Edit: nothing in there, but he has brought his lore guides back online https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/lore-guides.280826/post-4369535 edit2: nope, checked that url & it’s not there!
He started a lore primer thread for PS4: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/lore-primer-for-ps4-players.355915/post-5579041
I guess from his phrasing in this post https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-5313370 that he doesn’t know much more than us about TDW
And there is Elite : Legacy by (the) Michael Brookes, now I vaguely have a thought of a suggestion, or perhaps a less solid inference, that Michael Brookes’ story was supposed to be a spiritual successor to The Dark Wheel original by Robert Holdstock (available free online). However for the life of me I can’t remember if this was ever confirmed, or even what the story is about. I really need to reread all these books! But it might be worth a comment from anyone who does remember this story.

I have had two successive nights with less than 5 hours sleep, and painful sinus headache, so must now have a post-lunch snooze!
