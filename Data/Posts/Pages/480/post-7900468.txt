Not sure. He has said categorically he knows nothing about Raxxla, that The Club was DB’s idea. I assume Club & TDW lore was written into the FD lore manual which I think all the writers had access to (which strengthens my belief that the storyline of Oresrians vs Klaxians & a human shield is valid) since it appears in a couple of books plus in-game logs by Salomé). He started a lore thread (https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/lore-questions.459433/post-7182920), I’ll have a look...
Edit: nothing in there, but he has brought his lore guides back online https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/lore-guides.280826/post-4369535 edit2: nope, checked that url & it’s not there!
He started a lore primer thread for PS4: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/lore-primer-for-ps4-players.355915/post-5579041
I guess from his phrasing in this post https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-5313370 that he doesn’t know much more than us about TDW
And there is Elite : Legacy by (the) Michael Brookes, now I vaguely have a thought of a suggestion, or perhaps a less solid inference, that Michael Brookes’ story was supposed to be a spiritual successor to The Dark Wheel original by Robert Holdstock (available free online). However for the life of me I can’t remember if this was ever confirmed, or even what the story is about. I really need to reread all these books! But it might be worth a comment from anyone who does remember this story.

I have had two successive nights with less than 5 hours sleep, and painful sinus headache, so must now have a post-lunch snooze!

Hey thank you there's a lot of exactly what I was looking for in your response

on a side note I've only been getting 4 hours of sleep for 25 years I think you should be okay
