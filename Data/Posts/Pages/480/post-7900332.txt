Take a Beluga !

Was playing around yesterday with Coriolis & checked beluga, orca & dolphin. Never flown either of them, but the stats didn’t impress me over much. The annie can get range with useful number of slots, but is just too cumbersome and slow, and useless visibility. Tyko’s already got a Python which I used as a mining ship to unlock an engineer. At present am re-engineering the python for cargo/passenger missions (yesterday did a 16 ly DW passenger mission in the hope that my recent Broken Heart trip might have unlocked a trigger for the test, after all that CTD must relate to something, but nope). I like the python, but I like the Phantom more. Got Tyko a new phantom & engineered up to 63ly with beam, MC and PA (just in case Scytale!). Think Jorki’s annie is going to go to Honest Bob’s Used Ship Emporium, unless I decide to totally strip it and go for range, but that's not the sort of exploration I do. Might look at a passenger build for it.
