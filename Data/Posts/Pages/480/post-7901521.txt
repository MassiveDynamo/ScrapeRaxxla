I, for myself, spent months flying all types of missions and explo data exclusively for them. Nothing special...

Can you remember what sort of distance their passenger missions were that you did? It would be an obvious method for a group of explorers & adventurers to filter out people who were of similar mindset.
(Although having done ~70kly+ on DW2 Jorki’s not yet been approached , though to be fair he’s still carousing in Jacques’ bar & hasn’t been back to Shinrarta). Having done the Broken Heart trip Tyko’s not been approached either
( still think something’s broken there!)
