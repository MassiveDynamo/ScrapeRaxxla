Raising this again. TRDW are reported to be explorers and adventurers, so it makes sense for their test to involve exploration/long distance trips. Anybody studied:
1) their long distance passenger missions?
2) only handing in exploration data to them (e.g. Neuman Camp in SD)? -perhaps thereâ€™s a threshold that has to be reached?
@Macros? Scytale?

I've been watching the passenger missions for a few days, and the furthest so far has been to Colonia.
