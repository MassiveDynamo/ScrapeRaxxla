That’s a bad cough you’ve got there friend
Fish bone stuck?

Yes, I saw your point on that, quite valid!
but I’m grasping at straws here!
Beginning to think there are no requirements, there is no test, and it’s just a matter of dumb luck to find TDW station
But I’m tired and too hot, need a lavian brandy!
