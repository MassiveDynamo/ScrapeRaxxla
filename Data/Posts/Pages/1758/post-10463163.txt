Is there a way to get the download benefit of my 1Gbps internet speed? The last update just trickled in at around 10 Mbps for over an hour. I gather Steam can support fast download, but my ED is from FD.
I had the same issue, the FD link through your desktop is to a specific location in the UK, in my understanding it’s is a rather old and limited link which is prone to slow connection based upon locality.

The Steam key, does not actually replace your desktop, it’s just a launch window.

FD obviously supply these 3rd party apps with updates, and in my experience are probably better supported than the official link.

When my PC worked the steam key was my preferred access point, and updates took seconds rather than minutes/hours.
