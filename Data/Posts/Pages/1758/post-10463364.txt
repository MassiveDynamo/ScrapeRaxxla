Sorry, are you saying I can download through Steam even though I havent bought it through them?
Didnt know that was possible..thought it had to be in your Steam library (after purchase) to get it that way...

A friend also has fttp internet and said Steam downloads are relatively fast (he's a COD player, not ED)

Yes.

I too bought ED through FD. Each purchase actually has a free Steam key. Look into your FD purchase library on the FD store, it will be in there.

Enable it and the game will just launch through Steam. I had found it increased update speeds by 400%.

Itâ€™s a common problem since forever.
