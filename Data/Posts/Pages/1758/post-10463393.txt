Yes.

I too bought ED through FD. Each purchase actually has a free Steam key. Look into your FD purchase library on the FD store, it will be in there.

Enable it and the game will just launch through Steam. I had found it increased update speeds by 400%.

Itâ€™s a common problem since forever.
Are you sure?
Just looking at my FD Store account at the Odyssey upgrade in 2020... No Steam Entitlements, no sign of any Steam key.

edit
ah partner keys, looks like I should be able to log in via Steam and that might generate a Steam key...

I'll try the minilauncher mechanism first, having spent all morning on it
