The last update just trickled in at around 10 Mbps for over an hour.
Some of this will be processing speed of comparing files for the update locally, rather than the download itself. Are you installed to a SSD or a traditional hard drive?

Mine normally gets 20-30Mbps from Frontier's servers if I leave it to it, but if I do other stuff requiring disk access on the computer it drops to single figures.
