I had the same issue, the FD link through your desktop is to a specific location in the UK, in my understanding it’s is a rather old and limited link which is prone to slow connection based upon locality.

The Steam key, does not actually replace your desktop, it’s just a launch window.

FD obviously supply these 3rd party apps with updates, and in my experience are probably better supported than the official link.

When my PC worked the steam key was my preferred access point, and updates took seconds rather than minutes/hours.

Sorry, are you saying I can download through Steam even though I havent bought it through them?
Didnt know that was possible..thought it had to be in your Steam library (after purchase) to get it that way...

A friend also has fttp internet and said Steam downloads are relatively fast (he's a COD player, not ED)
