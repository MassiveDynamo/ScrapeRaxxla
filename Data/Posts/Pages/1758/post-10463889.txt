So, if moving to a Steam version, do you have to delete all the existing FD installation? And if so how do you keep your character & possessions?

Negative.

Your profile on PC stays the same. I did not wipe my PC to accommodate the Steam key.

In fact when itâ€™s working it actually uses the FD launcher. The Steam key essentially is just a mechanism to import patches.
