It is a Halloween treasure hunt, the solution to ‘witch’ has already been resolved by Cmdrs via a number of locational beacons.

I had mapped the locations myself on the off chance but they all fall just outside the area of interest, I thought there might have been something, but it’s too far removed and isolated.

The closest system of interest relatively was Fintan.

If it were so simple.
