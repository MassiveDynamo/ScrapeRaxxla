I suspect Polaris is locked because it was so important to previous versions of Elite. To reinforce that ED is different and previous lore may not apply.

Im of the opinion that Polaris and all the other locked off sections of the galaxy were all part of a now retconned version of the game.

I do suspect FD made an executive decision at some point and diverted the game development. I presume these are now simply redundant.
