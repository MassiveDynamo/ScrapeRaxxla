Some of this will be processing speed of comparing files for the update locally, rather than the download itself. Are you installed to a SSD or a traditional hard drive?

Mine normally gets 20-30Mbps from Frontier's servers if I leave it to it, but if I do other stuff requiring disk access on the computer it drops to single figures.
Mmm. Good question. Ive got an ssd for C:/, but hard drives for data etc. it's probably loading to the hard drive. But I get so bored waiting for it to download I don't have anything else going. I get bored waiting up to 15 - 30 minutes for the download to actually start!!
