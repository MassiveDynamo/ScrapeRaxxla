Yes.

I too bought ED through FD. Each purchase actually has a free Steam key. Look into your FD purchase library on the FD store, it will be in there.

Enable it and the game will just launch through Steam. I had found it increased update speeds by 400%.

Itâ€™s a common problem since forever.
What sort of download speed do you see through Steam, and what's your internet speed?
