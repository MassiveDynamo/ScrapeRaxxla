Same for me... it's a couple of months since I played ED, and then the only thing that interests me is Raxxla. -- Raxxla is a good puzzle (actually a bit too good!!).
Speaking of which , i'm surprised no one has posted THIS---> https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threa...unter-herman-colt-missing-29-oct-3310.628938/ yet here into thread , because maybe just maybe 'FDev' agrees ( re: puzzle "a bit too good" ) and maybe just maybe they're trying to steer or inspire us to finally find the ultimate treasure hunt of RAXXLA before another 10 years pass?

Then again, it could also be totally unrelated.
