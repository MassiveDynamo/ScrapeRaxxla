Huge what if here. What if the fall of the guardians predates humanty? The Guardians resemble us enough to warrent Ram Tah's enthusiasm. They do in fact have the ability to develop racial varieties. The lack of bladed arms can be chalked up to evolution.

If so, It explains the Fossilised thing on Mars. Wasn't it a tablet? Either way now we have two possible directions. Sol or the Monolith Network.

Still, what is Raxxla? Either a planet (unlikely), gateway, or a mobile archive housing an AI. Or all of the above.

If it's Guardian made it uses EM propulsion. Look for large EM signatures in Shinrarta.
