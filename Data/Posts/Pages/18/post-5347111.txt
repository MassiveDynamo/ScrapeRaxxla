Is there anywhere a list with official accepted lore books and stories? Also, is there a database somewhere where we could access all galnet articles at once?

I still believe a hint has to be somewhere, and that we have to follow the old stories or galnet. The hint might be very well hidden and faint, but there has to be something where we could start...
