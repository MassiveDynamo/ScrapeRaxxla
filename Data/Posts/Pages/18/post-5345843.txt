Considering Shinrarta's distance from Lave is 57.6 (?)ly this puts us in the ballpark. Deviations may result due to Raxxla having a more efficient way of travel.

Unless Raxxla's been moving again... Oh, no. No, no NO! This is why they were trying to re-find something! It went awol. It makes sense now. They are literally trying to track down clues about it's origins to find it again. Great. Who dropped the cosmic car key?
