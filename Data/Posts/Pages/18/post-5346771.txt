Very interesting ideas... are we in agreement we have a testable theory? (-ish)

"A place that isn't a place, a door that is also the key".

Personally, I'm still firmly holding on to my belief that Raxxla is actually a virtual database of sorts, of the guardians creation. One of their virtual workstations where they could log in and work with other guardians no matter where they were in the galaxy, all thanks to the monolith network and neural implants. Humans found a way to access this virtual world and the knowledge contained, but then they lost it. I also believe there are those in positions of power that have regained access to Raxxla and are using it to make incredible leaps forward in technology. I dont know how we could find it ourselves, except for learning more about the guardians and their ruins, maybe finding their home world.

Just speculation based on what I have learned in my studies of the many mysteries in the galaxy. I could be completely wrong but it is my best guess at the moment

I do wish you all the best of luck though!
