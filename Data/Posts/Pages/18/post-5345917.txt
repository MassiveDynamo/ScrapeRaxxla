Better question. How massive is it? Something huge moving that fast has to have a noticable energy signature.
Then again, we can't detect signals with our scanners after x amount of distance. So it's a station sized gateway... Probably like the thing in Polaris. A mobile spacetime rift to somewhere else or a mobile archive of scientific data...
