All official fiction.
GalNet databases.

Elite, much like the old west; has incredible legends and ghost stories. Most good tales, no matter how unbelevable, all start with a shread of truth surrounded in fluff.
You just need to pick out what can be proven or disproven.
Raxxla is one such oddity. This means we need to sort through all the data and find the truths that yet linger. We need to prove the old novels stories are either lore or not. It will help pick out what was kept.
