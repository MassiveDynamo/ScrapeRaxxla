@EfilOne: I didn't expect to use those methods to find Raxxla in one go, I just thought it might give us some other lead to follow. But good point on the datamining, this is not the way we want to solve the puzzle.

@Storm Valkyrie: Please can you use Edit Post instead of multiposting?
Sorry. My ideas tend to elude me if not written down. Will remember though!
