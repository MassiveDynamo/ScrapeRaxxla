CIEP isnt TDW. There was a schism between the brothers and they the ones who went with Oberon became CIEP. The CIEP chose to exploit Soontill while TDW continued their search for Raxxla
It also sounds like the CIEP was more interested in thargoid techs than anything else. Probably Club collaborators.
