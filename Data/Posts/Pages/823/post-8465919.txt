We dont know and i honestly have no evidence for this. But in the same respect there isnt a lot of evidence against it either
Jea and I think that's where we all get stuck in the end. :/ I mean it's pretty understandable that the developers don't want anyone to randomly find Raxxla (whatever it is in the end) but rather placed some sort of hint we overlooked that would bring us there.

I've read a bit about rogue planets in Elite and it seems that they where indeed a concept planned pretty early and where supposed to cause problems while jumping but have been removed. In the end that still does not fully deny that it could be a rogue planet, but that would mean we could not jump there with current means. Maybe those rogue planets are actually their own system but we would need the coordinates to know where to jump or if it's a planet far outside a normal system, I start to doubt my own theory of finding it with a scanner. They want us to know where to search before we can find it.

I really need to start reading through the other posts here to find more theories before I start to clutter the whole thread with more random guesses that others may have had way before
