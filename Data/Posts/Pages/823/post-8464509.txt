I wish we could get a definitive list of what's been retconned. it would really save a lot of discussion. I haven't read Out of the Darkness yet. I have it here but I wanted to finish Drew's 2 books first. OOTD seemed kind of like a detecive book from the first 2 pages. Im really looking forward to it.
