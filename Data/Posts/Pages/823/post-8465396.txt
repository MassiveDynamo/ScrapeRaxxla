So I stumbled over this thread randomly while I'm on my first journey and watched the Recording of Drews Stream while jumping around. One thing that got stuck in my head was this "Ghost Planet" thing. I recall that this phrase has been used before, especially when people talk about Planet 9 in our solar system. A planet so far out, that noone really knows if it really exists.
What if "Raxla" is actually such a planet? A planet so far outside that our normal sensors won't pick him up just randomly (that would support the developers wish that noone just randomly stumbles upon it and als would make this brute forcing thing complicated) and maybe our discovery scanner could be the answer there?
I've seen YouTube videos about people finding the voyager probes like that, what if we have to find it the same way?

And even if it's not something like Planet 9, what if it's a rogue planet? A planet without a sun it orbits and is on his own? That could explain how they reached it even before those big jumps where a thing. If it sits in the dark all by itself, flying there manually would be the only solution and it could be easly within 150ly of Sol without anyone noticing.

Sorry if that has already been a theory, it's so much in this thread that could not search through everything while sinking deeper in the Raxxla rabbit hole

Well according to the journal docs (section 14.2) there are rouge planets. I have no idea if anyone has ever discovered one yet.
