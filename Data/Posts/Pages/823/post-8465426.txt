I have no idea if anyone has ever discovered one yet.
Well especially if there is one in the areas where there are big stations already, nobody would scan those properly with an FSS (I hope that's the right term for the scan thingy, punish me if not xD) right?

So if it was possible to find the voyager thing with that method, there should be a way to spot rogue planets with it too, in the end they should have the bigger signature And if they are several LS outside of anything, it would explain why nobody found them on their own.
