Interesting, I wonder if the blue-green gas giant could be related to the Glowing Green Giants here, no Blue-Green though. These gas giants are very, very rare, and no Blue-Green found as of yet.

Glowing Green Giants - The Definitive List
Most gas giants, even those which are classified as "life-bearing", are not particularly rare - about one system in ten seems to have a life-bearing one, with either "water-based life" or "ammonia-based life". They're so common that Universal Cartographics do not pay any premium for them at all...
