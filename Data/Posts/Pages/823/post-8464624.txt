Even Lyra is known as a bird in many cultures. Often the vulture. This makes things a bit more unclear (if that is possible ) .

Perfectly consistent imo. ED is built on a lot mainly Egyptian motifs including the Vulture.

In Ancient Egypt, the vulture hieroglyph was the uniliteral sign used for the glottal sound (/ɑː/). The bird was held sacred to Isis in ancient Egyptian religion. The use of the vulture as a symbol of royalty in Egyptian culture and their protection by Pharaonic law made the species common on the streets of Egypt and gave rise to the name "pharaoh's chicken".[84][85][86][87] (emphasis mine)
