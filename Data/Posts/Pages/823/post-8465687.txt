Hmm I guess you are right, but a rogue planet does not have to travel super fast or anything, we already know about some stellar objects that slowly move through the universe. So it would not be too far off that it would be the same like the voyager thingy - you should be able to spot it with your scanners if it's in the system, but it should be pretty far away from the primary parts of the star system.
I could be 200% wrong btw and actually have no clue on how Elite works in that regard, I just found the similarity in wording interesting for Planet 9 in Sol and Raxxla being "Ghost Planets". Sorry btw that this whole topic has already been discussed, I did not find it while scrolling through the posts.^^'
