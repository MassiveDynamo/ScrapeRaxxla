The rogue planet theory has been bandied about a good bit. The problem with it, from my perspective, is that I dont think it would work within the game mechanics. As is, you jump into a system and the game creates it. This is all based on stars and their orbiting bodies. If there was truly a "rogue planet," how would the game "draw it" and how would you find it? To my mind the game is billions of little cubes that you can jump into. I dont know that theres a mechanic whereby Stellar Forge can migrate data across those cubes.
