A collection of random thoughts since watching the latest video from Drew Wagar's Unofficial Lore Tour:

Janszoon Station in Teorge sounds a lot like Jameson - could he have been a clone?

The era of the first mention of Raxxla (2296) is such that long range hyperspace travel was not possible and such hyperspace as they had was not widely available. Barring a misjump, I think there's a good chance that a very long supercruise journey is involved, perhaps 0.5LY or more. Tau Ceti might be the system to look in, if a heading can be figured out. The catch is that heading had better be very accurate as if you're only slightly out you won't be anywhere near your target after half a light year of supercruise travel.

The Jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies: I know this has been discussed to death and Zeta Cas is the best candidate. Probably. I was thinking that R Cor Australis might be an alternative. The Coronet Pulsar is nearby. Reading the alleged TDW toast this way, it might be to go to the Coronet Pulsar and perform a neutron-boosted jump with 'The parent's grief, the lover's woe and the yearning of our vagabond hearts' defining a triangle of celestial objects that you have to find a target star between. Maybe choosing the right object will result in the navigation system dropping you out at Raxxla... .
