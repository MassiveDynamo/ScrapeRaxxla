Possibly this might just be telling us exactly that, Raxxla was found, and is being exploited. Maybe it is our jump technology, maybe we are all alread in Raxxla, maybe it’s a simulation.

Maybe the path is more important than the destination.

It’s the friends you make along the way
To misquote Douglas Adams:

“There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what Raxxla is for and where it is, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable.

There is another theory which states that this has already happened.”
