I think it is certainly worth considering the question of what Raxxla might be used for and might have been used for in the past. Why it was used is also a reasonable question.
To consider what Raxxla might be used for first you must know what Raxxla is... and we don't know according to DB

As the only bonafide in-game clue/source that we know of "the Codex" (If you believe it... and please excuse me all those who consider historic lore, literature, mythology, etc as valid - just as valid an assumption in my opinion, which I also explore from time to time.....) unless I've missed something Raxxla would be:

1. A definite place that holds a mysterious secret - well good luck with that one as it could be anything!
2. Raxxla contains an alien artefact called the Omphalos Rift, which acts as a gateway to parallel universes. - Travel and probably a face to face with Thargoids, Guardian AI or just a weird version of ourselves (Starfield replay joke!)
3. An unremarkable moon - nothing? How disappointing...
4. A state of cosmic enlightenment - you'll feel happier!
5. A place that has already been discovered by either a sinister cabal or a lone individual who has harnessed Raxxla's power to become the shadow ruler of all of humanity. - Mmm... what power and how? allowing you to jump between systems, propaganda (Galnet?), control markets, pay you to do large scale missions, etc.... Damn you PF!

just a thought...
