Today I was trying to find systems in the line between the centroids of the triangles made up of the Norse Norns and Greek Fates but found Urd was hundreds of LY away. Rochester, could you please label the systems you used to make these triangles in your most recent posts? (e.g. https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/page-1648#post-10297089)

Something else I have been thinking about is the golden chain. The fact it is golden suggests to me that we might be looking for a line or path of G-type stars that starts on the brow of heaven and descends a short way into the realm of Chaos, culminating in the system with Raxxla.
Veroandi and Skuld are both G-type stars. In a line between them are the permit-locked G-type star systems Hors and Pi Mensae. Look in the Galmap, set for G-type stars only, and there are many systems with interesting system names, often empty systems, nearby. Tiliala is another permit-locked G-type. Proteus is one name that stood out (empty).
If we can find a good starting point in this region, then I think we ought to be able to narrow down our search considerably.
