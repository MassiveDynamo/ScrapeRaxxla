So I tried flying out quite a way from other things in Barnard's Star .88LY (I was trying something out) then I thought I wonder if the landscape signal was any different/clearer being so far out... and I don't think so

But as I was playing around with various configurations in the Spectrogram settings (as I am no expert and just play with them and see if things get clearer or completely messed up! )...

Anyway some of the chirps seem to have definite markings/symbols and I wondered if anyone else thinks that.... and whether they are intentional or just the pictorial representation of the chirps?

....and then I also noticed something that looked a bit weird.... faint and possible letters? (the last red boxes to the right of the screen cap)...

Most likely caught a bad case of Rochester Apophenia.... but looks like something to me....

Anyone agree... and anyone understand the spectrogram settings enough to try and see if it can be made clearer or is it just random and I'm seeing things?

Here's a rubbish larger view:



And here a colour version many times from the recording... it's consistant...

Just a thought...

EDIT: almost forgot also saw this in the spectrogram...
