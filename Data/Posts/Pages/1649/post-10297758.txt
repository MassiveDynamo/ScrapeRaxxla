Difficult to know.

Is Raxxla physical, if so exploration ought to be enough - you assess the general location and apply brute force.

But if there is some sole tyrant or cabal, it makes it more difficult, because they would be hidden by default… unless they are not (it’s a game).

I think the Codex is giving us direct landmark clues. And I suspect every aspect is intentional, that its function is to draw our focus, and that if it’s hidden - behind a faction, that clue logically ought to be in the Codex and evident in game, or have some allegorical wider meaning?

Again, difficult to assess - personally I think it’s too wide presently - but if we can figure out certain segments then our confidence might grow about ‘where’ to look, I think whatever presents itself then ought to stick out, and possibly make sense?

Who knows…maybe it doesn’t make sense… maybe it’s simpler than all that
