Can I just ask, are you doing this in freecam at max range? Because that looks like cockpit noise to me.

If you're doing this in freecam 3km from the ship, then you've found something that doesn't appear in any of my (many many many) recordings! Which is amazingly fantastic!

FYI as for:

If you're too near a star you get interference from it in the form of horizontal banding. But as long as you're in "deep space" it seems to be pretty consistently clear
That would explain it ... however think I need to do some more tests on internal ship noises.... not 100% sure it's the same timing when I am pointing at different parts of space..... and why the chirping in a DBX.... not exactly the ship creaking and banging that I usually hear with the sound down a lot more....
