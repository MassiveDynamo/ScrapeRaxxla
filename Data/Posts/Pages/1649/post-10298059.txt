From my FD quotes thread (see signature):

MB: DJTruthsayer [TIQ] Michael Brookes Lore interview 14May2016

01:40:45 DJT: We put the first question in as a joke, I’m astounded you’re going to answer. MB: Well, you're assuming you’ll get a sensible answer...DJT: Where is Raxxla? MB: Where is Raxxla? ”Well, It's in the Milky Way, but I can't tell you where at this stage, it's a journey that everyone has to travel for themselves". DJT: You have always said there will be no clues. MB: "that is true, but I think you have to make some of it a tiny little bit obvious just so that people know what they are doing, there is nothing to be revealed at this stage"

He said Raxxla is in the Milky Way; I don't think he ever said anything about a gateway to Raxxla, the only source for that is the Codex mention of an Omphalos Rift:

"Several versions of the Raxxla story mention an alien artefact, the Omphalos Rift, described as a gateway or tunnel through which parallel universes can be accessed. These details, however, were later shown to bear a striking resemblance to the children's story Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars, and soon lost credibility. Undaunted, some Raxxla seekers insisted that the story's author had cunningly concealed facts about the mysterious locale in his book as hints for those with eyes to see."

So the Rift is not definite, only some versions of the Raxxla story mention it, and if you assume it is true what then is Raxxla and how does it relate to the OR? So the OR may either be total obfuscation or should be interpreted as part of the children's story "clue" which we don't understand...Astrophil & Stella AFAIK doesn't mention an Omphalos, nor does Elite Legacy (either as part of the main story or as part of the children's story that was Julia's sole possession growing up).
