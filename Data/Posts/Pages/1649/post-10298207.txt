Today I was trying to find systems in the line between the centroids of the triangles made up of the Norse Norns and Greek Fates but found Urd was hundreds of LY away. Rochester, could you please label the systems you used to make these triangles in your most recent posts? (e.g. https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/page-1648#post-10297089)

Sorry false of habit, eventually mapping so many systems their locations and names just get engraved into one’s subconscious.


There is also the ‘Thorn’ systems, runic names attributed to trees (still under construction).
