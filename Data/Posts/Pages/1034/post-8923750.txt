Welcome to the club!
Your vid is interesting -you were in sector 21 I think & I would say below the light source and it might be in front of you. Can’t read the sol distance but you were near the middle of the belt width so I’d guess around 1380 ls. Can’t see from your vid your orientation -where were the Magellanic Clouds and where was the orbit line of Jupiter?

Hi Jorki - ya distance was 1560 ls I was facing clockwise. And ya guess i will have to root around in the options to turn on sector numbers in the Orrey - I wonder if there is a turn on Raxxla setting in there too...
