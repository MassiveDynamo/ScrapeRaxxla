After experimenting for a while with overlaying the Raxxla logo I ran into some alignment issues, namely that the corridors never appear to totally line up with the Orrery view regardless of it's rotation. Here are two examples:

It's probably just an artistic technique. This is the Raxxla logo, made by an artist, not an engineer. If you divide the logo into designs, it turns out that there is a circle and there is an equilateral hexagon with one center. The logo is the image of the map, not the map itself.
