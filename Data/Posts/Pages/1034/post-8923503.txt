Ah, no ... I've been lazy in my combat rank effort so am only 'Master' at the moment. However I've done plenty of Wing assassination missions solo in my Vette but won't help here if I canâ€™t get the mission in the first place!

This is certainly something FDev could track as a subtle test of skill discretely administered, and hence a lock out progress towards an Invite for TDW.

Has anyone received this mission type from TDW in another system?

Edit: - Re-read the message, it's trade rank which I am Elite in... so we'll see.

Well nothing happened when I delivered the fish (as expected as I didn't have a mission), but TDW is pretty keen to get me do to stuff, got another mission almost straight away? I thought these were rare, or perhaps I've stumbled upon a trigger sequence which I'll verify over the coming week?

SPOILER: ANOTHER USS_TYPE_TRADINGBEACON








Unfortunately, delivering the HE suites lead to just a successful mission completion ... ah well, I'll keep plugging away on this line of investigation whilst you others explore the strange green glow.
