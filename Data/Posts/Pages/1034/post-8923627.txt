Perhaps a small rotation will still be required, but we can define this as an acceptable inaccuracy. I superimposed your image, the Raxxla logo, and my division by sector, which coincides with the number of dashed lines. This is an amazing coincidence! I am sure that this theory is the most working at the moment, especially based on the presence of a green glow in the game! Your video is the most important piece of evidence.

Not just my videos! now we're getting more evidence in something interesting seems to be apparent.
SparklePaws vivid glow: sector 29 above belt, Sol 1446 ls, Heading to Sol, direction to light source: above left aft
SparklePaws weak glow: sector 10 below belt, Sol 1325 ls, Sol to Right heading towards left of BLoop, light source righ & aft
Clixer weak glow: sector 15 but thought he was up near 1 (Jupiter nearerest planet!) & asteroid cluster showing, Sol 1501 ls, heading to Sol Magellanic Clous below ship, light source aft.

Now Clixer had altered hud lighting (Purple theme) & this didn't affect appearance of the green glow, which showed at same time as an asterid cluster. SparklePaws one video showed glow fairly soon after losing a cluster.

I'm beginning to think there perhaps is an RNG factor involved here linking appearance of an asterouid cluster to a green glow. Need more evidence!
