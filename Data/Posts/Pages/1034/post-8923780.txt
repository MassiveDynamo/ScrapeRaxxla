It's probably just an artistic technique. This is the Raxxla logo, made by an artist, not an engineer. If you divide the logo into designs, it turns out that there is a circle and there is an equilateral hexagon with one center. The logo is the image of the map, not the map itself.

i think it would be interesting to see how it looked if (1) the sector map outer circle matched the dotted line hexagon, and (2) the dotted line matched the middle of the sectors .
Can you try those & post please for comparison?
