Unfortunately I haven't had time to watch them all and look for patterns, hopefully this is useful to someone.

Very interestink!!
That first one of Spliffz is about the strongest I've seen the glow. Interestingly he was only about 1100 ls from Sol, heading away from Sol towards Jupiter, & quite a way above the plane of the belt. Light source seems to be astern.

The last one, with the external cam, is disappointing, in that I can't see any sign of an external light source that would cause this glow (although seems weak in this example).
So is it a lighting bug after all???
