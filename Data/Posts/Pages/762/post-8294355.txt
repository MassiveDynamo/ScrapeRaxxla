Ok so, back to tip-off missions. Has anyone else gotten a tip-off for the same place while the first one was still active?

I have 2 for the exact same cords, both active. Ive done perhaps ten of these so far, typically waiting till the last minute since im usually bgs'ing and have lots of inf and bounties im responsible for. This is a first ive had two of the same, in a row and only 15 days apart. Also, i accidentally bought the really flimsy cheap tinfoil and the gremlins in my ship latrine keep saying i should ignore this

No I haven't but I don't get many at all atm. The last one you posetd a few pages back, I had that one 3 days earlier and went there myself before you posted. That one is a Tharg site not a crashed ship so not all crashed ships.

Theories:

RP - No reason why 2 people in 2 separate stations wouldn't hear about the sqme thing from the same or different source, so nor reason why 2 people wouldn't give you the same tip off location.

Probably RNG and so many the likelihood of getting the same one twice are small but it can happen.

Possibly time limted - a certain number of sites are available each time period and thats why you got 2 - unlikely as sure other main thread all have appeared in same period and then reset and repeated.

Listen to the gremlins probably, it was desgined to give tip offs to interesting places or new sights to see such as crashes and thargs, probably based around Horizons to encourage more use or as a reward / easter egg for buying it.
