Finished scanned all FL-Y systems I could locate, nothing special thus far. Very beautiful systems with lots of gas giants, well worth the visit.

I'm interested in coming back shortly for another search, after doing the math I found that the "arrow" trajectory passes right through the Jewel Box sector (I'm exhausted and need sleep but I'll post the numbers later). I'd be surprised if there isn't a tourist beacon around here, the area and very scenic.

Looks from the Tourist Beacon list that some are still undiscovered. Hope anybody finding one reports it, or any new LP/UCB (see the link in my signature) - for science!
