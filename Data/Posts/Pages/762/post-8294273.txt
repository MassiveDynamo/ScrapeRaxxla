Here's another goose chase. I was looking at Wregoe XQ-L c21-29 on the gal map and realized another marker I had for future exploration was directly over witch heads. NGC 2632. It's top most part stops directly over which heads nebula. It's other end is pointing straight at the bubble or something. It's a big loose star cluster. It's one of the giant nebulas I wanted to eventually fully explor.
Does this have a connection to the search somehow that you forgot to include?
