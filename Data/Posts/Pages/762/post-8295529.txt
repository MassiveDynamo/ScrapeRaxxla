Cupid's Arrow

It was! But I enjoyed the read, however not convinced. I’m not really in favour of the mythological approach, as I’ve said before. The trouble is that the various mythologies (all of them Greek, Roman, etc etc) are full of characters that could fit TDW toast. Doomed lovers, parental grief etc are a common theme. How do we narrow down the choices?
