The Greek mythos is important in ED. Not just to finding Raxxla, but as a link to distant galactic history. All the ancient myths and religions tells basically the same stories. I have a suspicion that these stories, in the context of ED, were told to humans by extra terrestrial visitors in the distant past. These stories had locations and characters that were not relatable to humans, so they were changed into mythological characters(gods, monsters and other creatures).

Thargoids may represent the monsters of the myths. The wild and untamed forces, that gods and heroes have to defeat. Thargoids mostly hang out in the southern sky, thus having a connection to the mythological underworld.

Guardians may represent the Titans in the Greek pantheon. The early rulers that were defeated by their own children, the Contructs(AI).

According to the Orphic myth, Zeus destroyed the Titans with his thunderbolts(nuclear strike), because the Titans had murdered and devoured his son Zagreus (Dionysus). From the smouldering ashes, mankind were created(modification of human genome with partly guardian DNA).

It's probably not exactly like this, but something in that direction feels plausible.
