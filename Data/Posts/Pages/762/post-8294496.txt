Ok so, back to tip-off missions. Has anyone else gotten a tip-off for the same place while the first one was still active?

I have 2 for the exact same cords, both active. Ive done perhaps ten of these so far, typically waiting till the last minute since im usually bgs'ing and have lots of inf and bounties im responsible for. This is a first ive had two of the same, in a row and only 15 days apart. Also, i accidentally bought the really flimsy cheap tinfoil and the gremlins in my ship latrine keep saying i should ignore this

It’s been reported before. Probably an artefact of the way TO missions are rng’d
