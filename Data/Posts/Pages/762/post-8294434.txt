This was on my map then not on my map. I assume it's a glitch or a companion star that stopped showing up. Anyone seen this before?! I'm refering to the weird white star next to theta carinae.

Originally, it would not go away, even if I changed the star I was focused on. Now it's just nowhere to be found.

I've never seen a star like that before.

Glitch? Warping star?! Raxxla?
