How close are you from the origin point of its boxel? (to cross-check Canonn's hypothesis that it points to one)
TBH, unknown. At the moment, I don't understand Boxel as a means of navigation. I followed the grid available when in the Galactic Map. At 2.8ly from Juenae WC-E C1-437 I started to get further from Stuemeae JM-W C1-5825. (.68ly was as close as I got) I finally ended that journey and went back for repairs. I then moved to the various systems closest to the signal location and checked both the signal direction and orrey map, hoping to find the "base system". I have learned 3 things;
1- It is likely that the signal is tied to a specific system. It is not possible (in game) to supercruise from one system to the next. We have to Hyperspace Jump to interact with different systems instances.
2- This boxel has to be the means of finding the signal system. It has to be as based on my own actions and the research paper from CMDR PublicStaticVoid, the audio locating does not point to a single point.
3- Just a hunch, but after watching a 3yr old MATTIUS vid on this Signal, we might need to trigger an event. My theory is to bring a Guardian Artifact along and jump around these systems. Maybe bring a Thargoid artifact and do the same. A long shot but worth mentioning, bring the Martian Relic. Even modest explorers would not think twice about the distance required to get here and to do it, like myself, ditched useless mass. Like a cargo hold.
This shall be my last entry in this thread regarding the Landscape Signal. It makes sense to continue this endeavor here.
"So long and thanks for all the fish!"
