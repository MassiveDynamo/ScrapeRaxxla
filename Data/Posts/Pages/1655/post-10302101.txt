signal doesnt change i presume
Sadly not, nothing I've tried altered the signal, unfortunately.

More specifically: it combined the Landscape Signal with the sound of Sgr A*, since the Landscape Signal can be 'heard' through everything in space, but it didn't seem to significantly add or remove anything in a meaningful way.
