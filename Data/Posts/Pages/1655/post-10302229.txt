That gives me one idea.
In my earlier post on the "Milton Gardens" in stations I had thought of the Pillars of Earth holding up the world within the great cosmic ocean.
I know by this time in our future the Pillars of Creation in the Eagle Nebula are due to be blasted away by a nearby supernova, but perhaps by attempting to follow the symbolic interpretation of each sphere in that garden, it could at least be a start to locating another clue / signal / location. So places that involve the mythological mountains / pillars that hold up the earth / sky / world / universe could be a good start.

The last time I was out there I was jumping in a Cobra with only 25LY range
