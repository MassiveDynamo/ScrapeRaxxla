From what I understand of the early Canonn report the signal is effectively galaxy-wide so long as you are roughly pointed towards the source, correct?

So if there was another 'map' piece shouldn't it also be detectable from a certain direction anywhere in the galaxy? Unless it takes a different form it seems fairly implausible to have a companion source somewhere else.

Similarly if it's an object floating in the void between stars, the game will only generate content from the star system you arrived into, so you would need to supercruise from multiple nearby systems to actually stumble across this thing.... quite a formidable effort.

To be clear this doesn't prove that it is not a map piece or object, but it does indicate that the signal itself is likely a standalone piece of information. Possibly to guide us NEARBY the location of another clue. Basically a game of galactic Hot & Cold
