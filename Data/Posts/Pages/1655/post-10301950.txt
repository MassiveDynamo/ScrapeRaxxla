2- This boxel has to be the means of finding the signal system. It has to be as based on my own actions and the research paper from CMDR PublicStaticVoid, the audio locating does not point to a single point.
The origin of the signal seems to exist between any known systems. My post here shows a 3D image of that area of space (and my post a couple later shows some more) that combine the Canonn theory with the IRH original identification. Your own investigation is also in the same vicinity.



I personally remain sceptical about Canonn's theory about the boxel corner, since Fdev have confirmed that the Landscape Signal is "working as designed", therefore it's placement is as it's supposed to be.

I do think we're supposed to have done exactly what you and many of us have done, tracked the signal to approximately that location and determine that the origin lies between systems - therefore unreachable by conventional means. I also do think (as per my previous post here and many others recently) that the Raxxla Codex points us towards the Landscape Signal - and therefore it does belong here if you want to keep posting on this thread

As I've said before, that really leaves two options:
We're supposed be trying to figure out how to get to that un-reachable location.
We're not supposed to reach the source*, and therefore we're supposed to use it in some other way.
I lean towards #2

* yet?
