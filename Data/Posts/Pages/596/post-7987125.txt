Not sure if there are individual locked systems out in the black, but they'd be tricky to find.
There are, but we don’t speak of them as they were found using nefarious means.

(Well, when I say ‘we’... they were kind of ok’d to be talked about, so it’s more a matter of personal principle really. Cheating’s cheating, so they remain firmly on my personal ignore/disregard list.)
