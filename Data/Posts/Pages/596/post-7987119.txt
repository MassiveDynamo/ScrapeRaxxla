So do you think it is in locked? ...then that toast could be tip for unlock order, for example u need unlock 3-6 common systems, then will provide instruction to go somewhere else, for example Polaris.
Does anybody have all unlocked in bubble?
I don't think it's locked. I wouldn't rule it out completely though.

I think Raxxla is invisible to system scan and could be in any system we have visited, without us noticing. It is after all, a ghost world. This is just a guess.
