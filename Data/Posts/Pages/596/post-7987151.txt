Like I already said, I can't understand why FD needs so many reserved sectors to proceed with their development...
Who believes they actually are going to put content in that many millions of systems?

Obfuscated.

They should of added dates to these sectors on how long they have been locked. If it been locked since release were coming up to almost 5 yrs for them being locked. Considering the development of the game and these large chunks of space locked most likely looking at a good huge portion of over 200,000 systems locked depending on the density of each sector they got a long way to go.

They would need a larger team just to cover the ground of this stuff if they are aiming to add content to these sectors. With the final portion of Beyond coming close and waiting on the next info of the next Chapter of Elite Dangerous content. If the next content doesn't do anything with at least one of these locked systems geez they have really reach for too much just to establish any sort content driven narrative.
