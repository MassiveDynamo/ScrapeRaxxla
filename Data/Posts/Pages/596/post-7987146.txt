The security permit one, yes.
Other two seem legit.
There were two dodgily found ones IIRC, both Security Permits. Nice to see the CoR being principled about it in their list (wouldn’t expect any less).

Anyway, I see what you mean, it’s just one line for it in the CoR doc.

What’s the other two you were meaning?
