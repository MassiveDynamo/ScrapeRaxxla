Yesterday I made progress on 2 fronts; it seems that the black box missions have more to them in the sense that the black boxes actually talk. I recorded 10 mins of apparent noise and black box beacon signal, looked at it in Audacity and boom, I heard a voice apparently saying "This is never gonna stop Clay, this challenge will never stop" repeatedly throughout the stream. So, this means more black box recordings and analysis to see if the recordings have different messages, and hopefully some of them with more meaning than this first one.

Great finding, Macros!
This looks like a major breakthrough, congratz and rep for you!
Unfortunately, I'm not in the bubble, but i think here are more than enough good CMDR's to deal with it.

Question: Are there any hints of nebulae in the near of Raxxla? (I have arrived at my first nebula in the north-western quadrant)

EDIT: And here is my finding: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=116450&page=27&p=2736156&viewfull=1#post2736156
