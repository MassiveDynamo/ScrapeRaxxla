I and I Redeye said:
I revised your numbers.
I made a little mistake before.

Here it is, the new number:

R A X X L A
5 1 3 3 2 1

Ok now is see, why you come up with 6/6/3...

Interesting, how did you get the allotted numbers in the first place?

Oh and btw, the distance from Sirius to Sol is 8,6 Ly XD

Edit:
Read today that the "Planet Osiris" is in the system "HD 209458".
It is in Elite, as a populated HIP system.

Edit2:
Bast, the system where multiple UAs where seen has only one planet,
called "THFC-EST1882" so the "12" and the "8" has another appearance.
