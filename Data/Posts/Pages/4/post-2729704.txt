Hello CMDR's!

I am new to this thread but already fascinated from the search. So count me in.
Actual i am on an exploration tour in the core. As seen in one of the first post's here, RAXXLA has been associated with the numbers:
RA = 18 1
XX = 24 24
LA = 12 1
So i changed it in:
RA = 181
X = 24
XLA = 24 12 1

This coordinates (181 : 24 : 24.121) are near my position and i will take a look.
Yes i know, it is far-fetched, but its only a detour of about 300 LY.
I will report back, if i will found something.

But generally, count me in. If someone has a theory wich leads somewhere into the core, i can check it out!

EDIT: Sadly, there is nothing on the excact coordinates. Around it, i only found one system with (possible) interesting characteristica:


Hello, Cmdr!
You are most welcome to help out in any way, shape or form.

Good to know that we now have an agent in the core
