If we choose to interpret the mission "Obfuscated In The Outer Rim" as the outer edges of the galaxy, then map 7 would absolutely be part of a hint. Discovering new areas in the rim would be valuable even should we not locate Raxxla there, then for the Galactic mapping project. I know this is precious little to go on, but hey, that's why it's a quest

Good luck should you choose to go there, Cmdr, and send back pretty pictures!


Thanks CMDR Macros.
I will go to the nebulae on the way to the upper-left rim.
So it's one of the least visited areas, so perhaps i stumble over Raxxla!
