I'm joinin the search, for the moment I'll just follow the thread, when I finish helping with the UA (plan to retrieve and test with an UA for a while, then move on but keep following the UA thing) I'll start actively looking for Raxxla

You are most welcome, Cmdr, in any way, shape or form you wish
