"This is never gonna stop Clay, this challenge will never stop"

Yesterday I made progress on 2 fronts; it seems that the black box missions have more to them in the sense that the black boxes actually talk. I recorded 10 mins of apparent noise and black box beacon signal, looked at it in Audacity and boom, I heard a voice apparently saying "This is never gonna stop Clay, this challenge will never stop" repeatedly throughout the stream. So, this means more black box recordings and analysis to see if the recordings have different messages, and hopefully some of them with more meaning than this first one.

On the second front, I discovered the Dark Wheel diplomatic missions, actually they had been staring me in the face the whole time disguised as "Sealing The Deal" missions. Dough!

This of course warrant more data analysis encompassing all 5 missions to find patterns, e.g. which station/faction has had all the 5 missions.

On a side note I made a another little discovery with respect to the BGS. I took a "Steal 8 clothing" mission, stopped by a SSS in an unpopulated system and found the usual Hafnium 178 type convoy with a T9 and 2 Anaconda's; only this time the T9 were carrying 1 clothing! - this cargo must certainly have been put there due to my current clothing mission, although I thought it a bit excessive to protect clothing so excessively, must be that federal security takes fashion very seriously
