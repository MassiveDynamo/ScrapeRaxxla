Back from my big explore and elite,so ready to search for the legendry raxxala.
Only run a few of the missions so far,early days but seems to me I don't get these missions everywhere but certain areas and systems,many yes but not everywhere.

Was thinking of mapping where and which factions apply to see if there's any link or pattern.

Good idea, will be interesting to see the results. I've tried to keep the number of systems to a minimum, and the pattern I've seen so far is that missions only tends to be given once for a given to/from system/station/faction, although I have seen a few duplicates, i.e. the exceptions to confirm the rule.

In order for factions to give the missions, you also need a high enough rep to attain the missions. When things started slow, I took the other missions and soon the Elite missions began to appear.
