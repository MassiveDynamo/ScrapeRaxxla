Thank you a lot, CMDR!
Are there any interesting places in the upper regions of our galaxy?
In the community-map 7 (i think) i only see a few discovered regions, so many others to explore.
Are there any hints in the missions from the dark wheel which I could pursue?

If we choose to interpret the mission "Obfuscated In The Outer Rim" as the outer edges of the galaxy, then map 7 would absolutely be part of a hint. Discovering new areas in the rim would be valuable even should we not locate Raxxla there, then for the Galactic mapping project. I know this is precious little to go on, but hey, that's why it's a quest

Good luck should you choose to go there, Cmdr, and send back pretty pictures!
