Ok now is see, why you come up with 6/6/3...

Interesting, how did you get the allotted numbers in the first place?

Oh and btw, the distance from Sirius to Sol is 8,6 Ly XD

Edit:
Read today that the "Planet Osiris" is in the system "HD 209458".
It is in Elite, as a populated HIP system.

Edit2:
Bast, the system where multiple UAs where seen has only one planet,
called "THFC-EST1882" so the "12" and the "8" has another appearance.


New numbers I am working with.

R A X X L A G A T E W A Y
30 6 18 18 12 6 42 6 42 30 24 6 12

It's not hard science so I wont delve too deep. It more to do with correlation and comparision.

Julio, I will prolly have to make another post so not to derail this one. I need to display the chart for you which will take up space.
Then I can write my findings and others can check to see if any co-ords or info. It looks (very)interesting so far but I need to test some other things.
I'm also seeing if there is anything in the audio numbers but again, the answer is a little simpler and in game.

Missons have a hidden rank system. I think this is where the answer could be.
