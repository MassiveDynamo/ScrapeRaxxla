yep, been playing in their smog for several hours
they are quite peaceful if you don't move fast.
I'm in a courier doing 12 m/s and all they do is surround me.
not one ship has touched me yet.
only corrosive has been a pain..
picked up a corrosive shard, its new...rebuy screen...
watching them is interesting.
troublemaker goids in there too scanning everything..

seems to be a number of cmdrs poking around in the smog.

p.s. fwiw the clue fdev gave seems accurate.
if you bother the 'guards' they signal for help
they don't seem to mind me if I move slow.
from experience, speed kills.
