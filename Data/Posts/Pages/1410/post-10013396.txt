So, who's going to continue to Quest in Live, and who in Legacy?

I did ask fo confirmation that it had been recently accessibility tested for both, but don't honestly expect an answer
Elite Dangerous Legacy (3.8) Is Now Available | IMPORTANT RELEASE INFORMATION
Sunya, so sorry for the delay. Are you still having issues? Nah, most of my friends likewise had to wait 10+ minutes for it to begin tracking the install progress. On console and on Steam it all went fine for everyone I know, just the frontier launcher experiencing this delay.

Trouble is, a lot of changes have been made to the game since the Gamma...a lot errors have been corrected, but a lot of errors have crept in!!

A really good point, something I’ve considered too recently. I’ve held off submitting anything of late, to give FD some grace during the forthcoming updates, but might try casting something at them closer to the holidays, in the hope the Xmas party loosens their grip on information

I’m mooted to Legacy myself, my dinosaur PC won’t run 4.0 let alone Odyssey and I won’t buy a new one just for the sake of 1 game; for ease of access I’m predominantly on PS4 so yup in the legacy pile.

Which suits me fine, I care not for Jackanory narratives nor Goid bashing. 3.8 looks better too.

But yes; it’s a valid question: I won’t address it directly around Raxxka, but technically FD will have a closed end game with two Codex entries which point to in game content. Logically if they leave those entries in game they are confirmed (to potential new owners predominately) those are still in Legacy and ‘accessible’ in Legacy?

If they are not, what would that tell us mmm?
