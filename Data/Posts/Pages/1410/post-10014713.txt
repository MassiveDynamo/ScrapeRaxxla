I really just wanna say, the neutron stars making a sound like a whisper after cleaning up is really, genuinely cool! But it doesn't match the codex entry, and is therefore very likely apophenia.

"To the whisperer in witch-space, the siren of the deepest void!" is the line.

Finding a thing that matches a single word from the codex is really cool, but...

Example:


All of these things exist in game. It's the Engineer symbol, Mycoid symbol, Raxxla logo. All three are rare examples in Elite of hexagons with circles in the middle. The Mycoid symbol even has a circumpunct in the middle like the Raxxla logo.

But I'm sure you'll agree that this is apophenia.

The similarity of these three logos doesn't mean they are connected, the similarity doesn't help understand a clue or add any detail to it. It's likely just a coincidence of a design and shapes, right? Apophenia.

There are thousands(?) of neutron stars. I'm open to the idea of this being a big breakthrough but, again, I just want to know: how does a cleaned audio of a neutron star in FSS sounding like a whisper relate to anything in the codex clues? How does it add to the clues we have, or lead to new stuff? What's the next step? How does that add details or help us understand clues?
