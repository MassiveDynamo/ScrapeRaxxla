my take on SDW is to go by what Felicity says.
we were never meant to manipulate the BGS, but many of us did, it became the game.
I can say from first hand experience that no cmdr's BGS can affect lore or ongoing story.

that aside if a person were to try to find any missions related to this, it is likely they are within 25LY of SD.
in the beginning it was rare to find places further away than an expansion's length away that did missions to nearby systems.
and ofc the competition factor means in system as well.
the bad part is by the SDW having been expanded , where they go, missions to help and hurt them follow. So now there will be way more misleading missions than there could have been before.
