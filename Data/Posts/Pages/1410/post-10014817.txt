There are thousands(?) of neutron stars. I'm open to the idea of this being a big breakthrough but, again, I just want to know: how does a cleaned audio of a neutron star in FSS sounding like a whisper relate to anything in the codex clues? How does it add to the clues we have, or lead to new stuff? What's the next step? How does that add details or help us understand clues?
You could argue that it relates to the codex of the "spiralling stars" story.
