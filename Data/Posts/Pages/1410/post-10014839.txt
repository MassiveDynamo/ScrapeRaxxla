You could argue that it relates to the codex of the "spiralling stars" story.
True, but the question remains, how does that add more detail and give any more indication of a path to follow than the correlation with the Thargoid spiralling starmap, or assuming it means the galaxy itself, or assuming it means Andromeda, or, honestly, even the spinning (spiralling) stars around the edge of a witchspace tunnel?

That's kinda the issue. Too many things match a single word or phrase taken out of context and it's pretty easy to build a wobbly house on that foundation.

Obvioulsy a lot of people do that by reading the word "Raxxla" in alignments of names on Galmp, or read Alien World, which literally just has the word "Raxxla" in it and they build a complex theory based on that.

You may as well build a theory around this:

Matching a single word out of context, like finding something that "whispers" is always really valuable and exciting but the very next step has to be to take in the wider context and ask "how does this make sense, how does this help? How does it add more to the investigation". That's really all I'm asking here.
