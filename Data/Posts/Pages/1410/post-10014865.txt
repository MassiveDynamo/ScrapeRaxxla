I will revert back to one of my first posts here.

I get the feeling that over the years we have taken this and are massively over thinking it lol
My path is based on points A - F and i have not found A yet,
That being said, one of the videos you linked on a system being 34km away and being able to jump to it. I have seen that before and dismissed it. as a glitch for multiple stars in the same system. but the system only had one star.
I am now clawing my mind to find where i was, but i went there from a theory regarding Raxxla and the first line .
