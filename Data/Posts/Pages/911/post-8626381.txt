Btw...do fdev have any woman who could be responsible to create galaxy? Then she could be mother, and there is some place (star/station/planet) in her name..
Technically, Stellar Forge itself would be the mother of the ED galaxy?

Tin foli: if Raxxla was a portal to another galaxy, that galaxy would be proc gen from running Stellar Forge with a different seed, making it the mother of galaxies (plural).

Edit: even without the tin foil, Stellar Forge is client side, not server side, so it could be argued that Stellar Forge is already the nother of 11 million???? galaxies

Edit 2: so is there a system that pays homage to Stella Forge in some way? System name for example? If so, then that would be hand crafted. Another way to say this is "layered on top". Therefore, this system could be "on the brow of the mother of galaxies" - bit of a stretch for sure, but dont think the possibility has been investigated yet, as far as I know
