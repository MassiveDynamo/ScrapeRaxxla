Yes but they are clues that don't specifically point you into a direction more like clues that say RAXXLA is out there mk. I fear RAXXLA was randomly placed in some system and it will be only luck if someone finds it at all. The moment they give us a concrete clue it is only a matter of hours or even minutes until someone finds it like with all the other things that were hidden in the game.
