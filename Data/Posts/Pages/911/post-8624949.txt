Are you saying there is no BM in that system? If not that's weird, unless there is one on a FC and its counting that. Otherwise its working perfectly normally, you didnt know about the BM until you visited the system and now for ever you know its there, whether you docked or used the BM or not is irrelevant. You just know about it from visiting.

RE Trade Data - Same for Compare the Meerkat, its been taken over by GalCompare and now it doesn't work. The button to 'show this market' is missing completely from the GalMap after going through the Compare screen and 'choose system'.

Is there a bug report, Ill upvote it but I can never find the blooming things until after I submit then it suddenly finds 8 that are similar that it couldnt find before!
