I thought Stellar Forge ran on FD’s servers, and then when a pilot jumps towards a system the system description (rng seeds) is provided by Stellar Forge to the pilot’s client and expanded into what we see during the hyperspace transition sequence?

Edit: and “Astrophel and Stella”?
No. It runs client side. There is a good post from Alec Turner here https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threa...ion-of-everything-from-stars-to-rocks.517029/ he confirmed it at a Lavecon
