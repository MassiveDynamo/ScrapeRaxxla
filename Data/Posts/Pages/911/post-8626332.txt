Oh I think there are several clues in the Codex.

And I suspect the behaviour of some NPCs may also be clues to specific things.

So many possible clues to chase....so little time (grandkids visitation threatened again )
And chasing down these Raxxla possibilities is taking a long time....


And I forget to say Happy Yorkshire Day yesterday to you all!
