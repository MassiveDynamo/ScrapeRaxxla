I've been following suspicious npcs recently. A few hours ago i spotted an elite npc in a type-7 with no faction while i was at Dominic's Corner in Pleiades Sector GW-W c1-15 , 12a.

I thought it was suspicious beacause , well basically everything about it seemed unlikely to me. why would an elite combat pilot be in a t7, and with no faction? (Lots of tinfoil sorry) so i followed them as they left to hip 17862 where they flew away in SC for a few kls before they disappeared. Bust.

I figured i might as well scan the system since i hadn't been here before and it turned out to be worth my while. It turns out theres a crashed thargoid ship on one moon and crashed thargoid megaship at another.

Tl;dr: im beginning to think following certain NPCs away from certain POIs may lead to other nearby POIs sometimes. Anyone else notice this too?
