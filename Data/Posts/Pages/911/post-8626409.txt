I thought Stellar Forge ran on FD’s servers, and then when a pilot jumps towards a system the system description (rng seeds) is provided by Stellar Forge to the pilot’s client and expanded into what we see during the hyperspace transition sequence?

Edit: and “Astrophel and Stella”?

Edit2: and step 2 is split into two parts-first decide what Raxxla is, then implement it!
