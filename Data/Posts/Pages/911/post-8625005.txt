Maybe POI NPCs have their own programming or maybe there was nowhere else 'significant' to jump to. Assume the NPC was 'created' at your entry in that instance so was at the 'start' of their journey. Do NPCs just jump around uninhabited, non interest systems on a loop or are they weighted towards flying 'somewhere with something' for the first few jumps maybe, to give 'life ' to them? If no human sites to visit they go to non-human or other POI system unintentionally pointing out there may be something there?

All speculation, backed up by confirmation bias and selective memory.
