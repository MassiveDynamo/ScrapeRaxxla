Good question about clues is ... who was first?
You see, creation contains 3 steps:
1. galaxy itself
2. adding raxxla
3. creation of clues.

So quality and amount of clues will depend on order. For example, if you wrote random poetry (clue), then created galaxy to match - that will be 100% exact way to go.
If you had galaxy & raxxla placed, then tried to make poetry ....that will not so precise and will relay on some external facts like myths. And so on.
