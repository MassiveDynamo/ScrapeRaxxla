I don’t believe Raxxla is an end game, there is a ten year narrative, it doesn’t necessarily mean there is a resolution.

I suspect this narrative is loose and only has a set number of ‘big events’ played out over the years, allowing it to evolve.

Remember the Mars Relic - from day 1 we knew it was narratively locked because M Brookes said so in his development dairies, still no sign of it.

Is it Raxxla?
