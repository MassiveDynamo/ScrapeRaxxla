Yes, thanks that's exactly the same as the links I replied to you with As I said then, I can't see:

anywhere in those logs.

Could you point to me to correct info please? I've never heard about the Guardians and Thargoids being genetically related, I'd love to see that info since it would be even more mind-boggling than Guardians and humans being related - also might well tie into the idea of some ancient 'other', and therefore another path to Raxxla, maybe.
Biology 6: Weâ€™ve barely scratched the surface with the Guardians. There is so much yet to discover. But this new data contains one tantalizing detail that stands out: their biochemistry was very similar to our own. They had blood in the same fashion as us, and it fulfilled exactly the same role as it does for us. Beyond this, they share a similar genetic structure, with DNA and RNA their core building blocks. Although a full analysis has not yet been conducted, this might be evidence of a common ancestor, but also of a branching in their genetic history. This is an astounding discovery!
