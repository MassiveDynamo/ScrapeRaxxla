Cool, interesting replies, thanks. Getting the feeling that generally the assumption is that there are definitely hints then

We know about the Delphi system and it’s historical link to the Omphalos. But recall we only know of this arbitrarily, it wasn’t handed to us, nor uncovered via any clue, it was data-mined (correct if wrong please I actually can’t recall).

Oh data mined stuff on Delphi? What was that? I'm not a fan of spoilers and I disagree strongly with data mining, but this was presumably 4+ years ago so I'm curious what was found, if you wouldn't mind pointing me to that if you can find it. Or DM me if you don't want to make it public (understandably).

As you know I recently went on a "only using the codex as source text" reading of the Raxxla search and ended up at Delphi very quickly and easily, so that's pretty interesting. If there was something datamined a while back that's not there now it might indicate another dead end/moved trail of clues, etc.
