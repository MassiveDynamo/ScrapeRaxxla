The Ram Tah missions tell that the Thargoids and Guardians (and humans) share a common ancient ancestor.
Do they? I don't recall that?!

I'd love to see that text, do you know where it is? I checked the canonn database of the Ram Tah findings but can't see anything that suggests that. https://canonn.science/codex/guardians-codex/? https://canonn.science/codex/guardians-data-culture/? https://canonn.science/codex/guardians-data-biology/

Edit: Never mind! Found it " Although a full analysis has not yet been conducted, this might be evidence of a common ancestor [to humans], but also of a branching in their genetic history. This is an astounding discovery!" Thanks for the reminder, I'd forgotten that even was a thing. That's crazy.

I'm still not seeing the bit about Guardians and Thargoid sharing a common ancestor though?

Who thinks Raxxla is linked to either (or both) Thargoids or Guardians?

Or is it something separate (and therefore new) entirely?
Thanks for the replies So most people seem to think it's something either Guardian or 'other'.

Halsey's dream/vision/encounter certainly does suggest that there's something else out there - maybe not even actually Guardian, but a 'higher' life, the Guardian AI (though no idea why it would interact with Halsey?!), or something else pointing us to Guardian ruins for some reason, or maybe accidentally? I like @Aris Tarkus idea:

A remnant, perhaps, of something far older in the galaxy that is of concern to the Guardians and Thargoids alike

I'd never thought of that!

OK, question: Do you think Ram Tah told us everything? He was very quick to translate the Guardian data. Is he trustworthy? Is there more that's not been told to us?
