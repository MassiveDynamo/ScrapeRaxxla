Biology 6: Weâ€™ve barely scratched the surface with the Guardians. There is so much yet to discover. But this new data contains one tantalizing detail that stands out: their biochemistry was very similar to our own. They had blood in the same fashion as us, and it fulfilled exactly the same role as it does for us. Beyond this, they share a similar genetic structure, with DNA and RNA their core building blocks. Although a full analysis has not yet been conducted, this might be evidence of a common ancestor, but also of a branching in their genetic history. This is an astounding discovery!
Yep, that's the human-Guardian link, but you said:

"The Ram Tah missions tell that the Thargoids and Guardians (and humans) share a common ancient ancestor."

Am I being stupid here?
