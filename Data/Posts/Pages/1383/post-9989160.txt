yes, that relic is a bit of a bother.
not so much as the end but parts that maybe lead that way
it really depends I think, on what it is.
not knowing is why its fun for me.

I have said a few other times I don't really play video games and haven't for so many years.
Because I used to sell Atari hardware and software for all computers and play them and I stopped because there was no more challenge to any of them.
many people become so good most games can be beaten in a day or less.
and so many are like tv shows, an adjusted repeat.

every part of this game is filled with not knowing whats next.
much repeated but the unknown is always there.
