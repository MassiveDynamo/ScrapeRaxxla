The Ram Tah missions tell that the Thargoids and Guardians (and humans) share a common ancient ancestor.
They don't actually say that, what they say is that Guardians had a similar biology to humans. And Thargoids from what we know have a very different biology.

Ram Tah does speculate about there being a common ancestor, but as it stands that's all it is, Ram Tah's personal speculation.


On the matter of a common ancestor, the issue with that idea is that the fundamentals of human biology can be traced back on Earth for hundreds of millions to billions of years, depending on just how fundamental we're getting. So where would this common ancestor be fitting in at?



As a mild aside we could obviously be talking some version of panspermia billions of years ago, but there are better explanations IRL. Much as chemistry emerges from fundamental physics, and does so the same everywhere in the universe as far as we can tell, similar biologies emerging should be the basic expectation, not a surprise.

(The issue with the above of course is that we’re not actually dealing with RL, we’re dealing with what the writers had in mind and what they took into account. )
