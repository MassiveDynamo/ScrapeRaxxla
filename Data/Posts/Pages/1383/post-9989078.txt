Brookes: "That's true, but I think you have to make some of it a tiny bit obvious just so people know what they're doing. There's nothing to be revealed at this stage.".

this part has more value at this time than it did back then to me at least.

There's nothing to be revealed at this stage

I would not have guessed the path to certain things was not available at all times, such as Raxxla.
mostly thinking the statement had more to do with their intended path over the years, not realizing all of what that might be. As well as why it was said here.

available for anyone to find
many times

but no mention of when is only occurring to me now.

the first sentence in his quote should be clear but can be read a few ways, not as important to asking when can a person find Raxxla
but I also get asking where is similar to asking when, so not sporting to ask.

I have to remember that even though many of us say there is no end game, there most likely is one for fdev, besides the usual reasons expected.
