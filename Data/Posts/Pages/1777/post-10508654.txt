Ah yes, you could get that info displayed in the early days, and nobody (I think) has ever explained how a barren rock could be a democracy (implying a population), but I suspect there is an FD problem in defining the total system population with no logical relationship to the station populations. But you could have a lead there. Good luck!
Jorki - I just noticed another of your posts where you say you have visited both the comets in Pareco (https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-9903452) - are you able to tell me how to do this? (or even show me in-game?)
