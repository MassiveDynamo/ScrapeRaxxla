Well, I've been quizzed on my data and my experience; but does anyone have any thoughts on how I could conceivably trigger the next step now that I am "considered to be elite" ? The TDW page say you get a subtle test and they reveal themselves but could there be some other condition that I've missed? For what its worth, I also went and got allied to the TDW faction in Shin, but I don't know if that helped or hindered.

I’d recommend raising this as a bug with FD Support, but give them a very factual account of what happened, don’t talk about Raxxla; just the facts, when and where etc but then challenge them and state you had the message about receiving an award eg namely being given the reward of elite, but this had not transpired in actuality and ask why this hasn’t occurred.

Eg ask for your prize!

They likely may ask for proof.

Personally I’d speculate this is a remnant bug of some historical mission or narrative. But only FD can confirm that. If it’s accurate then your Cmdr account ought to reflect this and FD can see that, if it’s not transferred then it’s a broken system and they need to fix it, or at least amend you’re Cmdr account so you have to correct award.
