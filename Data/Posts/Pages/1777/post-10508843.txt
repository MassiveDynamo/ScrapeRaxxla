And the TDW faction was supposed to be locked to the Shinrartza system, but a bug caused it to expand outside of it, which FDev never bothered to fix.
Do you have a source for that? The expansion took place during an unusual and hard-to-repeat set of circumstances, and there have been times where the BGS rules would have made it considerably harder or easier, but it wasn't so far as I can tell caused by a bug in its own right.

The rough timeline is:

- Shinrarta starts off with two factions: Pilots' Federation and Dark Wheel with the former controlling the system; the system is BGS locked from the start with a "capital" lock (as on Sol, Achenar and Alioth, and later extended to a few other places): you can't expand into the system, you can't start asset conflicts within the system, all other BGS actions and states have their normal effects. Notably, expansions out of a "capital lock" system are allowed and work entirely normally.
- the early BGS expansion mechanism had a "swap" effect on it, so early expansions by the Pilots' Federation drag in the LTT 4847 Industry, Future of Arro Naga and Los Chupacabras factions, bringing Shinrarta up to five factions
- at some point around the Horizons release, Frontier decide that the BGS expansion mechanism should work slightly differently and stop it swapping like that, so no further factions get dragged into SD that way
- for the C&P reforms in 3.0, the Pilots' Federation gets converted to a "virtual" faction which no longer holds in-system influence, and is given control of a few extra stations in the (then) starter systems LHS 3447, Eravate and Asellus Primus. This also converts it to a non-influence faction in Shinrarta Dezhra and the nearby systems it had expanded to (you can see the residual impact of this in its control of some minor stations in LFT 926 and other systems near Shinrarta)
- this conversion - by making the controlling faction of Shinrarta a non-influence one - frees up a lot more residual influence in SD itself. Prior to this point, so much of the influence was controlled by the PF that the Dark Wheel would never have hit the expansion threshold. It goes up and down a bit, but never quite hits 75%.
- in the 3.3 release there's a substantial rewrite of how BGS states work and how influence is allocated, which allows TDW to hit 75% influence, and it therefore expands out of Shinrarta just as the PF had before
- in the months following the 3.3 release there are some further adjustments to how BGS influence is allocated, and as a result of that, combined with Shinrarta's extremely high traffic levels, TDW never again gets close to the 75% threshold. But there's no reason to believe that they wouldn't expand if they did that again, it'd just take an unfeasibly large amount of effort to do it against the thousands of other players whose actions push the influence levels in a different direction.
- the "Turning the Wheel" project picks up the expanded TDW faction (which has happened not to retreat again) about 18 months after its initial expansion out of Shinrarta, and starts expanding it further, with no particular effect.

If it was important that TDW never expanded outside the system, then Frontier would probably have done something about it a lot sooner when the PF were expanding, rather than waiting the four years before TDW got a chance, and secondly would have fixed it when it occurred.
