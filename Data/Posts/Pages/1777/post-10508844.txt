At best, the invite you receive from TDW is the permit you get to Shinrartza when you reach Elite rank. Which would make sense since there's at least 2 bodies where the hidden TDW station could be, but FDev never bothered actually implementing such thing ingame.
I totally agree. I'm 99% sure this is currently the engdame of the "Let's join the Dark wheel" portion of the game.

There's literally a lore beacon mentioning the Dark Wheel around the 8th moon of a gas giant in Shinrarta, almost like it's the placeholder for a Dark Wheel station.

I don't think it's a case of "never bothered to.." I think it's just there's nothing else to meaningfully add - what could Fdev add that would contribute to anyone's game any more than Jameson Memorial handing out DW missions and selling all the ships cheap?

If they want to expand on the Dark Wheel, the groundwork is there for the future!
