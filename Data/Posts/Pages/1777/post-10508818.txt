Well, I've been quizzed on my data and my experience; but does anyone have any thoughts on how I could conceivably trigger the next step now that I am "considered to be elite" ? The TDW page say you get a subtle test and they reveal themselves but could there be some other condition that I've missed? For what its worth, I also went and got allied to the TDW faction in Shin, but I don't know if that helped or hindered.
I'm triple Elite and got allied to every single faction I could think of, never received any "invitations". There's dozens or hundreds of commanders who done the same or even more. There is, at this time, no way to trigger any invitations to TDW ingame. Wether FDev ever intended to add such a thing to the game or it was just a fluff article on the Codex we might never know unfortunately.

I was hoping Odyssey would bring some changes to this, perhaps FDev was waiting on space legs for us to be allowed into the TDW hidden station and walk around it. Unfortunately no.
