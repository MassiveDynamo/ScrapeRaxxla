There's also the question of The Dark Wheel ingame faction, which was supposed to mean something as well and even had some cryptic missions being given out at some point, but never went anywhere. And the TDW faction was supposed to be locked to the Shinrartza system, but a bug caused it to expand outside of it, which FDev never bothered to fix. Whatever plans FDev had for this faction, they seem to have completely forgotten about it, or just don't care anymore.
It wasnt a bug, there was a powerplay scheme initiated by a group of players to move TDW faction out of Shinrarta. I think the idea was to move them into Tau Ceti or Sol etc and see if that triggered anything for Raxxla. The initiative should be searchable on the forum...

Ah. Ian's ninja'd me! It was indeed "Turning the Wheel"
