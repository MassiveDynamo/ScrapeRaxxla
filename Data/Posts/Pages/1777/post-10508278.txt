1: What do you mean by 'inbox "covert" mission'?
Yes, a tip-off mission.

2: What do you mean by 'data that "we are not alone in the galaxy"'?
The payload i stole from Blackman, the data said that we are not alone in the galaxy. It was a data packet I read from a node after killing a vast number of turrets and skimmers. I think there were six nodes to data scan

3: What do you mean by 'on-screen message telling me that I am now considered "elite"'?
It came up in a grey text overlay over the centre of the visible screen, and said that i was now considered elite. HOWEVER - it didnt change my actual rating at all. (eg, I'm still only master in combat
Louis Calvert said:
Specifically, do you have screenshots of these things? Or the exact wording at all?
Yeah, I'm really wishing I'd taken screenshots too, but I wasn't planning on sharing this. I'll just have to try to trigger the mission again and record it this time. I guess everyone else is now also able to duplicate what i've done so far, too.
