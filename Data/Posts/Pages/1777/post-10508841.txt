Well, I've been quizzed on my data and my experience; but does anyone have any thoughts on how I could conceivably trigger the next step now that I am "considered to be elite" ? The TDW page say you get a subtle test and they reveal themselves but could there be some other condition that I've missed? For what its worth, I also went and got allied to the TDW faction in Shin, but I don't know if that helped or hindered.
I think what you found, if anything, was a bug. But I am very interested in seeing if you can repeat it and take a screenshot this time, the fact you've done it three times gives me hope you'll do it again and screenshot it so we can all see it. I've not heard about that text appearing before, and the phrasing of it is extremely strange. I've personally done thousands of missions all over the bubble, maybe more, as have many or most of the people on this thread- in fact Marcros started it by reporting on the missions he was doing... , so what you've reported is extraordinary.

As for the rest: your entire theory revolves around Yuri Grom being present in a system with a comet. I've already asked you about those things (which you didn't reply to) and others have pointed out that comets are a historical data artefact too. So I personally don't think there's anything there to consider further at this time.
