Well, I've been quizzed on my data and my experience; but does anyone have any thoughts on how I could conceivably trigger the next step now that I am "considered to be elite" ? The TDW page say you get a subtle test and they reveal themselves but could there be some other condition that I've missed? For what its worth, I also went and got allied to the TDW faction in Shin, but I don't know if that helped or hindered.
