Where are you getting the station population numbers from? EDSM only showing me the total system population
Remember I said someone had actually succeeded in dropping in to the comet instance just outside Asire ... i found the link again https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threa...ormal-space-close-to-them.350586/post-5486213 and it shows a colony at the comet the total Pareco population is huge for six stations - 2.13 billion - but an orbis starport typically only has a small population (so says the wiki) and as an example see https://inara.cz/elite/starsystem/44815/ - the single orbis has a population of only 1 million.
