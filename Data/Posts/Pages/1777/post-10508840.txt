At best, the invite you receive from TDW is the permit you get to Shinrartza when you reach Elite rank. Which would make sense since there's at least 2 bodies where the hidden TDW station could be, but FDev never bothered actually implementing such thing ingame.

I suspect there’s been a great deal of hyperbole presented concerning many of these concepts since launch, I’d speculate various elements were probably never implemented.

Example: pre launch David Braben was asked could we visit the centre of the galaxy - he essentially said why would you want to go there, there’s nothing there, but he then altered it to “it’s already in game” (when it wasn’t) - you can go there “it’s in the galaxy map”.

Same goes I suspect when FD talked about secret groups and invites etc… hyperbole, they were just talking about permits.

We the audience were promoted something totally different pre launch, so I suspect there’s been a lot of audience projection.
