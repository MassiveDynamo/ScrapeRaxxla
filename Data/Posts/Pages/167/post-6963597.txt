They permit locked the whole Cone sector with the new patch, save - apparently - one system...the one into which the Gnosis is going to jump.

This CMDR is beginning to believe that FDev really do hate explorers. The event began as an opportunity to explore a relatively untouched area of currently inaccessible space. Now, all of the possible exploration that could have occured has been taken away, oh, and there be Thargoids. So it's now a four week pew pew stopover.

Beginning to regret going.

Nope, the one that the Gnosis is jumping into is locked as well, see my post higher up the page!

It's that system that the PF have specifically cited as having high levels of Thargoid hydra activity.

I'm not sure I follow your sentiment here tbh - there's plenty of relatively unexplored areas of space. For me, jumping into the Cone is very much about the Permit Lock arrangements and discovering possible reasons around it.

And it's still that way for me - that until now the PF has locked the areas around the Cone but not the Cone itself smacks of something unusual going on.

And now what do we see now that it's going to be possible for a jump in there? The PF not only lock the target system, but they issue a warning using the highest threat currently known to humanity - Thargoid Hydras.

It's a simple tactic - if we can't actually stop it, we'll put people off through scare tactics.

And if it's not scare tactics? Well how do the PF know there's high concentrations of Hydras there? And why has the knowledge been kept from them until the PFs hand has been forced?

What's exploration if not discovering things?

Edit - btw, word on the street is that not every system in Cone is locked. I can't attest to the veracity of that info as it stands, however.
