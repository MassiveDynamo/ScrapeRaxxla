Yeah, already saw that in this thread, but till now nobody posted a trusty link. So, for myself, no, FDevs never said Raxxla system has been honked.

All aboard the good ship cannon express for a one way ticket to raxxla !

The personnal journey to Raxxla trails just to the Gnosis docking yard. Then it becomes a package journey. " Dear Passengers, please pay attention to the crew for a safety demonstration" [haha]
Are we allowed to bring the children ? Pets ? Our own booze ? Aunt Juliet asks if there will be some of these so handsome Native Guides at disposal ? All inclusive ? Dr Arcanonn, may I call you Cpt Cook ?

However if my hypothesis is correct and there is a station named something like “Raxxla Gateway” then it could be the source of a permit unlock mission to open up an area...

"Jameson Memorial " was, to some extent, the first candidate. But since the E/F missions diasappeared...
If there was another system open to Elite Cmdrs only... could be it.
