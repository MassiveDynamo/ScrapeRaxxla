Yeah, already saw that in this thread, but till now nobody posted a trusty link. So, for myself, no, FDevs never said Raxxla system has been honked.



The personnal journey to Raxxla trails just to the Gnosis docking yard. Then it becomes a collective journey. " Dear Passengers, please pay attention to the crew for a safety demonstration" [haha]
Are we allowed to bring the children ?

Only the children of raxxla lol.
And dont forget this liner is in the top 1% of its class
