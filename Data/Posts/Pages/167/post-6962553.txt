Alright, bit of a stretch, since I can't see any other connection, but it's worth a shot to explore... I wonder which stars you checked, because the ones in the 'Key Stone Asterism' are

Pi Herculis, HIP 84380 (reachable, 7 jumps for me)
Zeta Herculis, HIP 81693 (reachable, 1 jump)
Eta Herculis, HIP 81833 (reachable, 2 jumps)
Epsilon Herculis, HIP 83207 (reachable, 3 jumps)

As you can see, they are perfectly within range and reachable. I'll comb them out, but I'm not positive on them.

Apologies - you've made me realise now. I was searching inside the keystone for unusual stars. I think one that sits near the center of them is unreachable.

Here's a more concise link - this one lists some of the stars that are over thousands of light years away:

I don't have access to the game at the moment so feel free to take a look.

Excellent work by the way, a hot cup of tea in a tinfoil cup is in order. Now, where are the biscuits?
