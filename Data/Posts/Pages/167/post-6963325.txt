? What's happened?

They permit locked the whole Cone sector with the new patch, save - apparently - one system...the one into which the Gnosis is going to jump.

This CMDR is beginning to believe that FDev really do hate explorers. The event began as an opportunity to explore a relatively untouched area of currently inaccessible space. Now, all of the possible exploration that could have occured has been taken away, oh, and there be Thargoids. So it's now a four week pew pew stopover.

Beginning to regret going.
