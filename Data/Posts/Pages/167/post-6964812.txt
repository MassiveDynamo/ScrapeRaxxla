Still couldn't help but immediately think of Raxxla when those Guardian Beacons gave a "Ancient Key".

It's interesting.

Using the word 'key' for this thing and calling the Guardian AI 'Constucts', are deliberate choices from FD.

It could be a deliberate hint or a deliberate decoy. We don't know?

Could be one of the most compelling arguments I've seen in a while. Who knows? Perhaps Raxxla is the Guardian's home world?
