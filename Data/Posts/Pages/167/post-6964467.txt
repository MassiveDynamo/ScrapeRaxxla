Well FD have said (if I remember correctly) there are no other galaxies in ED so I discount the original reference, to an extent, as I can’t see how it could fit technically with what FD have done with ED. However if my hypothesis is correct and there is a station named something like “Raxxla Gateway” then it could be the source of a permit unlock mission to open up an area with a third alien race (or the Guardian AI maybe); that would fit both the game mechanics and the essence of the original reference. That station might be orbiting a comet towards the outer rim of a bubble (or nearby) system making it extremely difficult to find.

Fdev have said raxxla has been "honked" !
Also there is now a guardian ai (he insists on being called skippy the magnificent) construct with a collectable "key" hhmmmmm
