FDev themselves told us there is no secret in the federation Station numbers - just eye candy to make them seem more impersonal. They are not even unique - some stations share numbers, because of the way they are calculated from the system ID.
I'd be interested in seeing that calculation or if there is any way to work backwards from station to system. Stations 2296 / 2297 (can't remember which) are the ones that I've been keeping an eye out for.
