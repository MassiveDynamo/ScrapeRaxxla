As I continue to look into to Astrophil and Stella

My previous post has mention that the word eye/eyes is found 83 times in the entire Sonnet. Looking back at the codex part of "as hints for those with eyes to see". I just realize that based on Old English Sonnet for some and not most with the word Eye/eyes, doesn't actually mean that exactly, the translation form for it would be the word See.

As cryptic part of the Raxxla codex may be, it's another twist in that whole line actually means any word with eyes/eye should be see.
