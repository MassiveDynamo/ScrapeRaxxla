Latest tinfoil hattery suggest Redemption derived his super anti-AX weapon from Guardian tech, without fully understanding it.
Firing it somehow activated ancient Guardian AI which would supposedly have infected Thargoïd ships.
That, or the Thargoïds already faced such a weapon back when they were at war with the Guardians and learnt to counter it (and somehow use the power of the attack?)

There's now reports of graffiti in stations near HIP 22460 suggesting Redemption could be somehow linked to Raxxla, and that he could be alive.
Tough in time of despair it could well only be noise instead of signal.. or is it a clue, a link?
Was he onboard The Nemesis near Raxxla when the weapon fired? Did he escaped?
Could it be an indication that Raxxla is somewhere between Sol and HIP 22460?
What's the role of the Children of Raxxla () ? Is there something to see here?

More questions than answers I'm afraid.

According to my research, there’s plenty of evidence to suggest survivors that are hiding somewhere. And also that the AI never went off-line. Some of us have been toying with the idea that there is an entire fleet of constructs out there.
So if The AI was in a dormant state, it could’ve switched back on because it detected another guardian signature somewhere. Or what’s left of the people picked up on it.
You see, some members of the team are theorizing that the Guardian civilization went into hiding, and have been monitoring us through our interactions with the beacons and the sites. This they say would explain the limited number of modules that we find. Like it’s bait to keep us coming back so they can keep studying us. From somewhere else. If that’s the case, you’ve been remotely monitoring humans for a few years now, you know what Tech has been left behind and what to expect from it, when suddenly a massive event takes place that you cannot account for. But it’s obviously your tech that is causing it. your energy signature has been monitored giving off an enormous explosion. Disabling several ships from your former enemy. This obviously would raise eyebrows and they would start accessing the entire system to see what the hell happened. Or what we got our hands on.
Food for thought…
