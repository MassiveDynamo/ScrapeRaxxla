Latest tinfoil hattery suggest Redemption derived his super anti-AX weapon from Guardian tech, without fully understanding it.
Firing it somehow activated ancient Guardian AI which would supposedly have infected Thargoïd ships.
That, or the Thargoïds already faced such a weapon back when they were at war with the Guardians and learnt to counter it (and somehow use the power of the attack?)

There's now reports of graffiti in stations near HIP 22460 suggesting Redemption could be somehow linked to Raxxla, and that he could be alive.
Tough in time of despair it could well only be noise instead of signal.. or is it a clue, a link?
Was he onboard The Nemesis near Raxxla when the weapon fired? Did he escaped?
Could it be an indication that Raxxla is somewhere between Sol and HIP 22460?
What's the role of the Children of Raxxla () ? Is there something to see here?

More questions than answers I'm afraid.

Somebody could’ve used a little common sense. You have a current living enemy attacking you, and you’re going to drudge up million year old tech that’s been lying around where the enemy can find it to use against them. The logic behind that entire move was stupid. Especially considering that we did not have a full understanding of either tech
