Ah, thanks. I hadn’t spotted it before, but then I guess I only very rarely use orrery view! It hadn’t shown in other systems where I’d used it. I’ve removed that point from my theory post:

There's definitely something not right with sol though which is odd given its hand crafted and arguably the one system they would want to get right. I'm left thinking it's working as intended, which does make it strange.

I spent a couple of hours yesterday mooching and honking around the belt zone especially the area where the cluster appears, alas no green. I got bored and went back to trying to get into witch's reach. Oddly there's a couple of systems nearby called haghole and frog, if only I could find puppy dog tails I'd be all set.
