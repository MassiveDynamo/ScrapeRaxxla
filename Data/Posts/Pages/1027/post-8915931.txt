Do any of the 3rd party tools let us search for a list of systems by specific distance from a location, For example a list of every system exactly 235 ly from shinrarta?
Don't think so, you may have to download the systems.csv from https://eddb.io/api and process/extract the info yourself.

Edit: You could try https://eddb.io/system
