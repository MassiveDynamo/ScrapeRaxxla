Just watched the Scott Manley interviews with David Braben from 2015 and have updated the FD quotes thread (https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/fdev-ed-relevant-quotes-videos.553526/#post-8671776) accordingly.

In the part 2 video DB talked about Terraforming technology, the probable shift of power from governments with the Rise of the Corporations, and (most interestingly given my current Raxxla theory) at 13 minutes into the discussion the likely preservation of any signs of alien interest in the Solar System for billions of years, which to me seems clearly to indicate Guardians. He talked specifically about being buried in Martian dust (I.e. the ED “Mars Artefact”), but there was a smile on his face during that part of the conversation. It could have been the beer, or he could have been thinking of Raxxla...
