at 13 minutes into the discussion the likely preservation of any signs of alien interest in the Solar System for billions of years, which to me seems clearly to indicate Guardians. He talked specifically about being buried in Martian dust (I.e. the ED “Mars Artefact”), but there was a smile on his face during that part of the conversation. It could have been the beer, or he could have been thinking of Raxxla...

I didn't get that impression. He mentioned the solar system in general, and in the context of Ceres which had the (at the time) "mysterious" bright spot in the crater. That's not to dismiss the idea of alien artifacts in ED being hidden somewhere in Sol though.
