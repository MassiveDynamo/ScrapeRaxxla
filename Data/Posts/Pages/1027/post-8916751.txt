Just throwing something out there... Are we adament it's in Sol? It just seems odd to me that they would be something clearly so huge and of such importance to the community in such a common, well travelled, well searched area. Look at the lengths FD went to in order to hide The Zurara from the Formidine rift mystery...

Secondly, when there was an interview mentioned earlier and someone from ED said you would need to be Elite to find it... What elite are we talking? Combat or Explorer? I doubt trade Elite woud matter.
