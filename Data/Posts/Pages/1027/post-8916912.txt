Just to update on one point, the segmented representation of the asteroid belt is not unique to sol (I think that's what you mean?). It occurs quite commonly in other systems as well, in the nearby fusang for example.

Ah, thanks. I hadn’t spotted it before, but then I guess I only very rarely use orrery view! It hadn’t shown in other systems where I’d used it. I’ve removed that point from my theory post:
