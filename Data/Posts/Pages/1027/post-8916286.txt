Are they arranged as co-ordinated sets - i.e. at 120 degree intervals? If so then that's a possible stable arrangement. Still spooky though

[Edit]: Isis IX appears (somewhat briefly) in the official novel "Docking is Difficult", which might go some way to explain it's Hand Authored oddness..

Do you remember what happens in the novel at Isis IX? Because there is more oddness in the Isis-system:

none of the system bodies have a "discovered by"-entry
almost all planets have 4(!) "mapped by"-entries. Isis IX has only 1 "mapped by"-entry which is different to the others
the Isis-star is a Class K-star which are usually around 0.6 to 0.9 solar masses; Isis is 0.36 solar masses, thus an unusual K-star
the orbits of the gas giants have a recursive/fractal pattern (I really should provide a screenshot/animation here!); when you look at the Orrery, you'll find the orbit of Isis X resembles the orbit of Isis IX resembles the orbit of Isis VIII a.s.o. The Isis-star is basically at the same focal point for every orbit of the larger planets
the major axis-values for the planets Isis VII to Isis X all have round numbers
the orbital inclination for all planets is divided into three parts, where the inner and outer planets' inclination is identical; you can line the orbits up and you get a nice perfect X for all orbits (again, I shall provide a screenshot here)
Then I have the feeling that the Super Cruise acts different, as if it were on hand brakes; as if there were another invisible mass/system body. I wish we had some telemetry-API since then it would be much easier to measure if the SC-acceleration is different to other systems.
