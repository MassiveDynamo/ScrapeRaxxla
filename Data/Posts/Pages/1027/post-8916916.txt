Just watched this video too...

Well, I have to say I never knew the Thargoids were all female, so I wonder if (or where) there are males of the species?

I also wonder if his comment about AI escaping into deep space has been implemented? Raxxla perhaps? Or Guardian AI?

Parthogenesis? Or perhaps that’s why goids are keen on capturing escape capsules...a fate worse than death!

I think the comment about AI escaping was specifically about human-developed AI, and we can expect it to be hostile when we encounter it. I did wonder if this was implied in one of the abandoned base logs -the one where a body comes back to life. Guardian AI should be out there somewhere; my suspicion is they are behind the Pilot’s Federation (due to the PF use of hexagonal theme akin to Guardian glyphs, see the nav panel for example).
