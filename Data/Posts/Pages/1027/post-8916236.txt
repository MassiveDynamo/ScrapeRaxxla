Do any of the 3rd party tools let us search for a list of systems by specific distance from a location, For example a list of every system exactly 235 ly from shinrarta?

Only one I know of, works off of EDSM, but it works for anything in their database....
But shows ALL systems within the shpere, so youll probably want to copy and past it in to Excel or somthing and sort by distance or w.e. you want

https://www.edsm.net/api-v1/sphere-systems?x=-318.4625&y=-6.9191&z=-283.0745&radius=20

Just replace the X Y Z coordinates with the ones from EDSM for your center system and change the radius (ly) (XYZ is same order on EDSM 123 for coordinates)
