Do any of the 3rd party tools let us search for a list of systems by specific distance from a location, For example a list of every system exactly 235 ly from shinrarta?

EDDB can do it, think Spansh Bodies (https://spansh.co.uk/bodies) can do it, think EDDiscovery/ search panel and EDSM both have mechanisms to do a spherical search.

On second thoughts actually you might get a list of all systems within that radius & have to filter out the nearer ones yourself, & think one of them might be limited to 50 ly radius...itâ€™s been a while!
