Michael Brookes states something about the Mars relic I believe in the old ED Fiction Diary 1 about the 10 min mark:

"There’s the alien artifact that was discovered in the solar system, that’s still a mystery, although hopefully start to reveal a little bit more about where that came from in the future. And of course there’s the Thargoids"

To me, that has always identified the Relic was separate from the Thargoids (likely Guardians) but effectively locked behind a narrative wall.

If the Relic and importantly Sol are or were linked to Raxxla that narrative wall could have already been unlocked (when Guardian content was inserted), or changed (after Guardians were found way too quickly / likely resulting in a lot of narrative either being canned or still in game to be stumbled over) or it is still locked...

Who knows... but my point is MB statement identifies the relic is an important element to the ED narrative (no matter what it is). Its not just lore.

Therefore something is of import within Sol. Now or in the coming narrative...
