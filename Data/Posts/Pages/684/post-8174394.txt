Jameson Ryder, isn't it?

As I understand, the Cobra reference isn't really saying anything other than the fact that you're not going to have to make some 120ly jump to reach it.
So no decked out Anaconda needed. Also the Cobra is THE original ship in the Elite series. I think it's all Jameson would have flew.

No, It's jason.

jameson is known for delivering the deadly virus to the thargoids that ended the war. Unbeknownst to him.

(edit: john jameson being his name) totally different from jason ryder and the ryder family.
