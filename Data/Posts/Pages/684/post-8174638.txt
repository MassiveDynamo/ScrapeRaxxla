So Rhea then instead of Vega? Her grief from Cronus devouring her children? Along with Cronus’ woe once Rhea got her children to overthrow him. The “Skyglow Havens” in the Rhea archipelago have also been mentioned for the disappearances of both Consuela Knight and Olav Redcourt. I’m not trying to link everything. Just scrutinizing articles or places involved with disappearances.
Side note: The Red Court Farm is a book that begins with mentioning a mysterious haunted island that can only be reached periodically due to tides.

Put me in the looney bin.
