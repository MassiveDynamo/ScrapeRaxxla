It's mostly based on the fact that it had to be able to be accessed by old hyperdrives that the game launched with, which were minimal jump range.

Strictly speaking, while DB has stated Raxxla has been in-game from the outset (gamma) I donâ€™t recall any statements from FD that tell us it actually is accessible. We are just working on the assumption/hope that it is. This has been raised several times in this thread- we need someone to grab DB during his next livestream and get his answer to this specific question! If a second question was raised as to whether it is locked behind a permit, that answer would also be really useful!
