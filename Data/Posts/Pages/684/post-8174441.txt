FSSd a system today, found 1 asteroid belt with 0 locations and it auto found another 14 asteroid belts, as usual I didn't check any of them out at all, Ive had systems with binary stars and 2 belts and thats it and ignored them....asteroid belts would be a dman good place to hide it...if it hasnt exploded and turned into one already.
