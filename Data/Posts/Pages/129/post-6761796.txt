I have to say, if FDev have 'hidden' Raxxla in a system with 'RA XX-L A' in the name I'll consider it an even bigger disappointment than the Zurara.

Would you prefer a marker on the galaxy map saying “Ere be Drrrragons!”??

I don't know if it's the case with any of the systems in your list, but there are a few Ax-y named stars that are M types.

In addition, I once found an ELW in orbit around an M type star.

It's not outside the bounds of possibility for Raxxla to meet both criteria.

Why does Raxxla have to be an ELW? Have I missed a clue?
