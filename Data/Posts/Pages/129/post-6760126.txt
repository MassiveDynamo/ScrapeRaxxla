They probably haven't. All the systems are Y or T class stars. Would also be a bit more than a little bit obvious.

I don't know if it's the case with any of the systems in your list, but there are a few Ax-y named stars that are M types.

In addition, I once found an ELW in orbit around an M type star.

It's not outside the bounds of possibility for Raxxla to meet both criteria.
