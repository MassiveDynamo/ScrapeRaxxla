It doesn't - kind of. I used three-letter combinations that brought up results in the list box - so, for example, RAG- brought up several items, then I moved to RAH-, etc. Some combinations brought no results whatsoever.

It takes about two minutes to type 'RA' in the galaxy map search box and click through all the systems. None of them have names that are interesting.

Unless you count Rakka, which has a L-class star in the system.

I have updated my list of 'RA XX-L A' systems, if anyone needs something to visit in the black:
