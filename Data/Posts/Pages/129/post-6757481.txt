Well, I just tried EDSM and typed RA[A-Z] (so RAA, RAB, RAC, ... , RAY, RAZ) in the search box - no matches came up for anything that matched RA??LA. So either it's NOT in EDSM, or there's no such system.

I don't think EDSM allows for partial word searches.

They need to change that btw. They need to add multiple ways to look up partial terms. Specifically mutliple * in one name.

I just noticed something. EDSM states there are 8 celestial bodies in the system. I wonder if the guy saw that and assumed it meant 8 planets and not a star and 7 planets.

It also says Lorrad discovered it... That is either rOmiLaYu's in game name or someone actually beat him to it by a short time.

That system was first discovered for EDSM by lorrad on Oct 31, 2017, 6:42:38 PM.
