I have to say, if FDev have 'hidden' Raxxla in a system with 'RA XX-L A' in the name I'll consider it an even bigger disappointment than the Zurara.

Its all even more disappointing than that even. There will be whole new levels of human disappointment in this thread when the "truth" comes out about Raxxla.

Of course that is the nature of trying to find something that doesn't exist. You can never really prove to them it doesn't exist. They will always just claim that we haven't searched good enough yet. Despite people essentially trampling over every piece of countryside on Earth and there being little left to explore except maybe the bottom of the ocean, People still think Bigfoot exists.

-"Raxxla is missing?!?!?"
-"Working as intended..."
