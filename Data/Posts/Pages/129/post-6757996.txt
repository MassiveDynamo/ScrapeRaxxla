In game and forum handle are the same.

Oh, I just assumed you had an alternate handle or account and discovered it and was off by a few days in discovery or something. Or someone actually beat you and you were still off a tad... I figured someone turned in data quicker or something and got the credit or something odd.

I had an idea. How hard would it be to do a reverse search and document, like EDSM, which systems were checked and in which way while searching for raxxla. You could keep track of what is left to search and do a more concentrated one. It would make it easier to do an exhaustive search of things like the bubble much quicker. Maybe EDSM could do a raxxla search map. It may not require much more than making a map with reverse colors from their current data.
