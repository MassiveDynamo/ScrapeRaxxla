The thing with EDSM is, the person who "first" discovered it for EDSM, is the first person to enter the system with E Market Connector or an equivalent recording program. I have many "first discoveries" on my name, which were already discovered in game.

The same rules apply for a system to be searchable on EDSM, it has to be discovered by someone sharing his data with anything recording journal entries with EDSM.
