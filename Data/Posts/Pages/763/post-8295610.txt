Huh, that's strange. EDSM's info on the system says it requires a permit, I wonder if it was locked at some point?
Eh, random, and wrong. Have you discovered EDDB.io yet? It's a High Security but it wasn't showing as discovered prior to going there which may indicate it was once Low Security and has since improved. It's not showing as locked on any of the older lists I've got but here's a link to what should be locked currently.
