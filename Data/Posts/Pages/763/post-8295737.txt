Yeah this is one of the issues with a mythological approach, it's broadly spread and easy to fudge. I'd love to believe the answer stems solely from The Toast + Astrophel and Stella but there aren't any clearly-defined boundaries to follow.

I'm still certain the answer will be much simpler than anyone expected, probably locked behind a permit zone.

I suspect the "personal journey" we must undertake requires system permits to be gained, etc
