It's a shame there's no solid connection on Wikipedia between the Roman and Greek versions of this story, since it would make a very good potential lead.

Names are changed periodically to protect the guilty and confuse the uninitiated. The planets in the Sol-ar system are currently known by their Roman personas and have direct Greek equivalents, as they do in many other cultures eg the Roman Jupiter, Greek Zeus and Norse Thor.

(Note: Celestial anomalies over long periods such as precessional cycles might imply timing, not places.)
