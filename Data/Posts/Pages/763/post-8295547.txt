Thanks.
There are also some interesting stories in Hindu mythology.
Vishnu is the ‘ruler of the multiverse’. He is a blue four armed chap that has Brahma inside him(AI enhanced Guardian?).
Brahma is then bourn from Vishnus navel, wihile Vishnu is sleaping on a giant cobra, floating in the ocean of milk.
Brahma then becomes the achitect of our universe. All that can be seen and compreheded?

Vishnu even has a jewel so magnificent that no one else can carry it, without being corupted.

There is lots more and way more complex and contraditory than the Greek stuff.
