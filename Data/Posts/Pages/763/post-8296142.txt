Looking at Ross 145. High security but not discovered? Doesn't appear to be permit locked. Checking...

[Edit: Well, the locals don't seem to like me very much but I can confirm there is no system permit lock.]

Huh, that's strange. EDSM's info on the system says it requires a permit, I wonder if it was locked at some point?
HR 4413 is permit locked but im able to 'view' it's system map.

Population allegedly zero, but why lock an empty system with no bodies, not to mention it's right in the bubble and only a jump or 2 from shin dez & lft 926 maybe only 5 from decait. According to galmap pilots fed owns the permit, none have been issued

Edit: a theory on why it's an empty system is because it's permit locked, so no one's been able to discover anything there and share it with universal cartographics. But perhaps somebody, before it was locked, passed through the system and didn't bother honking. or did honk but it was with an old version of the discovery scanner. I know that was just a rumor that has never been confirmed but apparently so is raxxla (lore wise to the general public)
