Just checked out Gliese 1269, since that was Jacques' departure point before he ended up at Colonia. Don't see why he came here- it's unpopulated, which made me suspicioius.
Nothing to report.
As Jacques is an AI it might got aware of the Thargoids returning before we did, so maybe Jacques was trying to get as far away as possible by jumping to the most remote point in the galaxy and ended up in Colonia because the station was UA bombed prior jumping.
