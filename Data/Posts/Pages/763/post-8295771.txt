It was! But I enjoyed the read, however not convinced. I’m not really in favour of the mythological approach, as I’ve said before. The trouble is that the various mythologies (all of them Greek, Roman, etc etc) are full of characters that could fit TDW toast. Doomed lovers, parental grief etc are a common theme. How do we narrow down the choices?

You don't narrow down the choices because its all the same story.

Every now and then you'd see a new spin on an old tale in pop culture.

For example, the latest movie Knives Out. So many motifs placed with seemingly no reason at all (Chekov's gun). Etymologies of characters' names all very interesting, just like NPC names in Galnet etc...
