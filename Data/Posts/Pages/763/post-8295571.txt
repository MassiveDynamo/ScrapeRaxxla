Perhaps more worthy of mention however is that there is a minor faction in Elite called "Zephyr Nation" who's home system is permit locked.
Looking at Ross 145. High security but not discovered? Doesn't appear to be permit locked. Checking...

[Edit: Well, the locals don't seem to like me very much but I can confirm there is no system permit lock.]
