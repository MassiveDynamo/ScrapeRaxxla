It was! But I enjoyed the read, however not convinced. I’m not really in favour of the mythological approach, as I’ve said before. The trouble is that the various mythologies (all of them Greek, Roman, etc etc) are full of characters that could fit TDW toast. Doomed lovers, parental grief etc are a common theme. How do we narrow down the choices?

Yeah this is one of the issues with a mythological approach, it's broadly spread and easy to fudge. I'd love to believe the answer stems solely from The Toast + Astrophel and Stella but there aren't any clearly-defined boundaries to follow.

I'm still certain the answer will be much simpler than anyone expected, probably locked behind a permit zone.
