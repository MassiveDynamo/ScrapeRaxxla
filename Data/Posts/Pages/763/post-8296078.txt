Yes well its up to interpretation but IMO Brabs is simply referencing permit regions, and that whole 'save the princess' stuff is a Star Wars reference, in other words, there isn't a big single player based narrative like lets go save that princess...
I'm more interested in "you'll get invited to join things" and "secret organisations"
But yeah, it's up to interpretation.
