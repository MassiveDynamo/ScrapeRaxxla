a minor point : In the codex the name is Astrophel with an 'e'

I'm curious how you know about MB's favourite book - reference please..

For interest, the wayback machine can show you more about MB's (I believe otherwise unpublished?) book about the Tau Ceti mission and articles about sun-dragons there-in.

The Tau Ceti Mission

the wayback machine is a very useful resource, btw..

Indeed. Though linking “Astrophel and Stella” to the codex entry “the children's story Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars” has always seemed to me to be a bit of a leap of faith.

Though I do remember the phrase used by DB in the vid that was mentioned here recently: ED “does have a story, but it’s not a single-player threaded “rescue the princess” style story, it’s a story of your progression through the game, we will have things that happen to you at certain stages through the game, you’ll get invited to join things, if you get invited to join a secret organisation that’s a thing that can happen to lots of players, if you don’t get that invitation you’ll think to yourself why?”

There is however an “Astrophile” - a series of astronomer’s articles in the magazine New Scientist that I’m sure DB, MB and many at FD would have read. I’ve already mentioned my thoughts and investigations into some of those articles, especially those around the time when ED would have been in the design phase.

“Spiralling stars” is an interesting turn of phrase too; it could refer to a galaxy, stars rotating around a BH, the thargoid machine display, or it could refer to the planets in a solar system- on Earth the planets were “wandering stars” as seen by the ancients and therefore deemed to be gods. This was one of the reasons why I was investigating Sol.
