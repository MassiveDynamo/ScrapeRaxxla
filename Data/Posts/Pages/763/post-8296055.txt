As Jacques is an AI it might got aware of the Thargoids returning before we did, so maybe Jacques was trying to get as far away as possible by jumping to the most remote point in the galaxy and ended up in Colonia because the station was UA bombed prior jumping.

Actually he’s a cyborg, a former Fed black ops soldier captured by the Imps and ‘enhanced’ with cybernetic implants, not an AI.
He was supposedly jumping to Beagle Point, presumably to have a quiet life and only serve the occasional lavian brandy to tired intrepid explorers. But why did he start from Gliese 1269? There’s no population to provide customers, there’s absolutely nothing there of interest that I could find. This in itself may be a clue, but darned if I can fathom it.

edit: however Gliese 1269 is only a short jump away from Elvira Martuk at Khun!?
