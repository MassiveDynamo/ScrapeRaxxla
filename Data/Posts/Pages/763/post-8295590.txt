Looking at Ross 145. High security but not discovered? Doesn't appear to be permit locked. Checking...

[Edit: Well, the locals don't seem to like me very much but I can confirm there is no system permit lock.]

Huh, that's strange. EDSM's info on the system says it requires a permit, I wonder if it was locked at some point?
