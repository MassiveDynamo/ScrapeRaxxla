How many of those can you view the system map for? I posted the system map of a permit locked system in which the permit is an unknown unlock. I only just learned not all of you can view this system' map. Im not suggesting this is the one. But it shouldn't be so easily shrugged off either.

Oh, I’m not shrugging it off! It was more that your post led to me having a breakfasttime ramble- it often happens when the caffeine kicks in, augmented by a Sunday morning treat of a pain au chocolate while listening to the storm raging outside!

But I suspect that the HR 4413 lock was only applied after someone went through & discovered it, so the data was uploaded to galmap so it became visible. I suspect this also happened for Witch’s Reach since the system map data is available online, though I don’t think I can see it myself in-game (possibly uploaded to EDSM but the commander was destroyed before selling to UC?). FD seem to have departed from, or implemented their original plans late by adding permit locks after game release. Many people visited Col70/Cone Sector etc before that area was locked.

edit: just checked- I cant see the system map for HR 4413, nor for Witch's Reach. Maybe because you;re on console & I'm on PC?
