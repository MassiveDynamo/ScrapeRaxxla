Not quite sure at face value what that means, but if it means that we're supposed to think literally and scientifically, do a quick check at how good that has served this thread and get back to me.
You criticised peopleâ€™s abilities to understand a metaphor, and said most of the world is blind (metaphorically speaking). So I made a joke, referencing an old saying by Erasmus, about how the value of any ability depends on its commonness.

I was not trying to suggest a way to approach the search for Raxxla, nor was I attempting to say that a one eyed man would rule over blind people due to having some kind of advantage. It was just a light hearted attempt at humour.

Obviously what I said was taken literally, which is kind of ironic considering the post I was responding to, but probably my fault for poor delivery. Sorry if I confused, misled and/or offended anyone.
