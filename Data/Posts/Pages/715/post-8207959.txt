'In the Kingdom of the blind, the one-eyed man is King'

Its a quote/saying. Think that's what BluWolve was referring to, as a joke

Edit: Its nearly 2020 and I cant let it lie. The one eyed man would be the one without the advantage in that kingdom, he would be the one having all the trouble. Nothing would be labelled or coloured to say what it is for example, he would have no advantage really. He would be a hindrance as his movements are based on sight where everyone else is based on other senses and relying on others to do the same. Ever seen a footlball match played by bind people? Sighted people get in the way sometimes. And yes I do have a bee in my bonnet about human equality in general. Hence the Alliance leanings!
