Not that it amounts to much or really says much of anything (they can’t) but I had asked about if Raxxla was currently discoverable, if TDW as described in the Codex exists and is discoverable, if exotic stars and rogue planets exist in game.
the response I got from FDEV was that “they cannot advise on things not yet discovered by players”. Which is understandable. To me and my tinfoil its an interesting choice of words but thats also reading into it what isn’t explicitly there as well.
