The video is in a comment a page or so back.
What I find interesting is that a few weeks ago (mas o menos) Drew Wagar was on this thread (I think it was this thread) saying how he does not believe that Raxxla will be found until FDev decide to leak its location as an end of game event with no extra narrative. Then a few days later on his Facebook page he mentioned having a sit down with FDev. Be nice to have some real narrative i the game, even if it isn't Raxxla.
