I was referring more to the point of removing active ones unnecessarily. Scientist also aren't important enough for that(Although they have certainly put themselves in that position.). They don't need to actively use it as much as others they should not be making the decisions. Maybe get poeple from all areas like ship captains and other things that use stuff more intensely. You can easily loose something someone might not realize the importance of. And standardization is not as good as it is cracked up to be. It can actually cause alot of problems. Especially for long term issues and things related to maintaining knowledge over the long run. One reason a , "scientist," should not be editing list of things used in practical fields.

I still don't think you quite get it. All the old constellations are still there. We Rifters should know from our travels to Camelopardalis ... a constellation that didn't make the cut for the 88. Just because astronomers reduced the number they use doesn't mean that other disciplines are required to follow suit. Cassiopeia is still the giraffes to many people in Africa.
