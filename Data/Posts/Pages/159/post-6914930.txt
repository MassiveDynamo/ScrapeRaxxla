So, it's been a long time since I've reported back on this search for Raxxla. I have found a similar 'thing' to it...

"Yog-Sothoth knows the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the key and guardian of the gate. Past, Present, and future is all-in-one in Yog-Sothoth. He knows where the Old Ones broke through of old, and where They shall break through again. He knows where They have trod through earth's fields, and where They still tread them, and why no one can behold Them as They tread."
-H.P. Lovecraft, 'The Dunwich Horror'

Copied from the Wiki.





















Would fit MBâ€™s penchant for Lovecraft
so has anybody searched the galmap for Yog Sothoth Yuggoth Dunwich......

Vaporous brains of the spiral nebulae might be the brain trees.....
