I still don't think you quite get it. All the old constellations are still there. We Rifters should know from our travels to Camelopardalis ... a constellation that didn't make the cut for the 88. Just because astronomers reduced the number they use doesn't mean that other disciplines are required to follow suit. Cassiopeia is still the giraffes to many people in Africa.

Vain queens and giraffes... Brings back happy memories, even though it was pretty much solved before I could even get my head around it!
