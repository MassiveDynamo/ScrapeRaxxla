Personally I blame prohibition. :O

They should prohibit prohibition... Besides, in a 'free' society, prohibition should be illegal. And yet we live in a 'free' society! We're all freeeeeeee!

On a brighter note, I saw some poster post back a few hours/pages ago that they think they might be on to something. Any news?
