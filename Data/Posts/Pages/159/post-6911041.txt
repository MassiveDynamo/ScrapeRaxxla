Why would they bother renaming constellations?! Do they lack lives. I get tired of organization changing things like this. I guarantee you they don't fully know the reason behind why they were chosen originally. Even if they are in the field appropriate for it. People in certain areas are way too arrogant.

It was the fashion in the swinging 20s. Short hair, short dresses and short constellation lists. Becase of the great depression in 29, they could not afford to bring the long list back.
