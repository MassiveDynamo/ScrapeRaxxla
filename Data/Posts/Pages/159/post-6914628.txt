So, it's been a long time since I've reported back on this search for Raxxla. I have found a similar 'thing' to it...

"Yog-Sothoth knows the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the key and guardian of the gate. Past, Present, and future is all-in-one in Yog-Sothoth. He knows where the Old Ones broke through of old, and where They shall break through again. He knows where They have trod through earth's fields, and where They still tread them, and why no one can behold Them as They tread."
-H.P. Lovecraft, 'The Dunwich Horror'

Copied from the Wiki.

Considering what we know about Elite, cosmic horrors are not beyond what we should expect. Food for thought, anyway.

en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yog-Sothoth (visit this)


The idea of creatures that live solely in space feeding off gasses and energy is not a new trope. Cosmozoans as Star Trek puts them aren't too much of a far fetched idea given what we've seen of these 'Thargoids'.

Also, this planet from the same mythos is of interest.

With the dawning of the Far God cult and the possible extra-dimensional nature of Thargoids being tossed around GalNet being a thing; I decided to broaden my line of thinking regarding Raxxla.
