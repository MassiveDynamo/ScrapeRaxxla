They were probably broke from spending too much money on those short hair styles and short dresses.. If you put a million shiny beads on the dress no amount of short can make it cheaper. Those 20's dresses do not look cheap. At least not from a modern standpoint. Maybe those things were less expensive then.

Those weren't shiny beads. That was stars that they mercilessly ripped out of the old constellations.

Personally I blame prohibition. :O
