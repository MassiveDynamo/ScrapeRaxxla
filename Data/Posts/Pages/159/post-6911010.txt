Why would they bother renaming constellations?! Do they lack lives. I get tired of organization changing things like this. I guarantee you they don't fully know the reason behind why they were chosen originally. Even if they are in the field appropriate for it. People in certain areas are way too arrogant.

It really wasn't a 'renaming' of the constellations. It was a matter of choosing which constellations to use for astronomical purposes. Almost every culture and civilization looked into the night sky and matched the patterns in the sky with things from their own culture, mythology and folklore. Thousands of competing constellation names where the constellations overlap each other can be very messy. Reducing the number of constellations to just 88 distinct constellations that don't overlap each other was a necessity to standardizing astronomical observation for scientists.

Rest assured that all the stars are still where they were and you can still point your finger toward the Big Dipper even if those nasty astronomers insist that it is actually Ursa Major
