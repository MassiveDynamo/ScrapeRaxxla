The next 'asteroid' belt is the Kuiper Belt. The Oort cloud is only small comet sized bodies and much further out. Many of the larger Kuiper belt objects are already in game.

While my interpretation of the clues led me to concentrate on the main asteroid belt, and there does seem to be something significant there, asteroid belts around Saturn, Jupiter and Uranus might be profitable-still unsure about that TDW stealthed station! Was never fully convinced by Lyta Cranes “around 8th moon”, but it could be at one of those GG.
