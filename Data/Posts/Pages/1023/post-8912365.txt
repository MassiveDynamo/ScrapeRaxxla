Han_Zen has pointed out to me the “Obfuscated on the Outer Rim” mission that seemed to indicate Raxxla & used to be available in Shin Dezhra (see first post of this thread). It is one of the clues we have been given (yes, of course there are clues!).

I forgot to point out in my latest hypothesis (well, should call it a theory since I believe I found supporting evidence) https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-8911441
that the green glow I encountered was found while I was near the outer rim of the asteroid belt!

Mmm, maybe I should tweak FD and report it as a bug?
