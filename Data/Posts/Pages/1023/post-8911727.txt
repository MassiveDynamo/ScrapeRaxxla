The existence of hex edit in the game's lore means fdev has full liberty to pretend like any story from any character is potentially fabricated. That's even without considering lying.

Such a lazy way to deal with having to retcon your narrative because everyone isn't on the same page or the company decides to not follow thru with implementing the narrative as they've constructed.
