There are 33 dashes in the icon. Interestingly the symbol for the 33rd asteroid does not involve 3/6 crossed lines! Asteroid 33 (they are numbered in historical order of discovery, not size or semi-major axis distance) is named “33 Polyhymnia” (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/33_Polyhymnia) with orbital period of 1,773.541 days (semi-major axis =2.86745 AU= 1431 ls). Sol’s main asteroid belt is shown in the sysmap (the only example to date to be so depicted in-game, which itself seems significant) as an annulus (IRL it’s actually a torus) divided into 32 sectors.

Just an idea with the 33 part and you saying the main belt is divided into 32 part. Now sol has two main asteroid belts in real life. The one your searching and the oort cloud. Now you say that the belts aren't shown and you have to find them. Could there be a hidden cluster out in the region of where the oort cloud should be making that the 33. Maybe follow the line of transit of the voyagers as they may have stumbled upon it. And I dont mean make a beeline for them from the centre of the system. Follow the 'true' arc they would have followed. Just an idea thats all.
