If you are right then I shall be quite miffed, having spent already considerable resources trying to find stuff in Sol's asteroid belt. I imagine there are a few others too. But I find it hard to fault your logic.


My only small quibblett is that re: TDW Station, that Lyta says it's and unnamed gas giant with 8 moons. All Sol's have names (not to mention fewer than 8 moons) - OK so maybe she is lying/ was lied to...
