I take that to mean she wasn’t told/doesn’t know the name of the system or gas giant.
Doesn’t mean it couldn’t be Jupiter, Saturn or Uranus!!
Especially if she’s lying/spinning out what she knows/suspects which the phrasing of Codex also allows.

I know DW said don’t believe everything said in ED; did DB say it too?

But at present I’m suspicious about the very existence of TDW station, as I said it could be just a flag that Raxxla/Omphalos is stealthed.
