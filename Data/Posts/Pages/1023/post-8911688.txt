I got the Sol permit yesterday. It was the long long journey for me due old roleplay limitations. But nevermind! I'm ready to explore this home of the humanity now. But I think I'm bad Raxxla seeker. I still can't to fight and shoot in this game. Don't see the reason of it. I just don't want to rise up the combat ramking (I'm double Elite with 0% in combat). Anyway I agree with Jorki in his (Sol) theory. The Sol is the jewel and good start point of Raxxla hunting.
