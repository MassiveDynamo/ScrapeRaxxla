though I can't guarantee that this is not a breach of copyright... the copy I have didn't in fact come from FD link, btw - bad memory!

[edit:] I should add that there is 0 mention of Raxxla and the DW in this manual - partly as it would have been written before the novella was complete.
That... looks... familiar... I could have sworn the welcome to the manual message was at the start of the combat section, not the beginning of the book, but I could be wrong (craft moment). Thought I saw it said somewhere that Robert wrote the manual as well, unsure which came first but I agree Raxxla ain't in it.
