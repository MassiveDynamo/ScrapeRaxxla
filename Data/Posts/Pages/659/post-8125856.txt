why would you look for clues for raxxla. they literally have said there would be no clues, no narrative to direct you and no hints as to where raxxla is in the ED galaxy.

In all likelihood it is a non-descript planet that looks like any of the other millions you've traveled across, not named anything special but if you happen to get really close to it and happen to fly over some part of it you will see something that lets you know this is probably raxxla.

It could have already been discovered and just wasn't gone over with a fine toothed comb ...or it could be in some system far ....far away from the jump in point and remain invisible to the system screen until you get within 1000ls of it, but finding it among the background of stars would almost require you to already know exactly where to look to find it.
