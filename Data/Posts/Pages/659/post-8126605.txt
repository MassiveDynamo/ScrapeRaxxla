So, what happened to the legend of Raxxla post 2296? It spread like wildfire throughout backwater space bars and in hushed tones across boardroom tables. Good luck mapping that mess!

So in 2280 the pre Birthright Wars Federation higher ups knew about the Mars Artifact. What if I track the individual corporate splits? Possibly a corporation that went/stayed Independent had knowledge of the relic. The trail starts in 2900.

P.S. Now that I've re read this post only one Corporation comes to mind. Sirius! It's a stretch to think the Feds pre 2900 shared info between corporations mind you...

Now that the history of the myth's origins have been opened up, any thoughts? Scytale, Han, Jorki, Macros?
