@Six6VI - I played all original versions of Elite, read everything to do with it and watched anything on TV that mentioned it and now they are all blended in into one story in my head and that was 30 years ago nearly so cant say for sure where or when a particular thing came to light, sorry, cant be any more help.

And the 1984 manual online? I found a colour one online that said it was original so wonder if I found the right one. (original had the wire frame ships in the manual Im pretty sure not the later coloured filled in ones that were on the website I found - happy to recant if anyone finds an original manual and can photo it with coloured ships in) Ive got the games still but none of the manuals. It may have been in later versions or an advert for a future game, it could have been anywhere to be honest.
Sounds like a nasty case of the CRAFT (Can't Remember A Freakin Thing) ... (Or space madness o7)

Speaking from experience cough BBC B cough the specifics escape me too. Pretty sure the manual I had was greyscale with shaded ships and we may have read the same one online? As far as up to the day or so (+/- sleep I presume?) information on the current wild goose chase, the OP in this thread is it!
