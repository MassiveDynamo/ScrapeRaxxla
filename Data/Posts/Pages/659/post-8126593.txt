Ah! I'm glad you showed up, I want a refund on this DSS probe radius upgrade you did last week!

Ahh, if only we could sort the nav beacon codex by alpha or numeric so it's a bit easier to see what you already have and which ones are still missing. Keep an eye on Galnet for stories about famous explorers offering PAX missions with temporary sector permits to grant access to currently locked areas... I wish...
"I dunno, your probe launcher looks like it works." launches probe at your ship "No refunds." said ships' left landing gear collapses

Nothing else of note really happens between 2200 and 2296. I'm willing to bet the classified nonhuman artifact plays into how the Raxxla legend began. It's not hard to think that a nonhuman classified artifact spawned the legend of Raxxla as a byproduct of wild speculation. However, the fact the artifact is to this day still classified over 1100 years later is of note.
