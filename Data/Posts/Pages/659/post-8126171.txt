Ian bell has the manual in text form. I have a copy from FD of the original - am looking for the link it came from - please bear with.

not heard direct evidence for ret-conning of the official novels, but Drew did point out some changes to hyperspace lore. AFAIK we have to assume that official novels are canon.

The'84 novella should probably be treated as a story or myth in the ED context, only true in flavour.

though I can't guarantee that this is not a breach of copyright... the copy I have didn't in fact come from FD link, btw - bad memory!

[edit:] I should add that there is 0 mention of Raxxla and the DW in this manual - partly as it would have been written before the novella was complete.
