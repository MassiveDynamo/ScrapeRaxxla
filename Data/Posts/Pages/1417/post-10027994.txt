He was travelling to Beagle Point, but pulled out of hyperspace and off course. Some of the quotes attributed to him also match up with Halsey's accounts.

I'm not at my PC right now to look up the articles easily, but I thought I'd at least mention it.
A while back I tried to find the quote where Jaques is talking about the UA's "singing", I remember that quote and have seen others quote it, do you remember that too? I can't find the actual quote in the Galnet archives, any ideas? Is it a Mandela effect?

I want to find something that give us a strong link to the third paragraph in the toast - or perhaps that third paragraph actually needs decoding (aka 'the runes' method in one of the treasurehunts).
Maybe the Formidine Rift expedition logs needs another look? If they contain one thing that's a fairly decent match, maybe there's more? I was mostly only looking for the "whisperer" bit as I remembered that from ages ago. I'll have a look, see if anything jumps out, if you like?
