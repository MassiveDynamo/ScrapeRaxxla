A while back I tried to find the quote where Jaques is talking about the UA's "singing", I remember that quote and have seen others quote it, do you remember that too? I can't find the actual quote in the Galnet archives, any ideas? Is it a Mandela effect?

Maybe the Formidine Rift expedition logs needs another look? If they contain one thing that's a fairly decent match, maybe there's more? I was mostly only looking for the "whisperer" bit as I remembered that from ages ago. I'll have a look, see if anything jumps out, if you like?
UAs are singing, Jacques had a Witchspace incident indeed. It suits the second pragraph.
But there's no link to the first paragraph (the first broad clue: treasurehunt model) in the toast that I can see, perhaps my mind is too cluttered atm.

A bit of the same problem occurs to me with the Formidine Rift narrative if I stick to the Toast (being the treasure-hunter glue). I need to understand what in the first paragraph that points us to the Formidine narrative.

Sorry if I missed your posts on this in the past, there not enough room in my mind anymore
