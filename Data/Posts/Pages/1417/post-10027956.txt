You might also want to look up earlier Jaques articles in relation to this too. Colonia only started because of Jaques eventual location, but he wasn't intending to be there. He was travelling to Beagle Point, but pulled out of hyperspace and off course. Some of the quotes attributed to him also match up with Halsey's accounts.

I'm not at my PC right now to look up the articles easily, but I thought I'd at least mention it.
Thanks, I recall that debacle. I just didn't find the 'broad general link' in their story-telling model for it yet, the broad link to a relevant clue in other game/media. (Yet).

I agree, I have been going over all the Halsey stuff for a while (I did an article on the whole thing years ago, I've always loved Halsey's story), I've been investigating a lot of hyperspace-realted stuff trying to look for anything related to her mis-jump (that's how I ended up with Witchspace Plants and trying to go through weird stuff like that).

Here's my post collecting all the "whispers" or related to Sirens/sounds that lure people etc.

I have said it many times, but this part I think is the most compelling:


That's the closest thing I've ever found in-game to that part of the Toast all as one complete thing.
The structure is just so similar:

"to the whisperer in witch-space, the siren of the deepest void!" - Codex
"weird voices in the last jump, they’re calling to me… a siren song". - Formidine Rift

Any good to you?

Yeah, I read that at the time. It's definitively a thing that is backed up with their way of telling stories.
I think it shares the same strong links, but I'm clueless how to continue tracing that one as well.

I want to find something that give us a strong link to the third paragraph in the toast - or perhaps that third paragraph actually needs decoding (aka 'the runes' method in one of the treasurehunts).
