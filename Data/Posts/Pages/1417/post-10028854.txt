Ok, further thought over my Cornish pasty & coffee....I thought Duartu Jet Comms PLC might be a lead, but according to EDSM/minor factions they dont exist. Does it point to Daurtu system?

And moreover, if we are ignoring MB & DB utterances on Raxxla then we dont know there is a Raxxla narrative-we only have a throwaway line from MB saying they thought should be a storyline in-game. And DB has only said it is in game.
