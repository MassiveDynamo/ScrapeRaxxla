Thans for the heads up on the faction, I found this:
Minor Faction Daurtu Jet Comms PLC - EDDB
Minor Faction Daurtu Jet Comms PLC in Elite: Dangerous
eddb.io

And re BnB, we know what we know - but I (personally) choose to avoid using it as part of the factors to explain a evidence/fact/link or relation.
It's nice to know, but plans may have changed since 2014/2015 - except we have to assume Raxxle is in game, and that we can access it somehow. Otherwise this journey is pointless.
Reactions:
Rochester and Jorki Rasalas
