Thargoid maelstrom update; I’ve edited my previous ramblings regarding these. Previously I made some speculation about celestial spheres etc… totally nonsense of course (!) at least in relation to these maelstroms.

The additional 2 points do not correlate with my earlier projections as they seem to be dispersed in both hemispheres; granted none of them are intruding inside this sphere of influence… but there is not enough data to draw any conclusions, other for me to edit my speculation.
