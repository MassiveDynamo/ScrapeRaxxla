A while back I tried to find the quote where Jaques is talking about the UA's "singing", I remember that quote and have seen others quote it, do you remember that too? I can't find the actual quote in the Galnet archives, any ideas? Is it a Mandela effect?


Maybe the Formidine Rift expedition logs needs another look? If they contain one thing that's a fairly decent match, maybe there's more? I was mostly only looking for the "whisperer" bit as I remembered that from ages ago. I'll have a look, see if anything jumps out, if you like?
I vaguely remember something along those lines, but I've been thinking about that. I have a sneaking suspicion it might have actually been on the local noticeboard in Jaques station. I don't think those exist anymore, and don't get published on galnet.

On the other hand, it might have also been on the text in the relay station messages that had clues tu Jaques location. In which case, the could still be searchable in game, if we have records of where they were.

Edit: Found a screenshot of the message.

It's from this reddit post from when he was first found.
