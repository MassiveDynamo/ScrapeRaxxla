Jasmina Halsey and the disappearance of Starship One
This Galnet story that makes me ponder a bit more, there's talk in the stories which may align with The Toast (Codex\Raxxla).
The storyline circulated Galnet in 2015-2016, supported by ingame CG-events (2016) and discussions here in this thread 2019-2022.


In that case, let's see where it can lead us:
First clues are indicators of what to look at in a broad sense : Andromeda, Halsey story.

Further, it can also be supported by ingame mechanics:
What about the ?
The, how are the location & directions. Are there more clues there?

I'll keep pondering.

I agree, I have been going over all the Halsey stuff for a while (I did an article on the whole thing years ago, I've always loved Halsey's story), I've been investigating a lot of hyperspace-realted stuff trying to look for anything related to her mis-jump (that's how I ended up with Witchspace Plants and trying to go through weird stuff like that).

Here's my post collecting all the "whispers" or related to Sirens/sounds that lure people etc.

I have said it many times, but this part I think is the most compelling:
FORMIDINE RIFT ALPHA MISSION 2/6
Expedition Log: 28/08/3270

"... Could have sworn I heard some weird voices in the last jump...”

FORMIDINE RIFT ALPHA MISSION 5/6
Expedition Log: 07/10/3270

“I’m scared… help me someone… I can’t bear another jump. The lights in witch-space are coming for me, the lights… always the lights… they’re calling to me… a siren song… I must join them…”

That's the closest thing I've ever found in-game to that part of the Toast all as one complete thing.
The structure is just so similar:

"to the whisperer in witch-space, the siren of the deepest void!" - Codex
"weird voices in the last jump, they’re calling to me… a siren song". - Formidine Rift

Any good to you?
