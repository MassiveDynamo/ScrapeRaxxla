Not got time this morning to deeply ponder your thinking above (icy roads & got to get grandkids to school for 08:30!), but my immediate response is that I always thought the Duartu Jet Comms PLC half of the Halsey wreckage recovery CG were actually “The Club”. IIRC that is the last time they really made an appearance anywhere. Possibly were trying to close down any investigation/information to be gleaned from the wreckage. Dont know how they could possibly have known about the “Caretakers of the Galaxy” visions she had in her escape pod, more likely trying to cover up evidence of the sabotage. Suspect it has nothing to do with Raxxla storyline, but need to ponder........still not convinced there currently is a Raxxla storyline after MB’s departure and the E/F missions deletion, but don't let my scepticism stop your ruminations!
