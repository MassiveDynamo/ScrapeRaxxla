Just wanted to chime in on the whole "jump through a black hole" idea. Given the game mechanics, I think we are wasting our time with this theory. I don't think the game takes into account what is front of you (or anywhere around you, for that matter) when initiating a jump. I've jumped "through" planetary rings more times than I can count. Also, if a waypoint is behind a plantary or stellar body, the waypoint becomes obfuscated and you have to navigate around said body to get a clear path. So, clearly the game will allow you to jump regardless of what's in front of you, whether it be a ring or a station (anyone else jumped "through" the habitation ring?)...but in the case of planets or stars, it won't allow you to jump....so while(st) I applaud the effort, I don't think that's a tree what needs barking.
