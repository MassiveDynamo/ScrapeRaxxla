Cygnus X-1(the radio source) is a black hole in the V1357 Cygni system, in ED.

HIP 98298 is another name listed on Wikipedia for Cyg X-1. In ED this is the separate system, Star of India.

Star of India and V1357 Cygni do of cource align perfectly from Sol.

Star of India also has the same spooky local map anomaly as Deneb(Alpha Cygni).
I have my destinations to visit for the week, then

I returned from looking for signs of the Mayflower 97, nothing to report. There's still a vast number of systems to check, too much for me unless I'm going to spend the next year looking, depending on how much deviation from the direct course you allow. I think I visited two and half pages' worth of exploration data (so over a hundred systems).
