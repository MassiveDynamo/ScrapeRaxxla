I played with 27 Cass for a while. Got supercharged and went to the BH. There just does not seem to be any way to plot a jump through the BH regardless of what is behind it so supercharging is of no use here. As with all BH's in Elite, none of them seem to have an event horizon as real BH's do. I would have expected to have been sucked into it by it's gravitational pull toward the center. I did look at it with FSS and got some Thagroid sound effects. I'm wondering if you need to have the Guardian Jump Drive Assist mounted on your ship before supercharging and trying to jump through the BH. I did not have one on board, but if someone else does, it might be worth a shot.
No the Guardian Boost module doesn’t make a difference. I went to the BH in my Cutter with the biggest Guardian booster plus I was supercharged. Dropped out of SC and flew towards the BH until I hit the exclusion zone. At that point the BH wasnt very far away. Scary lol. I didn’t notice the thargoid sounds from the BH but the neutron star was just an orgy of whispers with constant thargoid echos.
