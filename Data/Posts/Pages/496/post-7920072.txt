Consider how well Frontier has done with implementing story withing Elite: Dangerous so far. If they do the same stellar job with Raxxla as they've done with their other attempts to create a compelling in-game narrative there will be riots.

There's just a beacon with a recorded message (in ROT13 obviously) saying:

"Raxxla can't come to the phone right now, but leave a message after the tone and she'll get back to you."
