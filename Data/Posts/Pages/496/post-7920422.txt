Are you referring to 27 Cass? I was there and saw that circle around the neutron star as well. I don't know of any neutron stars which "orbit" and the line I thought was an "orbital" line. I also thought I saw one when I apporoched the BH and stopped to circle around it. My first thought was that there must be something orbiting both the BH and NS as the orbital lines only appear for orbiting planetary bodies. Honking/FSS showed no other orbiting bodies in this system, so, I am still confused about what they were. Neutron stars do make noise in the FSS as they are giving off extreme radiation at some frequency, but BH's should not do this. I thought I heard some strange sounds coming from the BH when viewed in FSS.

Why are you asking someone else to sacrafice their ship? Don't you want to be the brave sole who finds Raxxla? And what do you have in mind that would cost someone a ship?
I wasn’t talking about orbit lines, I was referring to exclusion zone lines. And yeah I tried sacrificing a cutter to the Raxxla gods by ramming into the BH, but it didn’t do anything. Shot lasers and munitions into it while pressed against the BH, nothing. However I didn’t try ramming the neutron Star.
