Can someone tell me that all neutron stars “whisper” so that I can stop thinking about it? I can’t play currently but it seemed about as obvious as this quest ever gets. Also thinking back, I never saw a circle around the neutron star on approach. Maybe I wasn’t close enough but I feel like the exclusion zone lines appear much further away than I got. Anyone down to sacrifice their ship for science?
