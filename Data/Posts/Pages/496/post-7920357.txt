Cygnus X-1(the radio source) is a black hole in the V1357 Cygni system, in ED.

HIP 98298 is another name listed on Wikipedia for Cyg X-1. In ED this is the separate system, Star of India.

Star of India and V1357 Cygni do of cource align perfectly from Sol.

Star of India also has the same spooky local map anomaly as Deneb(Alpha Cygni).
I reached the Star of India system today but the FSS shows nothing. I'll fly a circuit in SC to check via parralax for anything hidden nearby later today. What is the system map anomaly you mention? It looks normal to me. There is different music that is played when zoomed out and zoomed in, perhaps because when zoomed in you're within the perimeter of the star and every type of body has it's own music.
