Anyway, for the people who are looking for clues pointing to the presence or not of Raxxla in game, it shows that FD had at least the intention of implementing a story involving Raxxla.
Now, is there actually such a story line (personal journey) in game ? Or has it been pulled back along the E/F missions ?
