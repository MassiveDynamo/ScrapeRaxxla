Mmm, the way the Thargoids harvest at barnacles sucking everything up, including rocks and SRVs etc, looks a lot like anti-gravity to me!
Or perhaps it’s a tractor beam? What’s the difference between tractor beam and anti-gravity?? I must have fallen asleep during that lecture in my Physics course!
Maybe they create a vacuum to suck it up out of the, err, already existing vacuum. Or electromagnetic attraction. Or handwavium.
