Yes, maybe they had specific Thargoid lore for the authors who wrote specifically about them? I’m getting confused because this cropped up in the IRH Discord recently & Scytale (remember him?) was there and corrected me. He said the restriction was “Raxxla, Thargs and antigravity” and it was on Drew's twitch channel. Which may also be why I’m getting confused as I can’t stand twitch (& rapidly going off Facebook!) so must have got the quote either second or third hand. Just did a search for drew’s posts re this on the forum & only got “Raxxla”
The Quest To Find Raxxla
Hello Commanders, I'm sharing this with you in the case you missed it: http://www.drewwagar.com/progress-report/raxxla-the-definitive-guide/ From the wording chosen by Drew I'd bet that he doesn't know the location, only DB. Then I have an idea, if you remove all filters from the map, you can...

I believe the off limits subjects for all the authors were/are Raxxla, Time Travel, and Artificial* Gravity.

*In the sense of ‘magical’ Artificial Gravity. AG through an accelerating frame of reference is fine.


Anti-gravity and Artificial Gravity often get conflated, but they’re two different things. The latter is definitely a ‘no’ for the ED universe. The former I’m not so sure. I wouldn’t be surprised if the authors were told to stay away from it as well though.

I would have thought Sentient AI would also have been made off limits, but I don’t think I’ve seen it specifically mentioned.

I suspect the Thargs was more under strict FD control as opposed to being absolutely off-limits.

Maybe Drew can clarify at some point, but I think the above is fairly accurate. (Or accurate enough for the purposes of this thread anyway.)
