I think there’s a combo of hearing things 3rd and 4th hand, people getting the wrong end of the stick, and various language barriers that go on.

The mix up of the two AG’s is a classic example. One is definitely out and I’m pretty sure DB has said it explicitly. That IIRC correctly was said as a general rule/principle for the ED universe, and not just as a 'it's there but you can't write about it' restriction for the authors.

The other one, well, I’m not personally sure they’ve actually explicitly said that one is out in the same way.

It could certainly be argued that SC and wormholes involve a spacetime curvature that’s opposite to that which we experience as gravity, and is therefore anti-gravity.

On the other hand, humanity (at least publicly) in ED doesn’t have what anti-gravity tech classically is in sci-fi; something that provides a propellant-less thrust in the opposite direction to gravity (in a gravitational field).

It's very likely they told the authors to stay away from that type of anti-gravity, even if it's not a hard restriction on the ED universe, because it just opens up a huge can of worms for them if one of the authors were to feature it in their books when it doesn't feature otherwise in the ED universe.

Same principle for Time Travel - it's a huge can of worms. So even if it's not an absolute hard restriction on the ED universe, it would almost certainly nevertheless be a no-go topic.

Having said all that, I'm sure there must be a definitive version of the no-go topics somewhere.

Mmm, the way the Thargoids harvest at barnacles sucking everything up, including rocks and SRVs etc, looks a lot like anti-gravity to me!
Or perhaps it’s a tractor beam? What’s the difference between tractor beam and anti-gravity?? I must have fallen asleep during that lecture in my Physics course!
