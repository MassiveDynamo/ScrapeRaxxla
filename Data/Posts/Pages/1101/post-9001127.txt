You’ll have to search Drew Wagar’s posts, either this thread or his lore thread. He was the one who spoke of FD’s stipulation, my memory is not good, and IRL I need to get a move on, breakfast time has been too long already!

Edit: sorry, that sounds a bit terse. I’m in a bit of pain at the moment-left hip playing up since mid December and sat for half an hour typing on iPad is getting to me. You are quite right re Thargoids! Han_Zen May remember Drew’s exact phrasing, or best to find Drew’s original posting.
All I remember is that Raxxla was absolutely of limits. That was the reason for the creation of Soontil.
