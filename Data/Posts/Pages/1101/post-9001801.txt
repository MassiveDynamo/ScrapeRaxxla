Mmm, the way the Thargoids harvest at barnacles sucking everything up, including rocks and SRVs etc, looks a lot like anti-gravity to me!
Or perhaps it’s a tractor beam? What’s the difference between tractor beam and anti-gravity?? I must have fallen asleep during that lecture in my Physics course!
One moves the ship. The other's the ship moving other things.

The Thargoid ship's movement itself is one of those things that does look very anti-gravity in style. Is it the same tech that then also does the tractor beam effect? Quite possibly. (Equally, it might not be! )

Anyway, found the DB thing on artificial gravity:


"the only artificial gravity will be that created by centripetal force from rotation of (for example) a large space station."
