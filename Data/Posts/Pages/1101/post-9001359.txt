I believe the off limits subjects for all the authors were/are Raxxla, Time Travel, and Artificial* Gravity.

*In the sense of ‘magical’ Artificial Gravity. AG through an accelerating frame of reference is fine.


Anti-gravity and Artificial Gravity often get conflated, but they’re two different things. The latter is definitely a ‘no’ for the ED universe. The former I’m not so sure. I wouldn’t be surprised if the authors were told to stay away from it as well though.

I would have thought Sentient AI would also have been made off limits, but I don’t think I’ve seen it specifically mentioned.

I suspect the Thargs was more under strict FD control as opposed to being absolutely off-limits.

Maybe Drew can clarify at some point, but I think the above is fairly accurate. (Or accurate enough for the purposes of this thread anyway.)

Mmm, I thought time travel was in there, but Scytale called me out & said it was anti-gravity.
