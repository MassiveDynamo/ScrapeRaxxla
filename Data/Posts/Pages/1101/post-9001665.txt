Having said all that, I'm sure there must be a definitive version of the no-go topics somewhere.
They had internal lore guides (written prior to launch, so changes occurred by the time the game arrived also) that summarized the do's and don'ts and forbidden topics as well. All under NDA of course so even now I think official authors have to be careful what they say and how they say it. But apparently the game content/story has moved away from those internal guides in recent years per Drew (IIRC) so the original guides are likely outdated. End result there are some things referenced in the books that aren't in game (i.e. misjumps, dark systems) and vice versa, plus things that are referenced differently (i.e. Soontill).
