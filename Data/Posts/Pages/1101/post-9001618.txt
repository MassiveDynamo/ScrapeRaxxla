Just for you guys to perform a short excersise regarding "secret bases/stations" then we can imagine what we would be actually looking for or maybe some better ways to tackle the problem:

1. Choose an engineer you have no knowledge yet nor have received any invitation;
2. Go pay such engineer a visit;
3. Even using advanced surface scanner you won't be able to locate its base;
4. Unless you know in advance its location and fly there;
5. Believe me, you won't be treated with a welcome hail.

So, does come to mind any other secretive base/station we'd need an invitation to get to its location?

Maybe we need to rethink our approach on the subject...

Ya last week I was playing around with trying to identify a station in orbit using just the old mark 1 eyeballs.... very tricky. Assuming nothing comes up on scanners finding these things without clues could be very tricky. Maybe geostationary orbits or polar orbits... could be found by giving coordinates.... but ya coming up with a search pattern would be beneficial.
