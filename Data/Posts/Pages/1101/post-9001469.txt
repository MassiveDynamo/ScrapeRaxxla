Just for you guys to perform a short excersise regarding "secret bases/stations" then we can imagine what we would be actually looking for or maybe some better ways to tackle the problem:

1. Choose an engineer you have no knowledge yet nor have received any invitation;
2. Go pay such engineer a visit;
3. Even using advanced surface scanner you won't be able to locate its base;
4. Unless you know in advance its location and fly there;
5. Believe me, you won't be treated with a welcome hail.

So, does come to mind any other secretive base/station we'd need an invitation to get to its location?

Maybe we need to rethink our approach on the subject...
