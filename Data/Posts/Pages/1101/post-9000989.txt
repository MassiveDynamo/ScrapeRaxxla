Out of the Darkness by T. James deals with Thargoids - Oresrians and Klaxians come from that novel.
Thargoids are a theme in John Harper's And here the Wheel too.
You’ll have to search Drew Wagar’s posts, either this thread or his lore thread. He was the one who spoke of FD’s stipulation, my memory is not good, and IRL I need to get a move on, breakfast time has been too long already!

Edit: sorry, that sounds a bit terse. I’m in a bit of pain at the moment-left hip playing up since mid December and sat for half an hour typing on iPad is getting to me. You are quite right re Thargoids! Han_Zen May remember Drew’s exact phrasing, or best to find Drew’s original posting.
