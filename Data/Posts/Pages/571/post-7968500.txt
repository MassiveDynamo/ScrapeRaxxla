The Zurara was already dead. Nothing to do (would have been too cool !), end of the story.
The legendary TDW secret home base is supposed alive, with traffic, operations running, etc.. I can't believe "mostly nothing" would happen. Come on.
But I do believe nobody has the slightest idea how that could be managed in terms of gameplay and storyline. Not even FD. (Besides, the mandatory tourist beacon, of course)
EDIT: oh sorry ! I have an idea. You find the station, it vaporizes you instatnly and the jumps to another system so people can start the quest again. Anything else ?

It's a sandbox.

No, I think the penguin has it correct. We know what npc do now- if you follow them they might make a couple of jumps then simply disappear. FD aren’t going to programme a whole set of realistic npc behaviours just for TDW station. If npc had intelligent capability we would have already observed it in-game. I suspect TDW station and Raxxla itself are just pretty easter eggs to be found and then forgotten. I can’t see them having any sparkling new mechanisms or storyline attached, although I half expect Raxxla to transport the finder to a small separate part of the game, perhaps inside a permit-locked region, possibly into Col70 to make some new insectoid friends...
