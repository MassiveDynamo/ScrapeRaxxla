Given the track record to date, I'm tempted to believe the "journey" is the simplest thing on offer - a permit lock, and anyone getting the permit has to meet a certain prerequisite or set of prerequisites: whether that is finding TDW station, visiting a series of systems in a certain order, getting allied with whoever, selling a certain amount of commodities to certain faction(s), being triple (or quadruple, gods forbid, elite) &c. &c. or all of the above. It could even be tied into, shudder, Powerplay. At one point it might have simply been completing a certain set of missions that were likely completely bugged, but those seem to have been taken out of the game. Whatever you do, don't sell any Unknown Artefacts. Far too simple a solution for a game story mechanic, right?

And as they have killed Galnet, clearly there were never any Raxxla clues there. Or if there were they are no longer relevant and have been retconned out.
There is no journey.
The journey was to become Elite and then find hints tha Raxxla was in the game, by doing the old Founders missions. They never did anything else.

Now we have the codex that tells us Raxxla is in the game. No more journey needed.

No sector permits can be obtained. They have never existed. At least not at launch.
