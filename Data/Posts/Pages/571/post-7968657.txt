Yeah, just what I said. Ordinary missions.
Of course those types are gone ! Your fault, Boss !
Only hope, imho, are the tip-offs.
Can't see anything Raxxla/TDW related in these " E/F missions" of today...
I do have one tipoff mission in the Pleiades Sector, nothing special I would imagine.
SPOILER


Edit: Pretty uneventful.
