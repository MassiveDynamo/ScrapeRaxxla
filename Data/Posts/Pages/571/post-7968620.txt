Curious, all my triple accounts currently docked at Jameson Memorial are all offered Founder / Elite missions.
Also, not a Founder.

Founders got access to Shin without needing to be Elite. In the old days you needed to have the appropriate rank to take a mission, so I assume the Founder/Elite missions were specifically created for that subset of players. They only appear in Shin, right?
