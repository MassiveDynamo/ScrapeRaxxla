So basically saying, game content is dull. It seems like they notice us paying attention to something in game that motivated people to play. and instead of building on this and making it in game element, they say they are going to stop. Where was the actual logic to this? It's like they want us bored
There are interesting stories in-game, but they are rare. The day to day stuff are number games, like CGs, BGS, Thargoid war and Power Play. I tend to skip those articles.

I rather read nonsense from Riccardo Bentonio, than the latest Power Play report.
