No, I think the penguin has it correct. We know what npc do now- if you follow them they might make a couple of jumps then simply disappear. FD aren’t going to programme a whole set of realistic npc behaviours just for TDW station. If npc had intelligent capability we would have already observed it in-game. I suspect TDW station and Raxxla itself are just pretty easter eggs to be found and then forgotten. I can’t see them having any sparkling new mechanisms or storyline attached, although I half expect Raxxla to transport the finder to a small separate part of the game, perhaps inside a permit-locked region, possibly into Col70 to make some new insectoid friends...
So what ? The station stays there, floating in space? Like dead ? No possible interaction ? The Powers and the Club looking elsewhere ? Everything going on as always ?
So happy I shelved that game, if so !
And I can't assume that all the TDW NPCs were followed until their last destination. Who can ? Not saying that would have changed anything, eh ?
We know nothing.
