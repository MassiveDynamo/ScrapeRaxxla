Be that as it may, I’m beginning to reconsider this approach- I can’t see that it has any relation to “a journey we all must travel”. The only thing that seems to make sense of that clue, I think, is that the toast represents coordinates of objects that need to be visited in sequence. And also the fact that some of the toasted objects are invisible through dust obscuration...

Given the track record to date, I'm tempted to believe the "journey" is the simplest thing on offer - a permit lock, and anyone getting the permit has to meet a certain prerequisite or set of prerequisites: whether that is finding TDW station, visiting a series of systems in a certain order, getting allied with whoever, selling a certain amount of commodities to certain faction(s), being triple (or quadruple, gods forbid, elite) &c. &c. or all of the above. It could even be tied into, shudder, Powerplay. At one point it might have simply been completing a certain set of missions that were likely completely bugged, but those seem to have been taken out of the game. Whatever you do, don't sell any Unknown Artefacts. Far too simple a solution for a game story mechanic, right? <edit> cough Polaris </edit>

And as they have killed Galnet, clearly there were never any Raxxla clues there. Or if there were they are no longer relevant and have been retconned out.
