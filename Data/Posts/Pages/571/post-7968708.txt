There is no journey.
The journey was to become Elite and then find hints tha Raxxla was in the game, by doing the old Founders missions. They never did anything else.

Now we have the codex that tells us Raxxla is in the game. No more journey needed.

No sector permits can be obtained. They have never existed. At least not at launch.
There are lots of system permits out there that no one has cracked yet though...
