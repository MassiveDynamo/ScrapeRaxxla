Anyone actually chase the coords from the listening post in Delphi? Never noticed it before myself, but it gives a thing about someone being chased (probably by thargs) an incomplete lat and long location, and a statement that the signal is also found in a HIP system and a Pleiades Sector System. Didn’t get a change to chase it myself yesterday as the servers went down for maint.

Just checked the LPs and they still lead to HIP 16613 - The Bug Killer

Excellent resolution - tin foil thread closed.

I for one was fully aware that DB was rather referring to UCBs and not FSP numbers when I compiled that FSP numbers list, because someone posted MBs comment (or a link to that) weeks ago.
I noted the FSP numbers anyhow because I'm interested in how that numbering system works in detail and hope somebody can figure this out. There is a chance that a FSP number list, or the understanding of the numbering system itself, reveals something interesting.
