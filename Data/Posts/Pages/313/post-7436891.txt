If that is the case, it would still be in Sol. It should travel at at least 42 km/s, probably a bit more to escape the gravity of both earth and the sun.

42 Km/s... 15 000 years... Wouldn't that be like 2 Ly ? Out of Sol if so.

EDIT: oops! 2 Ly could very well be assumed to be the extreme outer rim of Oort's cloud !
My bad !

Am I coming back to ED and supercruise 2Ly from Sol in direction of Tau Ceti or the Contact movie Vega ?
meh...
