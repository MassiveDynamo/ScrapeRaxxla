42 Km/s... 15 000 years... Wouln't that be like 2 Ly ? Out of Sol if so.

EDIT: oops! 2 Ly could very well be assumed to be the extreme outer rim of Oort's cloud !
My bad !

Am I coming back to ED and supercruise 2Ly from Sol in direction of Tau Ceti or the Contact movie Vega ?
meh...

2.1 ly is nothing. If it passed at a bit of a distance from eath, it would escape at slower speed.
