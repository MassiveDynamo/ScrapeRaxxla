Princess Astrophel.

There is a fair chance that Princess Astrophel refers to Vega. The stellar weaver princess of east asian mythology, that loves Atair: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cowherd_and_the_Weaver_Girl

If the other stars are spiraling and Vega isn't, that would probably make Vega a Pole star.
The last time Vega was the north pole star, was around 12000 BC or about 15000 years ago(ED time).

The period around 12000 BC was dramatic, both in a scientific and mythological sense. At the end of the ice age the sea levels changed, climate fluctuated and animals like mammoth and saber tooth tiger went extinct.
Some evidence may also point to large comet impacts, in the period.

In mythology the fall of Atlantis, the original story of the great flood and the traditional Maya cataclysm myth are often dated(the supposed events, not the myths) to this period.

Cold this be related to a Rogue planet passing close to earth?

If that is the case, it would still be in Sol. It should travel at at least 42 km/s, probably a bit more to escape the gravity of both earth and the sun.
