Just checked the LPs and they still lead to HIP 16613 - The Bug Killer


I for one was fully aware that DB was rather referring to UCBs and not FSP numbers when I compiled that FSP numbers list, because someone posted MBs comment (or a link to that) weeks ago.
I noted the FSP numbers anyhow because I'm interested in how that numbering system works in detail and hope somebody can figure this out. There is a chance that a FSP number list, or the understanding of the numbering system itself, reveals something interesting.

well here's my results from today's meanderings:
