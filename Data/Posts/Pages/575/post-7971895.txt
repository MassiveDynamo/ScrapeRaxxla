Swing? Walz?
Meh, Salsa or Zydeco for me!

It’s difficult to dance stuck in this pilot’s chair for 4 years. I’ll be glad when space legs arrives & I can stand up, move around, visit the head, and get a mug of coffee from that darn Krait machine that I can smell but not reach.

Gave up BH diving, it got boring after around 30. Dipped into centroid searching, also boring. 3 kylies out, off to visit some bright stars then I’ll head back to the bubble to test out latest wild idea carefully reasoned hypothesis...
