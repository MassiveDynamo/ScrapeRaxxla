There is more detail in this spreadsheet:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eu30UyjpQrWexAglwD1Ax_GaDz4d7l8KD76kSzX4DEk/edit#gid=0

This is a user submitted tourist beacon, so the text is a player's wording. The notes don't mention why he/she/it/they called it that:

0016 Celestial Gem CD-39 6137 TOURIST Series 1 User Submitted 0016.png This minor system in notable only because of its early membership of the Alliance, joining in 3232. This membership granted the colonists significant technological improvement on their existing lot.

<Edit: looks like the text is wrong in the spreadsheet - the picture link shows the correct text.. >

The Beacon numbers go in sets as they were populated. There are quite a few missing beacons in this list, so clearly there is more stuff to be found and a block of them are in the Elite History section. Seems likely that this supports the theory that some of the existing permit locked systems can be unlocked if only we can work out how. Or else the remaining Lore beacons are not in populated or explored bubble systems..


I have a couple of questions for those who were in game at the start:
If they weren't in game for Gamma then you wouldn't need them to find R. as originally implemented. Of course its possible the codex refers to them as part of the retconn.

The system is in the blue nebula NGC3132. The system has a Y star with 8 'moons' - if you accept Y's as gas giants...



May be worth a look, just to be sure

The beacons are a relatively new addition to ED. I don't remember exactly when they were introduced, but it was well after Horizons.

The 'Celestial Gem' name comes from the Galactic mapping project. A player initiative to name distinctive systems, regions and sectors. Quite a few of these names have later been added to the game, by FD.

The Galactic mapping project has it's own entry in EDSM:
