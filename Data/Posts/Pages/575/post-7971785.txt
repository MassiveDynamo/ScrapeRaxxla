Burnell Station (an outpost) orbits the non-landable Venus. Presumably after Jocelyn Bell-Burnell - discoverer of pulsars - not quite the 'Mother of Galaxies' though. I expect its the least visited station in Sol though..
ED uses a geocentric model, meaning that Earth is the center of the galaxy (as in co-ordinates 0,0,0), so mother of galaxies could be poetic license? Venus is the brightest planet from the center of the galaxy.
