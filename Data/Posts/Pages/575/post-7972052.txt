Offtop ...what is ur Krait jump range? >: I could do 52 ly but ... I feel like 72 conda is better...
...damn, I want to pilot Krait more, I just love it.

65ly, I love this ship!
You can get better range with an annie, but manoeuvrability goes down.

Edit:64.28 to 68. But not a pure exploration fit-Iâ€™ve got beam laser, MC, dual PA (plasma slug), plus dual AFMU and repair limpet controller. Not a pvp fit (not into that) but a good armed explorer.
