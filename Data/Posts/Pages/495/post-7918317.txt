Ok so heres a thought on the Princess Astrophel and the Spiraling stars...

In MBs book Elite Legacy... Julia mentions her only entertainment as a child was "a single book about a young man's quest to save a princess from an alien dragon. My father must have bought it on the black market. He couldn't have got it from anywhere else."

Im going to go out on a limb and suggest: Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster. Princes Selinas body gets taken over by a Venutian to warn earth about an alien dragon ....

There is a Trio of assassins in Elite Legacy - one of which is named Seline (her fathers name is Rex...) Rex(king) is also the grandfather of Julia.

Could the be the same as Halseys Caretakers, or the Sirens of the deepest void?

So we need to find the Omphalos ... or in this case the Egg of Mothra... and beg her to fight off the Thargoids ?

I'm not sure about Ghidorah but that is a nice find in Elite Legacy about a children's book regarding a princess.
