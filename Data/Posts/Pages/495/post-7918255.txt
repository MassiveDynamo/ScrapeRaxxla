I super charged my drive and flew right into the BH, there was a blue hue and the strange distortion effects, but nothing that seems too anomalous. I'm more interested into the nebula/galaxy in the skybox. It's not part of the galmap skybox or a nearby nebula. Can anybody identify it?

Video of the encounter starts with FSS audio of the black hole.

I have also made a video to capture the ambient audio of the black hole. It's probably nothing important.
