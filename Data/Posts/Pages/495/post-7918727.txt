I'm finally online and decided to check this out myself. This is a really interesting system, a collection of relatively unique star types and some interesting neighbours. I haven't been following the mythology side of things too well, but the LBN 623 nebula really stands out on my approach to the black hole. Looks like some kind of burning jewel.

Images supplied:

Edit: The highlighted nebula is not actually LBN 623, the distorted smudge to the right is. Does anyone know what it is I've highlighted? It's not on the galmap skybox either.
