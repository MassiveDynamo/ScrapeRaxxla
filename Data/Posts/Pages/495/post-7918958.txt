FWIW, when you first put up the image of the Summer Triangle, the first thing I thought was that Cygnus X-1 ought to be somewhere near the centre of it. It's in-game under the designation V1357 Cygni. Obviously, there are other potentially interesting places but this was what jumped out at me.

In my search along the path from Tau Ceti to HIP 8178, looking for signs of the Mayflower 97, I've noticed that there are many unmapped worlds in that region. There's certainly the possibility that something could have been hidden in that direction from the Bubble without anyone noticing (readily) until post 3.3. I've completed the outward journey and most of the way back, the latter filtering for unvisited stars. No sign of other Generation Ships or planetary POIs.
Cygnus X-1(the radio source) is a black hole in the V1357 Cygni system, in ED.

HIP 98298 is another name listed on Wikipedia for Cyg X-1. In ED this is the separate system, Star of India.

Star of India and V1357 Cygni do of cource align perfectly from Sol.

Star of India also has the same spooky local map anomaly as Deneb(Alpha Cygni).
