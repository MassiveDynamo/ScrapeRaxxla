I'm not sure about Ghidorah but that is a nice find in Elite Legacy about a children's book regarding a princess.

Ya i was going through the books i had on my old kindle... Was a bit of a surprise

Also the system where Legacy takes place is Artemis and it has a planet Laphria (bee).... Just seems to fit certain themes.

As to Ghidorah.. No one believed Princes Selene either.. till it was almost too late.
