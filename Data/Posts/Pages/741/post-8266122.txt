I was looking at some screen shots i took over the past year. after some recent discussion where someone posted the inside of a Coriolis station comparing it to the raxxla symbol, i couldnt help but start counting the lights around a 'wheel' station (toroid?). Anyways, is it just me or is there the same number of lights as the dots/dashes in the raxxla image?

Or is it space madness?

P.S. i ran out of tin foil a few months back....

p.p.s i just mean the outer most set of lights around the inner ring

I count 31, whereas I thought the Raxxla icon had 34? But I’ve been postulating for ages that Raxxla may be a station/giant spaceship, possibly Guardian.

Of course it’s space madness; you’re a Raxxla Questor, it’s mandatory!
