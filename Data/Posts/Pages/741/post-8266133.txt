I count 31, whereas I thought the Raxxla icon had 34? But I’ve been postulating for ages that Raxxla may be a station/giant spaceship, possibly Guardian.

Of course it’s space madness; you’re a Raxxla Questor, it’s mandatory!
There is one light hidden behind one of the arms. Its the bottom most downward pointing arm. If you zoom in you can see the light emitting from behind it, so i counted it. I got the impression there were discrepancies between different 'raxxla images' having different numbers. Not sure which is more correct.
