I've been delving into some of the historical videos available from the official Elite Dangerous YouTube channel to see if there are any tip-bits in chats/releases/updates that might help us out a bit.

During this video:
Join the Elite - Everything You Need to Know About Exploration



Michael Brooks makes an interesting point about SagA* (time ~26:30m ) being a special case, which I don't have context for, so I'm reaching out for collective ideas since I don't quite get if the reference. Is he referring that SagA* is actually different for known scientific reasons, or is it a special case because FDEV have decided to make it so?

He also mentions that another system was renamed, but deliberately they both choose not to reveal the original name (time ~36:30m).

Thoughts on these comments?

Just finished watching this vid & found only two interesting things (I’ve done a lot of exploration!). The first thing I was the statement that FD have plans for Gas Giants but he couldn’t talk about them, perhaps that’s one of the enhancements in the major update this year....perhaps floating lifeforms/materials that can be scooped? Or floating landable platforms?
The second thing was that nobody asked anything about Raxxla!
