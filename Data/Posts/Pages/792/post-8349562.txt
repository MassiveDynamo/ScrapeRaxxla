I hope you can watch it to the end, and pls let me know what you think about 5 dots and the civ installation.

Im not a content creator either but as a viewer it was fine to watch

5 Dots - not sure, will leave to more scientific minds, not sure there is anything to it as lots of stars are unreachable atm

Power Conduits - yes they are on other installations, seen them a few times, never paid attention to how common but have seen them and the 'electric generator' thing inside the station, theyre in a few as well. Don't know what their use or purpose is if any, theyre in the CQC arena as well in some. Think theres a couple of variations of them.

Recon Limpets - are you sure they weren't getting hit by the equivalent of installation Point Defence? A lot of fire going on, it was hard for me to see what the limpet was doing exactly and how it died. Try engaging Silent Running before launching limpet and keep it on until its hacked if it works, that way you get no bounty and no defences fire on you. Would be clearer whats actually happening on screen without the explosions?

Theory - I think I understood it, its as valid as any other and well researched, in the end that quest for knowledge may be what Raxxla actually is so who can say?
