I'm like 95% sure raxxla is located in an asteroid field. There's too many technical and common sense reasons for it to be hidden there than as a naked stellar object in a system.

So people who are only interested in interesting planets or stars will miss raxxla. Only masochists will take the time to explore roid belts enough to find it. It's almost surely not very far from the bubble. It wouldn't have to be and it would make the most sense lore-wise if it is very close relatively.

edit: I wish fdev hid fun things to find out in the black but there's only been two instances of fdev attempting that and both were bungled and part of a main narrative that either spoon fed the path or bungled the secret entirely). The black is empty...devoid of anything interesting and trying to find meaning to the inclusion of hundreds of thousands of systems with nothing in them will drive you insane. It's all there.. it's pointless to visit them, there's no chance of you stumbling onto something nobody else has found way out in the boonies.
