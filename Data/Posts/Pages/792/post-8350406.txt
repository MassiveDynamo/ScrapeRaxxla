Thank you so much for the answer. Any response, negative or positive appreciated. I am just trying to find it. Not claiming anything at all. My motivation point is the alignment of that white dot with Regulus and Sol. Do you think is it a coincidence? Or is it put there for a reason?

The other installation things however, as i mentioned, might be programming bugs or something like that. However, there are too many bugs together in a place which has name "Delphi". Ä±f that installation had a name like Bobby's Fried Doodles, or Aisling Corporation, i would say meh and move along.

I'm torn regarding things aligning with a (static) skybox. It relies a bit on the imprecise previous assumption(s). I think also if you find major systems (Roman/Greek/Babylonial/Arabic/.. culture) you may be able to align those with background sky objects as well. That would be a negative test to disprove it, but it would take a bit of work.

It's equally important to look at both positive findings to affirm your theory as well as looking at negative findings that goes against it. Basically not closing our eyes for things we don't like so that we don't spend time on things that we connected the dots where it suited us and ignored the rest.
My gut feeling is that skybox is a skybox and it's a bit of coincident that you happened to align that system with it.

Sorry I don't mean to be judgemental, I hope you can find more findings to support it. I would go back to looking at something closer to 50s though, instead of 59s.
And perhaps test out your new Fleet Carrier up there when that time comes.

Good luck, Raven. o7
