Tinfoil!

At Pencil Sector EL-Y D5 system. Ruling faction is 'Seven Stages Movement' (already thinking 7 Stages / 7 Veils? = 7 stages of something), got allied and now on my intro screen is Founder Winnie Decker! Founder! Decker! Coincidence or fluff or something else?

Your intro screen?
Did some research there as well. but no result like you're speaking of that I know of. Managed to get 1 tip-off.
Wiki gives 3 results for seven stages.
