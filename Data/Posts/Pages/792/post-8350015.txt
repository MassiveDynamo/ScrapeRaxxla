Tinfoil!

At Pencil Sector EL-Y D5 system. Ruling faction is 'Seven Stages Movement' (already thinking 7 Stages / 7 Veils? = 7 stages of something), got allied and now on my intro screen is Founder Winnie Decker! Founder! Decker! Coincidence or fluff or something else?
Nice tinfoil - does it come in Orange?
First, I don't know (or recall) Decker, is it form one of the novels? It's been a while since I read them.
Secondly, I'm a bit cautious since Drew already stated there is no link between the stories from his work.
I do find a lot of 'soft links' all the time, I mean constantly. But I tryy to look at how it alings with the rest of the hints given in the past, MB statements, Codex and Mission clues.

But that being said, when you're passionate about something go chase it down. Because this is what makes you a better investigator than anybody around you.
I'd love to hear if you find more cool evidence along your journey. o7

Intro screen - I meant the main Starport Services screen, the first one that open with all the facilities on it and has a picture of a person 'welcoming' you to the station above the News Feed.
Ah, yeah that makes sense now that you're allied. The owner faction always does that.

Good luck, I hope you find some more leads. o7
