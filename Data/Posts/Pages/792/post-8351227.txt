I’ll intervene a little in your plan, but as the most experienced you can tell in the installation of the Targoids which objects were placed besides the requiem of the guards? I’ll give you a thought, but what if the toast points to objects that need to be inserted there? this is all very relevant to the concept of MMO and the history of the game.
