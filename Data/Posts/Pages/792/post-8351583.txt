I’ll intervene a little in your plan, but as the most experienced you can tell in the installation of the Targoids which objects were placed besides the requiem of the guards? I’ll give you a thought, but what if the toast points to objects that need to be inserted there? this is all very relevant to the concept of MMO and the history of the game.

If I understand you correctly, you're talking about the Thargoid installation showing the star map?

If so, I think a multitude of objects have been attempted to be placed in the installation without positive results. Guardian artefacts trigger a (very?) negative effect by the installation. Having said that, I can try to have look at the toast and see if I can map any rares to the toast. There's ~140 rares so this may take some time

Btw, good idea.
