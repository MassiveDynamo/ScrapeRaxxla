I am making a very long trip between the Saggitarius- Carina Arm and the Scutum-Centarus Arm. I'm maxing at 30LY jumps (w/out any boosts) and plan to arrive in the abyss sometime later this year. Any places you all would like me to swing by and investigate? I'm spending a few minutes in most systems doing FSS scans (when I detect metal rich/WW/or gas giants) and considerably longer when I spot an interesting planet so adding a week to do a thorough investigation of a particular region is no issue for me. I upload all my information to eddb/inara/etc. so any info should become available there as I fly through them.
