Not just EDDB or EDSM but actually got 1st mapped in game, think about 10-20% of players are on EDDB/EDSM and upload data so that's only as good as the info it does have but yes youre right, a lot of searches are starting with wholly incomplete and inaccurate data to begin with....which brings us nicely back to Raxxla
