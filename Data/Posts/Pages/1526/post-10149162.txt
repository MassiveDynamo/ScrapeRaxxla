I was having a gander at the Raxxla symbol in the game again. I can’t help but feel that the center circle and dot represents the sun. It is the symbol for the sun and considering everything else that the devs have done there’s no way they don’t know that and they know that’s what people will see it as.
But then there’s the three circle segments around the sun. I suppose those can be interpreted in various ways and indeed they have.
But, the only thing I’m aware of that exists only in a set of three in the solar system is triaxial ellipsoid dwarf planets. They are Makemake, Eris, and Haumea.
The dotted outer line could represent the orbit of Persephone, a planet oddly added into game that we don’t actually know exists.
Persephone is of course, the parents grief and the livers woe.
When she’s gone hades in the winter, Demeter, her mother, grieves her being away and causes winter. And in the warm months Hades is aggrieved by her absence as well.
Persephone ate 6 pomegranate seeds and there are six outer shapes to the symbol. Kinda looks like a cut pomegranate too.
