Neptue is my pick in Sol, as well. The arcs of the rings have always made it a little extra interesting.
Itâ€™s also possible to extract a trident (two, end to end) from the Raxxla symbol.
In adition the south pole of Neptune points to Regor, the home of the dead. This puts the north pole in the middle of the magpie bridge.

There is also the moon Despina, named after the half sister of Cora and daughter of Demeter. Despina was supposedly important in the Eulysian mysteries.

Edit: Despina obits in the rings, as does a few other moons.
Can you clarify? I cant see any tridents in the logo image!
