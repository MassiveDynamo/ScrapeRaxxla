Do rings rotate around their planets? Just asked to make sure it won't be too easy.
Yes, they do. I always imagined that the RNG would provide stronger opponents in a HazRes during the time it spent the shadow of a Gas Giant. The RNG probably doesn't work that way, but the shadow is temporary, and so the rings are moving.
