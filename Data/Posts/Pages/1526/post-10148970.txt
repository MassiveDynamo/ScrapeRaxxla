Neptue is my pick in Sol, as well. The arcs of the rings have always made it a little extra interesting.
It’s also possible to extract a trident (two, end to end) from the Raxxla symbol.
In adition the south pole of Neptune points to Regor, the home of the dead. This puts the north pole in the middle of the magpie bridge.

There is also the moon Despina, named after the half sister of Cora and daughter of Demeter. Despina was supposedly important in the Eulysian mysteries.

Edit: Despina obits in the rings, as does a few other moons.
Neptune? No, the rings of Neptune dont match up with the anagram ( well, Lassell does but only if you ignore the last “l”)...no, I’m plumping for Saturn “the jewel of the solar system”...for me the three arcs of the G ring sells it as the target location...just cant find the darned thing! Fancy FD not implementing the G ring!!!

Treating “Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars” as an anagram then the solution “At the Pallene ring arc in Sol” leaves outstanding letters “ss srp nd the Spia”, but I cant see any addition using those left over letters that can clarify the solution
