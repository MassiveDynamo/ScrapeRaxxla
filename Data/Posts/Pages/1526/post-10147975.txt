I use a robot cutter at the cabin. There's about 1000 m3 of lawn there. If we don't go there for a couple weeks, it gets totally unmanageable. The robot works at night and keeps the grass short.
When the grass is short all the time, the dandelions and the moss doesn't get a foothold.
Hope its not sentient, cos they're banned!
