Ooooohhh

Well i was thinking about a search strategy. I havent tried it yet but we could go to saturn till we get close enough to see the planetary coordinates . Then line up on even degrees and on same plane as the rings then… keeping your back to saturn you head out and survey through the ring like a cross section till we are through. Then rinse and repeat… And we do it 360 times - or maybe every10 degrees so only 36 crossections…. Not perfect but would provide a systematic sample….

I can put together a basic search plot and log sheet when i get off work.


BLAH - Ok that didnt work, Not getting any planetary coordinates. So I got nothing.
