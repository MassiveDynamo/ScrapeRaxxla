Do you have the name of the other unknowns in sol?
What other unknowns in sol? the only thing missing as i know was Body21 all Body IDs are used.

So i have this
SPOILER

I can check if there is something beyond 46

EDIT: why i have not done it in SOL everywere eles i looked past the highest ID
"StarSystem":"Sol", "SystemAddress":10477373803, "Body":"Daedalus", "BodyID":47, "BodyType":"Station" }
thats the first time i see a Station whit an ID like that.

EDIT EDIT: nevermind seem normal for Station to have an ID just was mostly in Systems whitout any Stations.
