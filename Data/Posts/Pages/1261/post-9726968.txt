more like lots of (23) comets:

EDIT: only now realized half the Isinor system are comets that are not in Game

Nothing fancy found today, only empty Space.
Still this method allows to wipe some of the suspects from our lists.
I will try and explain how it works later.

One can argue that it is an bug and should not be used to try to solve our puzzle
One can also argue that this is indeed the solution. It is a tool that allows access to things that are extremely if not impossible to access without it.
However, I leave this up to everyone to decide for themselves.

- i reported 18 month ago that makes this posible.

Here some observations:
-A Belt has the same Center as its parent. If a Belt gets selected via SystemMap it will target the first Cluster e.g SomeStar AB Belt Cluster 1.
-However, if the Belt has no Clusters it will target the Center of the Belt, so it seems the Belt is in the center of its Star. e.g SOL
-I have not seen any NPCs at the "Comets" but i have seen them entering SC from those locations as i was approaching.
-Some Systems i could not targed any Body whit this. But since they have all been Layer 7 (H massCodeSystems), i may just have done some convertion wrong

Another thought i had today while looking up Fullerene C60 was. One can argue it looks alot like the RAXXLA Logo from the Codex (aka my Next target since there is a System called like that)

I try to understand since an hour how to enter in a comet signal but can't understand (your link is about how to crash galmap).

Btw, for NonBodyCount, fleet carriers are counted in this category! I have logs from Colonia (i was there 2 years ago) and the number seem to vary:

I post 2 log parts, one with 139 NonBodies and one with 135

SPOILER: SPOILER

SPOILER: SPOILER

So, with this log, i can tell:

Counted as "NonBodyCount":
Notable stellar phenomena
Belt
Belt Chunk
Ring
Tourist Beacon
Ressource Extraction Sites
Listening Posts
Nav Beacon
Fleet Carriers
Stations
Space Installations
Megaships
I suppose: Permament signal sources (I only know Algol for now, where you can find "Earth Relics")

When in Scanner mode, it says "XX signals", can someone compare this to the NonBodyCount pls?
I'm thinking: if the count always match, we can find TDW station if we have a difference of 1 (as it doesn't appear in scanners).

Edit: Sry, i forgot the spoiler beacon.
