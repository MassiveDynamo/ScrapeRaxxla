I have started to come the conclusion that it must be somewhere in sol. Since its allowed only for elite cmdrs. But find a moon or a portal thats small far from sol its hard. I have tried many times in sol.
Sol is not only allowed for Elite CMDRS you could be a middle rank and get the permit as it is the Federation that give it, I think you mean the Founders system Shinrarta
