Nice done .
"I am not going to tell you how i found it" => Can you just answer this: did you find/target it after a honk or did you use another way?

While out in the black i'm still checking logs to understand how BodyIDs are done in-game:
Honking will not show them no matter how close you are.
But after some testing and magic after my initial succses yesterday, i am now able to SupercruiseExit in any SOI of any Body
I would explain but it may is a bug that i don't want get fixed. (even though i reported something similar 19 month ago but still is not fixed. in fact it got worse. But it is very spezial and no one sems to care)

Here are ur missing Bodys 8 & 9 for Pi Andromedae but they are also just empty Space.
