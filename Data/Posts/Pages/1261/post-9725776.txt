Nice done .
"I am not going to tell you how i found it" => Can you just answer this: did you find/target it after a honk or did you use another way?

While out in the black i'm still checking logs to understand how BodyIDs are done in-game:

Counted as "NonBodyCount":
Notable stellar phenomena
Belt (Group)
Belt (Chunk)
Ring
Tourist Beacon

Counted as "Bodies":
Stars
Planets (landable or not landable)
"Small Body" => See post 25,262 (CMDR Pyroboros) with Halley's Comet.

For the "NonBodyCount", there are some stuffs i seem to miss, but don't know what for the moment (maybe space installations?)
The only civilizations on my way back are H&S nebulas, i'll check that there.

But for example, "PI Andromedae" 's discovery log:
(Paste it in Notepad++ to see lines easier)

SPOILER: PI ANDROMEDAE

Now look at system map picture: there are 2 missing "BodyIDs" (8 & 9) between bodies ABC3 and the barycentre of bodies ABC4/ABC5.
All the bodies are counted and look that:

"BodyCount":10, "NonBodyCount":0

Some BodyIDs are neither counted as Body nor NonBody.

So what could it be?

For Sol:

SPOILER: SOL
