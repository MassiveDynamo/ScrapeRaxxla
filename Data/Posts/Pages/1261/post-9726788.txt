What other unknowns in sol? the only thing missing as i know was Body21 all Body IDs are used.

So i have this
SPOILER

I can check if there is something beyond 46

EDIT: why i have not done it in SOL everywere eles i looked past the highest ID
"StarSystem":"Sol", "SystemAddress":10477373803, "Body":"Daedalus", "BodyID":47, "BodyType":"Station" }
thats the first time i see a Station whit an ID like that.

When you honk Sol, it says "46 bodies found".
In the logs:

JSON:
{ "timestamp":"2021-11-05T17:11:48Z", "event":"FSSDiscoveryScan", "Progress":1.000000, "BodyCount":40, "NonBodyCount":51, "SystemName":"Sol", "SystemAddress":10477373803 }

40 Bodies in Sol
The 6 missing from 46 to 40 are:
Asteroid Belt (BodyID 6)
Jupiter Halo Ring (BodyID 8)
D Ring (BodyID 14)
Halley's Comet (BodyID 21)
ZetaCC Ring (BodyID 22)
Galle Ring (BodyID 29)

Now "What other unknowns in sol?" either he speaks about the six above or the "NonBodyCount" (51 of them).

Sol has
14 tourist beacons
1 Asteroid Belt (no cluster)
4 Rings
1 "SmallBody": Halley's Comet

=> So 20 out of 51 NonBodies.
=> 31 Unknown "NonBodies"

I'm in deep space for now so i don't know what are the signals in Sol (installations, etc), i just remember there are 2 or 3 ancient probes + "voyager" tourist beacon (already counted).
