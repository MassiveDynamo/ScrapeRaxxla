Thank you very much!

And YES, if fdev can fix it, DONT TELL THEM .
While you can still do this, can you figure out Isinor pls ? It has strange logs (or lot of comets):

SPOILER: ISINOR

This time i found the code beacon, it will be more clear.
I edit the previous post for Sol And Pi Andromedae as they are hard to read without json code beacon.
