To unlock raxxla, you need to visit every permit locked system (not region), as these are all connected with elite history. some are inaccessible at the moment, so there must be a trick to unlocking. When there Ally with relevant factions such as the dark wheel, elite division. Etc
Then I imagine missions will appear as part of a hunt for raxxla, also I think people have followed dark wheel ships using wake scanners. That also leads you to Raxxla, via beagle point. As Raxxla was found using a cobra with 7ly drive. Yoi need to match this ship and call yourself Jameson.
Once you get there, its pretty cool, 10% discount off all old world ships. Enjoy
