The following to me suggest a series of tunnels - dare I say wormhole tunnels, the fuel quirium could be what kept the wormhole open and save to use.

Faraway Jump (Type 0), Circa 2800 Edit
The first commercially available hyperspace system was known as the Faraway Jump. The Faraway system was far from perfect, however, depending on a complex network of monitoring satellites, branch lines, stop points and rescue stations – which took hundreds of years to establish – to operate smoothly.

If it was a series of wormhole tunnels, then that would mean that they travelled alot further is a shorter time and might not be around the core worlds, beside if it was anywhere around the core worlds it would have been discovered by now due to all the exploring around the area.
