I think its in the core, some tiny poi floating +500,000 Ls by itself, would be impossible to find, unless you had a key. Finding voyager was bad enough. Something like that.
If it has been in the game from the start, then will be just a floating sidewinder.

then we will need to find the key somehow or do like in the old days, pick a direction and head out to see what you can find - the unknown is always worth finding.
