Just posting the following from TDW for reference:

"Rafe chuckled and shook his head. 'You see, that's the big question. Your father was chasing the
mythical plant Raxxla. Does it exist, or does it not? If it does, then on Raxxla there's an alien
construct that's a gateway to other Universes, and all that's in those Universes in the way of bounty,
and treasures, and aliens, and life . . .

'Jason Ryder was convinced that Raxxla existed. That's why he trained for, and became a part of,
the Dark Wheel, the legend-seekers. I hadn't heard much from him or about him for some time until
just before he died, when he told me he'd found evidence for the real existence of Raxxla. He came back from
Deep Space to get a proper team together . . . ' Rafe smiled bitterly. 'But just before he was due to
go back, he decided to take a safe-worlds holiday jaunt with his son . . . and an assassin was waiting
for him.' "
