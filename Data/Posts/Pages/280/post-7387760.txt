It depends on who is the mother of galaxies.

For Milky Way, the mother appears to be Hera, with Milky Way being created from her milk. But Mother of the Galaxy may not be the same as Mother of Galaxies, and the problem is that it's unknown whether or not the Greeks even knew of the existence of more than one galaxy. In any case, you're possibly looking at Hera's crown or jewel or pendant.

Otherwise, if you're looking for literally, non-myth, possibly the SagA* black hole may be it, if it has a role in holding the galaxy together and causing stars to form within it. Can look at theories of galaxy formation.
