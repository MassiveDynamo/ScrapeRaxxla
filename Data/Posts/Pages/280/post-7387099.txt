thats realy interesting. in english also Moon. Hmmpff
so i must be wrong because it's a translation mistake.

here is the litle fragment text in german

...dass die ursprÃ¼ngliche Gruppe ihre Basis an Bord eine verlassenen Sternenhafens hatte, der um den achten Planeten eines namenlosen Gasriesen kreist.

what i can see too is, "eine" its not correct, it must be sounds like "eines". because "Sternenhafens" has the "s" at the end.

thx for the answer
