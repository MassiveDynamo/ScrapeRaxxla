Just a tiny note on interpreting accents in the old lore on the web - these are all OCR'ed scans of the original paper - they contain hundreds of mis-scans, including accents and other artefacts including miss-spellings - I wouldn't waste your time..

Seems to me that the new clue of the toast in the codex is our fattest hint, and yet we have not one coherent story for each aspect of that toast.. we must be looking at it from the wrong angle..
