I still think there is something to be said for Lyras Song, when you look at the image for Raxxla on the codex it's a question mark over the galaxy map, there are a number of bright systems shown and the borders of two neighboring regions. Now is it just me or does the most prominent area of those two connecting borders match up with the Lyras Song region?

Posting from mobile at work so I can't include the image, I'll be looking at this more tonight
