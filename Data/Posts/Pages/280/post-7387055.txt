Quotation: If you believe the legend, only the bravest and most capable pilots of every generation will receive the honor of being invited to join the group. However, it makes no sense to search for Dark Wheel on your own.

I don't mind a triple elite requirement, but I really hope the above does not mean that a single pilot cannot find Raxxla on their own, in some lame attempt to encourage multiplayer, because that would suck.

I also hope it does not.mean you have to be elite in CQC or whatever it is called this week, because that would just be rude, and silly.
