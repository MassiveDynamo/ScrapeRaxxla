Let's throw an excerpt from the Dark Wheel Codex into the room.

Quotation: If you believe the legend, only the bravest and most capable pilots of every generation will receive the honor of being invited to join the group. However, it makes no sense to search for Dark Wheel on your own.

So my thesis is still that you can not get along without the combat rage "Elite" in the case of Dark Wheel and Raxxla.
