The Horizon's main menu image looks like a composite. If it was a real place the moons would need to be practically on top of each other or have a massive radius (Which is precluded by the massive ridges). The station in the images does admittedly look like an orbis gone dark.

Alexium67's idea of try to match the galactic plane seem like the more promising option. I

There is a system near Sol, CM Draconis, that has a special system description, a white star, but no planets. The system description mentions it being populated ( albeit a low population anarchy with an economy) so that seems kinda strange.

Something wierd about CM Draconis that I just noticed, after reading your post I looked the system up in the game, I had not yet been to the system and in the galaxy map under CM Draconis it read "No system Description is available", however after travelling to the system and scanning it the description now reads " Poor, low population extraction economy (anarchy)".
Very strange, does this mean systems without any description can change after being scanned? or is this a bug?
