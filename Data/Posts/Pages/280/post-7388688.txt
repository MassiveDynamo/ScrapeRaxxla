If gravity is the mother, may it be visible? How? By a superclusters? Where are this things placed on the our sky? On the our game sky? I hope you can understand what I want to say.

there’s a supercluster as one of the sights to see on the DW2 expedition, near Owen Mining base. Around PW2010 210 sort of area.

not fully convinced by the “English language thing” and “mother of galaxies”, and I’m an Englishman. You might say that black holes in general might be mothers of galaxies if they are actually white holes and generate said multiple galaxies. I tend to be a bit pedantic and would say either galactic mother for one galaxy, or mother of galaxies if she had produced one or more.

hence I would suggest the mythology clue might need to be re-examined. If I remember correctly Cassiopeia produced Andromeda which is one galaxy, but did she produce any other offspring which have been used to name other galaxies?

just a thought!
