Ive already said it in the canonn discord but i dont believe the start screen menu is a real place in game because no matter how you place yourself, as long as the constalation is more or less correct you will allways have barnards loop in your picture.



The second picture is made around 150ly from sol in direction barnards loop. The only other way that the constelation would match with the start screen would be if you look at barnards from the "opposite site" so you would fly to barnards loop and them some 150-250 ly further in this direction but you would have the same problem that barnards loop is in the picture.
I dont think its a real playce in game. Or would it be possible for FD to "remove" barnards loop for the start screen so its not totaly obvious where it is?

Is it possible that the reason Barnard's Loop isn't visible in this image is due to the shot being taken too close to the star? A lot of dimmer stars/deep sky objects are pretty dim or washed out when viewed close to a bright star, not becoming more visible until several dozen LS out.
