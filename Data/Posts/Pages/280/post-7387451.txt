Here's what I am working on...

Using the method mentioned a few pages back that suggest looking at the Toast to Raxxla as a map and putting adding 'Go' as the first word you get something along the lines of 'Go to the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies, To the whisperer in witch space, the siren of the deepest void. The parents' grief, the lovers' woe and the yearning of our vagabond hearts, to Raxxla'

Using this I took the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies as a reference but to what area of the galaxy I don't yet know, the only thing that came to mind straight away was the minor faction, Mother Gaia but this theory will need some work.

The next part that stood out to me was the siren of the deepest void. Looking at the galaxy map on the codex there are two regions that seem to relate to this, Lyras Song and The Void.

Starting with Lyras Song, the Greek meaning of Lyra is Lyrical, a direct connection to song and therefore sirens as mentioned in the toast.

Lyras Song according to the codex reports contains 8 gas giants, these are a Water Giant, Gas Giant with Water Based Life, Gas Giant with Ammonia-Based Life, Class 1 GG, Class 2 GG, Class 3 GG, Class 4 GG, and a Class 5 GG

There are 18 planets in the region, one Earth Type, 1 Ammonia, 2 Water PLanets, 1 Metal Rich, 2 High MEtal, 2 Rocky NA's, 1 Rocky Ice, 1 Ice NA, 1 Metal Rich with Atmos, 2 High Metals, 2 Rocky with Atmos, 1 Rocky Ice with Atmos and 1 Ice Planet with Atmos


Now looking at the codex reports for The Void

Eight Gas Giants again, these are, 1 Water Giant, 1 GG with Water Based Life, 1 GG with Ammonia-Based Life, Class 1, Class 2, Class 3, Class 4 and a Class 5

Eighteen reported planets that are 1 Earth Type, 1 Ammonia, 2 Water Worlds, 1 Metal Rich NA, 2 High Metal NA, 2 Rocky NA, 1 Rocky Ice NA, 1 Ice NA, 1 Metal Rich with Atmos, 2 High Metal with Atmos, 2 Rocky with Atmos, 1 Rocky Ice with Atmos and 1 Ice Planet with Atmos


I am still trying to find a connection (if any) to the last two lines, The parents grief, the lovers woe and the yearning of our vagabond hearts - if anyone has any ideas on this??

Hopefully, this hasn't already been looked into, I haven't read every single post in this mega thread [big grin]
