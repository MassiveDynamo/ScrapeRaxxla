Looks like that Merope map, such as seen from the probes
Good spot...But UA showed Merope, but this is the UP side and can’t find any references to the UP system being named from the spectral analysis...

on my phone at the moment so attaching a crappy image from an old Obsidian Ant vid, but the left system is merope... right system would be my picture...

Did some googling earlier and can’t find any sign of which system it is...

Did it stop with people assuming it’sCol 70 Sector FY-N C21-3?
