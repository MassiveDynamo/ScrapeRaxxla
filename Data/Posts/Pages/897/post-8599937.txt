Well alllllllllrighty then.
I need to finish engineering my pve ship soon, then jump in my explorer ship and physically participate.
Many think Raxxla is in Sol.
I have serious doubts. Sol has been discovered.
But #7 is definitely some kind of code. I've see it before in the plethora of research available.
