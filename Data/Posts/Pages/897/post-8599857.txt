Good spot...But UA showed Merope, but this is the UP side and can’t find any references to the UP system being named from the spectral analysis...

on my phone at the moment so attaching a crappy image from an old Obsidian Ant vid, but the left system is merope... right system would be my picture...

Did some googling earlier and can’t find any sign of which system it is...View attachment 181387
I think that's the permit-locked Col 70 Sector system, the one on the right. But that's been in stasis for a long time now.
