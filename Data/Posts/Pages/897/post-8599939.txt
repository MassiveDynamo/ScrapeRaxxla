I found the map very interesting!
Maybe if "WE" orginzed our thoughts and tried to identify what what we're seeing, just might reveal clues or even answers; or maybe it's just a dead horse. We know which is Me

1 = UA
2 = US
3 = Sag-A??
4 = Direction the Tharg items point
5 = UP
6 = Col 70 Sector FY-N C21-3
7 = coordinates to somewhere (Raxxla?)
8 = Thargoids go this way
9 = Raxxla or something else interesting!

Youâ€™ve missed the system on the left which is Merope!

hope that helps!
