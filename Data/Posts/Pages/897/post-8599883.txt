It maybe space madness kicking in or the wine or the tinfoil hat may have slipped a little... but I was thinking what are the big mysteries/stories in Elite... Raxxla (of course), Guardians and the Thargs... then I was thinking what do they have in common in the new lore (I’m old skool 8 bit Elite). So humans fought the Thargoids, Guardians fought the Thargoids. We don’t know why the Thargoids got upset with humans first time around and we have no idea why Guardians fought the Thargoids (correct me if I am wrong - always keen to learn more!). We do know Raxxla was found (well probably!) and we know possibly the Dark Wheel found something out too. There’s Soontil Artifacts which are also Alien but not from Guardian/Thargoid/Human sources.... So do the Thargoids know about Raxxla? Did the Guardians also discover it? and are the Thargs protecting it? If so is that a map to Raxxla? Just a thought...
Also noticed I may have missed a ringed planet on my simplistic diagram if this one is accurate...

if the bottom is Sag-A (Tharg machines show a spiralling galaxy of some sort when you use the UA, UP and US as in the diagram?) then what is the destination? Home?

The 8 leaved icons = Thargoids? And the - and | in the middle are the coordinations to get there?

There will be no clues, but you have to make it a little bit obvious....

Has anyone taken a UA to Merope and see if it points to a different direction as the diagram would suggest? Does a US point somewhere? And if the UP needs to go to Col 70 Sector FY-N C21-3 we’re a bit screwed!)

And with that brain dump and the end of the glass of wine it’s time for sleep
