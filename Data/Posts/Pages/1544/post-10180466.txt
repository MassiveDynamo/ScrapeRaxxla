I agree. Its also worth noting that Drew Wagar recently admitted on his discord that he thinks the whole idea of Raxxla was removed as far back as 2017 by Braben, much to the discontent of Michael Brookes, who was then moved off Elite and onto another project not related to Elite. This was around the same time TDW missions were removed, and when some Elite lore was retconned. Basically anything that can't trace its origins directly to DB, was retconned out of Elite.

The whole thing is just a wild goose chase now as there's no longer anything to find and no story to tell, but its still used as a marketing tool, and likely the reason why DB and Frontier will never admit that it only exists in Holdtock's novella, and as a brief write up in the Codex.
Drew, while being an awesome dude, is not the authority on what is implemented in game. Fdev, as in David Braben was bemused that people hadn't found it in the beta. There is likely no narrative around it. It is a puzzle hunt.

How do I know it is in the game? https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-10179795
