I was paraphrasing what he wrote, but he's obviously making reference to the lore in the books that was later retconned (egs. Oresrians, Thargoid Civil War, and Halsey's visions), but if you want to know the specifics and the context of what he's referring to, take a little time to go read what he wrote on his discord on 07/07/23.
Actually, pretty sure "Thargoids" are the Traditionalist-branch Guardians which would nicely explain HIP 22460 and Proteus Wave was turned so spectacularly against humanity. Besides, read the Guardian codex about the fighting during the civil wars - in which the Traditionalist branch are noted for enzymatic weapons. The could control Guardian technology because they are Guardian. Thargoid is just the human name for the species and this is covered in "First Thargoid Contact" in Lave. The name originated from symbols appearing to spell THARG on the hull in the made for holo-vid video. This is also potentially the violent reaction between the two groups technology - in which "Thargoid" technology reacts violently to Guardian or Progressive-branch technology. Also, in the "Thargoid" codex they seed a region and leave (but possibly left behind some folks). A few centuries later there are Guardians. There is a very simple explanation - they are derived from the same species but one group developed high technology that was not organic (which became the basis of our ships). One needs only look at the Saud Kruger Astrogation Console and its holographic technology (and Holo-Me) to start seeing it. So, yes our technology is "Thargoid" derived but it happened almost 1,300 years ago at Sol. There is also a very curious mention of genetics in the Ram Tah logs.
