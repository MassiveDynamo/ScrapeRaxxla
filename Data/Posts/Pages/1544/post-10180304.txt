I was paraphrasing what he wrote, but he's obviously making reference to the lore in the books that was later retconned (egs. Oresrians, Thargoid Civil War, and Halsey's visions), but if you want to know the specifics and the context of what he's referring to, take a little time to go read what he wrote on his discord on 07/07/23.
Do you have the link to that discord?
