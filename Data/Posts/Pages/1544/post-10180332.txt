I realize that. It was more historical context to explain how the current state of affairs happened as well as the Guardian Civil Wars. Humanity has already shown early signs of splintering in the same fashion. If we are not careful, it will destroy us, too. You cannot forget the past. The past is the lesson that teaches us about the present. The past, though, is not destiny or fate. The present can be changed in light of those lessons. Humanity's path to the stars and its' connection to Raxxla puts us solidly in the crosshairs of Guardian Civil AI. We are on the road to extinction at present. That threat only got worse with Caleb "Salvation" Wycherley and the Nemesis Fail-safe Device.

That said, once you learn something you have some level of responsibility for those lessons. Let's just say some of what happened in the past, may have been meant to ensure that only those who could be responsible would find it. With great power comes even greater responsibility.

To quote Lucifer Morningstar from The Sandman:

Tools are the subtlest of traps. We become reliant upon them and in their absence we are vulnerable, weak, defenseless.

-Lucifer Morningstar said to Morpheus (aka "Dream")
