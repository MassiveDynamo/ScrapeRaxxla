Gestalt psychology is all about perception. This is being mentioned because it figures prominently in the first page of "Alien World: A Complete Illustrated Guide" which first features Raxxla and the Oisir-Raxxlans.

The core ideas behind Gestalt psychology are:

- "atomism," also known as "elementalism,": 3  the view that all knowledge, even complex abstract ideas, is built from simple, elementary constituents

- "sensationalism," the view that the simplest constituents—the atoms of thought—are elementary sense impressions

- "associationism," the view that more complex ideas arise from the association of simpler ideas

The adage "the whole is more than the sum of its parts," relates to how things are perceived. This is partly why I suspect Raxxla is very much in-game and told through environmental storytelling whereby places, names, iconography, and even accents on voice logs is important to understanding the story. This would even include small details such as Lavian Brandy is brewed in oak barrels imported from Earth.

Read everything. The descriptions on everything are there to help you see the big picture.

I will have to get a scan of the first page of "Alien World": A Complete Illustrated Guide" in a bit.
