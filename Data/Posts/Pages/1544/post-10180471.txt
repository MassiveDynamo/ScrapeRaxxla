Just so you know: Elite's Universe very much utilizes Ancient Aliens as a core part of the greatly expanded lore that constitutes a large portion of the Raxxla myth. You'll notice the Qa'Qal'Orq Gestalt Mind visited Earth in the form of "the Human God of Turin" (in otherwords the Turin Shroud is an alien artifact) in the fictional universe that constitutes Raxxla. This was hardly the first time such an event happens according to the lore from Robert Holdstock. I hope as time goes on we get many more types of aliens.
