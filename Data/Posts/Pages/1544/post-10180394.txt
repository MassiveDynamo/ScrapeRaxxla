I still think Raxxla is in the game. The codex entry came long after the much exaggerated retcon.
(The only thing that was changed was that the Thargoid/Alinance diplomacy in the 3250s, was removed from history).
That said, I am not convinced at all that is legitimately gone. The whole of the California Nebula region and Turner Research Group strongly suggests that not is as it seems. This doesn't even get into the weirdness that there are Thargoids in the first game but using clues such as in-service dates of ships and the fact Lave was a dictatorship suggests that something about the past isn't entirely as it seems. Walden comes to power AFTER the "First Thargoid War" in August 3174. The "Thargoids" should have vanished in 3151. I also do not believe Sohalian Fever was retconned based on GalNet and events of Cereberus Plague.
