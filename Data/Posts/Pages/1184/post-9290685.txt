Ya I think Sol is important but I would hate it if Raxxla was actually there. I think the key that got humanity looking for Raxxla was likely in Sol. Both the Mars Artefact as well as the permit locked Triton seem to make sense as being connected. Im still following what i think are generalized Holdstockian themes... He had alien ruins on Pluto .... but Im guessing FD has put them on Triton. Neptune and Oberon - Neptune being the Brother that chose to follow Raxxla... I also like Triton because of his prominence in MBs fancy tattoo. I like to think that both Thargoids and Guardians had some influence on early Earth.. i suspect there is a correlation between Thargoids and the earlier Old Gods... the Cthonic... Earth Mother etc... and the Guardians with the later Sky Gods ... but ya who knows. Im still playing with the idea that Tornquist (and the idea of Raxxla) is related to Holdstocks ideas around Thorn.. the Ragthorn.... Earth and Stone - and possibly related to things like the Thargoid structures... I suspect part of the emphasis on exo-biology we are getting... But ya thats all conjecture. Currently on a 23rdian quest to invert the pyramid though.... wish me luck
Yep, I went searching at Pluto (and L4+L5) for the Holdstock ruins but found nothing there. But then, it was not inserted in-game until well after release so I am dubious of any relationship to Raxxla.
