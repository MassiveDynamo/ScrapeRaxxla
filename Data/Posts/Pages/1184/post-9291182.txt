Darn it, you’re correct! My memory is playing tricks on me. Was thinking that it was added in The Guardians 2.2 update 25Oct2016, but that added Persephone (Planet Nine), Haumea, Makemake, Eris, Orcus, 2002 MS4, Salacia, Quaoar, 2007 OR10 and Sedna to Sol. So Pluto has been in-game from the outset. It therefore might be a candidate for Raxxla searching, but the hexagonal convection patterns weren’t observed until New Horizons got there in 2016 which puts that hexagonality candidate out of the picture! I’m thinking Saturn or Neptune, & leaning towards the first but permit-locked Triton is an interesting possibility. But the Jupiter link to 2001 Space Odyssey is also very interesting - it is an odyssey after all, and MB’s “it’s a personal journey we all must make” could be read as an odyssey!!! I’m convinced we’ve had significant clues for years!
In the book version of 2001, the Monolith is on Iapeatus, a moon of Saturn, rather than Jupiter, so if Raxxla is a 2001 reference, it might be round Saturn.
