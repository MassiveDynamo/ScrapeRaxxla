For folly and japes, I am now inclined to quote Philip Sidney in every post I respond towards Frontier Development.
I could get behind that myself! So next time I want to express my anger and frustrations about the game, I will just say:

I sought fit words to paint the blackest face of woe:
Studying inventions fine, her wits to entertain,
Oft turning others' leaves, to see if thence would flow
Some fresh and fruitful showers upon my sun-burnt brain.

Sure is more fun to read than most of the rage posts recently.
