I have put the Raxxla search on a lower priority for now until there is another official and clear FDev statement that it can be found currently. Because right now, with the Codex entry being the only real clue -if it is one-, anything outside of the game shouldn't be needed to solve this, so there really isn't much to go by. The alleged toast and all the other hints in the entry are just too open to interpretation, and I think it all comes back to the central issue of this search: we don't even know what we are looking for. We don't have the key to apply to the clues that generates something making sense. So... wait and see, for now. Still, I don't feel like we wasted our time here. It got us out exploring, after all. And at least for me, it has been a fun exercise so far in puzzle solving and engaging in the exploration aspect of the game
