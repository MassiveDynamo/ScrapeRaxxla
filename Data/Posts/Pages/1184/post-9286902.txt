There are some interesting parallels with 2001 Space Odyssey (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolith_(Space_Odyssey)). In the film the monolith that was a transportation gateway was orbiting Jupiter (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(film)), was DB a fan of the film? I think he is of Arthur C Clarke who wrote it.
Have you ever used a docking computer in ED or Elite?
