I was just chatting with Mick about this and I figured I'd put it up here and watch the boos and dismissals roll in... What if Raxxla is just the embodiment of FDEV's desire for everyone to explore the galaxy and there's some cryptocurrency tied into Elite Dangerous' galactic exploration discovery statistics...

What if the place we all believe to be Raxxla is actually in our hearts and minds and the mystical secret is that our lives are our own and FDEV believes that its deepest and most cherished privilege is being the group that produced a galaxy in which we all spend that short time we have on this planet of ours?

What if its just a reference to that Bill Hicks joke

Of course... There's also a straight line going from the cluster of stars near Barnard's Loop, that goes straight through Witch Head Nebula, over to Siren in Alliance space, and then my trail goes cold but there's something about the grief of parents, woe of lovers, and the human drives of a nomadic species... so... There's that...
