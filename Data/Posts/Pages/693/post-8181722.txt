My take on “Cora” is slightly different but I believe there is indeed a journey to be had here. I’ve researched countless topics over the past few weeks that I’ve been looking in earnest into this mystery. I can say that, were it not for Raxxla, I’d have never looked into those topics. From Garden Cities, to random scientists, pioneers, and countless mythologies.
I’m enjoying the journey thus far and if I can retain it all, I’d say I’ve learned a lot.

So back to Cora; I think Cora relates to an indigenous group of people in Mexico, named the Cora.

They meshed the beliefs of the Spanish conquerors into their pagan beliefs and created the own brand of Christianity.
One of their Chief Dieties was named Tayau the sun God who also went by the shortened name Tau (like Tau Ceti). Tau would traverse the sky until he sat in his throne at noon.
I believe that’s what we’re supposed to gather from Cora and Tau Ceti in this instance. A sun like deity, that moves on a set path and schedule and “sits down” periodically so to speak.

Art Tornqvist on the other hand...I believe is a reference to the Tornqvist index; an economics index that is calculated for consecutive periods.

Im no statistics professor so I can’t say for certain what the specifics are but I think the gist of the clue there is to use Art (Winking Cat) to find out time frames or periods.

Economy may also be a factor as well. The Raxxla logo is green similar to the vision for Garden Cities. Could Raxxla be moving to systems that are only Agricultural?

Do we have regions identified as “green belts” in the bubble?
