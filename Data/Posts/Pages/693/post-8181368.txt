Had a thought. This pic comes from a video from FDev talking about the future of elite. They showed this screen during a hyperspace jump, and they were quite careful not to show the location they were jumping to. The curious thing is that it’s not a system that is targeted for the jump, it’s a planet. Try as I may and others have too, I can’t seem to come up with a sequence of actions that would leave an image of a planet in the targeting holo whole jumping. So, I thought recently, what if that’s a hint to Raxxla? What if Raxxla is its own system? Idk how the stellar forge works in this regaurd or if it’s possible within it to make a system that is just one planet with no star etc, but when jumping we land at the most massive star in a system. What if it’s not the most massive star but simply the most massive object? But the upper and lower limits of star and planet size just make it so the most massive object is always a star I generated systems? That would allow them to tailor make a system that’s just a planet. Wouldn’t be called Raxxla of course. Why would it? It’s unknown to stellar cartography. Wouldn’t change the name to Raxxla until it was found and it’s secret discovered confirming its identity. Then nobody on staff would know where it is since it’s not called Raxxla, wouldn’t need a special skin, it’s a planet containing a special thing, the planet itself is probably quite ordinary. There would only need be maybe a couple people to design and plant it’s alien artifact and one person who’s got access to the game to plant the single planet system.
