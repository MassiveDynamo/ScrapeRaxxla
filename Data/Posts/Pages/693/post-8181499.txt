They talked about it being weird and all and how would you jump to a planet etc in the discussion from what I remember but I don’t recall anyone thinking that perhaps the planet is the system itself. Unless I’m quasi remembering it and thinking it’s an original idea as a result which has been known to happen either way i think it’s an intriguing possibility.
