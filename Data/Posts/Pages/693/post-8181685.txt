It's a journey (Prove me wrong). Not in some stupid general sense. For a person to Prove their journey to be real, there must be something to show the world.
Cora needed a ride in Art's ship to find the pirate treasure. Cora, the creative Life giving force. Art, a ship based mechanic. A game mechanic, as in the camera suite.
It has seemed to me, for a long time now, that they want You All to embrace your creative self, because there is life in that. Much more life than there is for you to just sitting at your desk for years on end going on some make believe quest for nothing.
A creative transformation, to Prove you did what you did.

Edit* As far back as initiations go in the history of the world they all pretty much served the same purpose, to change child to adult through the metaphorical death of the child, or immature mind. I'm sure most of us at this point are familiar with the term Kidult. A child in a grown ups body. Children play with toys all day long. Grown ups are not designed nor supposed to be doing that. If you find that you're supposed to be leading life as a grown up, and instead play games all day, you are in fact a kidult and need to address that. Incorporating Art into that is a fix and a chance to turn a kids game into something a grown up can grow from. At least you won't just be playing games, but rather will be doing something creative and somewhat introspective in that process.

"Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way.
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way."
-Pink Floyd, Time.
