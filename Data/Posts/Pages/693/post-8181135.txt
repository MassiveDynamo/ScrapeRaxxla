Sounds to me like a description of the Raxxla logo:
60 degee angles.
Two circles by Rembrandt. One complete and one incomplete in the logo.
Guernica with triangles an a central ligth source (Sun).
Three streets
Six outer garden cities.
Could be. Also Galileo attempted to solve the circles problem by using hexagons. He noticed that the smaller hexagon made “jumps through space” to keep up with the larger hexagon it was attached to. Saying that the smaller object made jumps leaving voids, and he felt that explained how two rotating (and spiraling points) or different diameters could cover the same horizontal distance in a single rotation. He was ultimately incorrect when it comes to circles, but it’s interesting nonetheless I think.
