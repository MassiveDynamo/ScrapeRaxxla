Guys but you missed my question, did you try tos tream by vnc/rdp or whatever are sharing desktop clients?
If it is too slow or anything else wrong, maybe i should save own time trying to repeat.
Thought you asked about VR and Google Cardboard? Don’t know anything about streaming, but there is/usd to be a couple of forum threads on VR & would be surprised if someone hasn’t tried Cardboard...
