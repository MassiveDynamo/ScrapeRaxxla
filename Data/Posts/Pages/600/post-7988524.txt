It’s kind of a truism though. Belief is inherently a matter of thinking something without sufficient evidence, disregarding uncertainty and sometimes ignoring contra-evidence. Otherwise it’s not a belief.

Also, it’s a slightly esoteric and OT discussion, but I’d personally say that ‘lies’ ascribes a level of intent which is often not there.

Following on from that, a philosophical point for general consideration; ‘lies’ is a term which is well into the realms of absolutism. Absolutism is itself a belief and therefore subject to the same principle. Is the concept of a lie therefore itself 50% or more a lie?

(Sorry for the OT folks, I just enjoy an abstract philosophical discussion once in a while! )
