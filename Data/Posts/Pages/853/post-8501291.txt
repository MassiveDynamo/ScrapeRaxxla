It will be interesting to see what happens with that initiative, but playing that sort of BGS machinations needs a lot of players and I cant help but think that recruitment to TDW should be feasible by a single player. And I suspect (although the Codex seems to link them), that finding Raxxla is not dependent on recruitment to TDW (who apparently may not know Raxxlaâ€™s location).
It all adds interest to the possibilities...
