I guess her fate is pretty clear. Drew is quoted in the linked article and he confirmed it once again in a recent stream. Do you have any hint, that she is not dead?

No I dont, I did say "I believe", meaning based on my off-the-top-of-my-head knowledge.......

You are correct, my apologies, not sure how i didnt know this already...

She was killed on April 29, 3303 by CMDR Besieger[1] in the Anumclaw system, while she was traveling from 46 Eridani to Teorge to deliver a vital message.[2] Her allies Raan Corsen, Tsu Annabelle Singh, and Yuri Nakamura survived, however, and while Kahina's (CMDR Salome) message had been lost, they succeeded in bringing evidence of the conspiracy to light.

But with her crew surviving, again, there is possibility that they have somthing to do with future story/content unlocking.... all-be-it, unlikely due to the age of her death now, but for some reason I could swear I had a recent msg or mission or somthing, back in Jan or Feb, that mentioned Salome... I must be going nutz....
