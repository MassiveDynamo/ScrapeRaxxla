... and the fact TDW influence never allows expansion....
We will know shortly. We have been increasing INF in LFT 926 of TDW rapidly in the past few days. https://elitebgs.app/faction/59e7a599d22c775be0fe08df
CMDR Kai Zen started the "Turning The Wheel" community event: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/turning-the-wheel.546088/ . We first attempted increasing INF in ShinDez but with the traffic there, it was progressing too slowly and we just recently switched focus to LFT 926. Seems to be working. Once we hit the 75% expansion trigger we will know if it is possible. It may only be locked from expanding out of ShinDez but not LFT 926.
