And PowerPlay is a very poor substitute! It holds zero interest for me.
But we’ve been telling FD this for years and they’ve made no moves to inject storylines. Its a great shame.
The game is beautiful, but empty. It’s only Raxxla and TDW Questing that keep me going.

Edit: but I still play most days! However I do miss Michael Brookes’ involvement. We did have a storyline (or at least the feel of one ) when he was around.
I have no interest in Power Play either, but that would change if my little theory was ever proved correct....thinking of game mechanics, and the fact TDW influence never allows expansion....

TDW invite opens up a "hidden power" in Power Play, where you can help TDW flourish and ultimately find Raxxla :-D
