I guess her fate is pretty clear. Drew is quoted in the linked article and he confirmed it once again in a recent stream. Do you have any hint, that she is not dead?
Dead or not...her (Salome's) story is a bit compelling and adds something to the game. Personally, I believe she is indeed dead. Doesn't mean her story still can't unfold and even add to the game. I'm looking forward to it. My 2 cents.
