I'm new here...so please forgive if this has already been covered. What lore eludes to the DARK WHEEL being in a brown dwarf system? I haven'r run across that one yet. Thanks!

The picture shown in the Codex entry on TDW shows a station orbiting a planet and a star. Some people think that star is a brown dwarf in-game (doesn't look like one to me). Also the entry quotes Lyta Crane a “journalist” who is supposed to know something about TDW. Her name is an anagram of LYT ARCANE, and LYT are all non-scoopable star types in-game. However the same article throws doubt onto her supposed knowledge and implies she may make things up for her paying audience so could be misinformation.

Much of the previous lore for ED we had from books etc has been retconned by FD, but we don’t have an official statement about what is still valid, so the only lore we can believe is in the Codex. And as previously mentioned some of that may be deliberate disinformation!
