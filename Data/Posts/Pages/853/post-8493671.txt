This has nothing to do with anything but I just had to share.

I was in Shinny D the other night running mission to up TDW's influence for the Moving the Wheel thingy. I was chasing some baddy and I got the message that he had just left the system but to go to this other system and a contact would meet me. I jump over there and throttle down. A few seconds later, she jumps into the system and tells me to drop in on her wake...and then proceeds to fly directly into the center of the star and drop out of supercruise. Low wake icon was literally in the center of the star. Hilarious!

I had one of those from another faction. She dropped out of SC a few ls from the star to pass the information across, it was quite toasty!
