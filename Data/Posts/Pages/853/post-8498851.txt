I just hope it wasnt a "one time only event" I missed it by a couple months and there has been no real in-game story since. Sorry but interstellar initiatives dont count despite what was said, we had no way of influencing outcome. Witch Head was always going to get colonised, etc.

TDW and especially Raxxla need in game story IMHO

And PowerPlay is a very poor substitute! It holds zero interest for me.
But we’ve been telling FD this for years and they’ve made no moves to inject storylines. Its a great shame.
The game is beautiful, but empty. It’s only Raxxla and TDW Questing that keep me going.

Edit: but I still play most days! However I do miss Michael Brookes’ involvement. We did have a storyline (or at least the feel of one ) when he was around.
