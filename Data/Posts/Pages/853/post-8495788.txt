Dead or not...her (Salome's) story is a bit compelling and adds something to the game. Personally, I believe she is indeed dead. Doesn't mean her story still can't unfold and even add to the game. I'm looking forward to it. My 2 cents.
I just hope it wasnt a "one time only event" I missed it by a couple months and there has been no real in-game story since. Sorry but interstellar initiatives dont count despite what was said, we had no way of influencing outcome. Witch Head was always going to get colonised, etc.

TDW and especially Raxxla need in game story IMHO
