She might not be directly associated with TDW or Raxxla, but whos to say for sure if we dont know her ultimate fate yet, I believe she is still considered "missing", no?
I guess her fate is pretty clear. Drew is quoted in the linked article and he confirmed it once again in a recent stream. Do you have any hint, that she is not dead?
