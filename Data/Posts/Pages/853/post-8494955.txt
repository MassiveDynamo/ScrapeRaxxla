it turns out there is a working way how to find a dark system, it needs to fly about a couple of hours inside the system and maybe the target of the dark system will appear?
I'm new here...so please forgive if this has already been covered. What lore eludes to the DARK WHEEL being in a brown dwarf system? I haven'r run across that one yet. Thanks!
