Salomé is Drew Wagar's character and he mentioned multiple times, that he does not know the location of Raxxla. Therefore I find it unlikely Salomè's actions in-game are a direct hint.

unlikely maybe, but there is more to Salome than you might be willing to realize...

if you read here:

SPOILER: DREW

They have apparent direct quotes from Drew on the subject of Salome and that what happens to her does or did affect the story, and they had "contingincy plans" in place if Salome and her crew were indeed killed... which means her life or death has meaning to in-game story line/content....

She might not be directly associated with TDW or Raxxla, but whos to say for sure if we dont know her ultimate fate yet, I believe she is still considered "missing", no?
