It's from an old video interview(pre release?). I don't remember exactly which one.
If Drew is still lurking, he may remember. I think the artefact was mentioned in authors guide, as well.

Edit: There is no mention of Raxxla, in connection with the artefact.

And some alien had to bring the Artefact to Sol to lose it on Mars, so...
I suspect it’s the remote control to recall their ship “Raxxla”
