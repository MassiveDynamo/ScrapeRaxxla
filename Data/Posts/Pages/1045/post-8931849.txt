In my opinion, the artifact is not related to Raxxla. The artifact is rather part of one unused quest for the community. Perhaps it needs time because this is an important detail for some transition of the ED world to another state. At the moment, it is clear that sooner or later the rules of the game will change, and we will face a new stage in the plot of the universe. But when and why? I think that the whole story with the Targoids brings us to this, as well as this artifact, which is like a gun on the wall - in the end it will shoot.
