I wouldnt trust the FE2 timeline, its been retconned too much to fit into the new narrative and new players to the game would have no access to it. Mind you, until we find the source of the 2250s date I have I wouldnt trust that either even though it fits in 'better' with ED history of human expansion and a few decades later they found the Relic as well, and less than 50 years later we have the first mention of Raxxla.

So ED timeline is Martian Fossils, Martian Relic and Raxxla all found or first mentioned within a 50 year timeline....Raxxla is mentioned in Tau Ceti but nothing says that was the source of the myth, it could lead back to Mars.

In both cases its described as Martian not Alien so implication is Mars had its own evolution which lived and died with the planet.....or its the start point of the Guardians and not an Outpost. Nothing says it wasnt Martian in origin, but what happened to them is unknown....maybe they moved to Earth when Mars started dying?
