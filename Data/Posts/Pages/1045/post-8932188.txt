I have:

2250s - Martian Fossils found on Mars (of what? No info given)

Brackets are my notes, unfortunately I didnt list the source. Has one of us got the now-retconned FE2 timeline or are there 2 dates kicking around? Whats the source for the 2100s. got a link?

Both plural I note, so more than one fossil.

RE DB saying it was important, in that timeframe its before we knew about Thargs or Guardians officially so may have been intended for one of them originally but doesnt fit the Guardian sites pattern does it, wrong Star type?
