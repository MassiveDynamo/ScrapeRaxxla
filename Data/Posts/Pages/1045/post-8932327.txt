The Martian Fossils are mentioned in the Galnet article about the Federation as well. FFE had a few "alien artifacts" I dont think all of them made it into ED. There was also the "Duval Artifact" - I think it was a statue made by the sentient race that was living on one of the Achenar planets. Also there was a burial capsule with two where they determined that one of the aliens went into it alive ? Ya dont have it in front of me at the moment... I think there is alot of references to older sci -fi stories in these and ED... something about bubble ships and "Oh non pas encore"...

Edit - I seem to remember a youtube that ED put out last year where they flew around sol and talked about things like the martian artefact as well as the fossils...

edit edit: I was just thinking about "Quaids Vision"... I think Phillip Ds(filthy morality police) version is Quails Vision... and it involved the earth being invaded by highly advanced rodents... Wonder where Douglas Adams got his idea from.... filthy mice
