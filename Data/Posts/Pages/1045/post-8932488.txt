Has anyone done much searching in the Aquilas Halo? That's where I'm going next.
Made a trip out that way last year... but was still flying my antiquated Asp (only had 45 or so ly jumprange)... need better jump ranges out that way - especially if you want to visit the Void as well. - good trip though lots of sights and dont forget to pick up a tee shirt before you leave
