The logo is just the station viewed from the front? That would tell us nothing, I prefer to think it's a map.

Unless of course the station is the Dark Wheel station and the start place for a map of how to find Raxxla.... or it might be the end of the "map" and you may be looking for a station that is Raxxla... who knows... (well apart from DB and MB) ;-)
