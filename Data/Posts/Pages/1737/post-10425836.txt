Doesn't need to be complete sets though does it. It seems incredibly likely to me that they reserved some names for future use. They could have even done that by just picking "cool" sounding names from a master list of all names they'd collected as possible uses across the entire game, what was left was used to rename the systems (or any other criteria).

I believe something as simple as that would result in basically what you're suggesting there in terms of the 'incomplete' sets.

Simple answer really. Most likely to be the case.
