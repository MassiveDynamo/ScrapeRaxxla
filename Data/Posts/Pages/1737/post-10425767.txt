An interesting aside

I was playing around with words and systems the other day, typing in characters say from Dante’s Comedy and found a whole bunch of systems called Francisco.

Sadly these don’t relate to the comedy nor that character but rather to: Francisco de Eliza, a Spanish navigator and explorer.

So what seems interesting about these is that of those I was able to find, all seem to be concentrated on one particular side of the bubble, in a kind of boundary.

When comparing this with various other aspects I’ve mapped, it looks to me they do seem to form a boundary area, I do wonder if that’s intentional, or it simply mirrors the shape of the general bubble. One layer I applied which fitted perfectly was the Thargoid Maelstroms, with one falling directly upon it.

In short considering their contextual history and in game location, I do suspect they are placed intentionally and do form some type of boundary area.

How interesting. In short I feel it supports other suspicions, namely that naming and placements of systems is not arbitrary.

Iberian navigators can be a nice fit to my New World theory: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-10424691

I know Fernão do Pó has plenty of stations named after him (they catch my attention because "do Pó" means "of Powder"); a brief search also found some by full name (Gaspar de Lemos, António de Andrade, Francisco de Almeida) and others by surname only (Elcano, Cabral, Vespucci, Cortés).

The criteria for picking names seems all over the place, but maybe not their positioning...
