I suspect that was the nearest FD could get in-game to the book's description of the Soontill system:
SPOILER: CHAPTER 20 EXTRACT









To be honest that just described a Thargoid Titan...........and we have Soontill in Elite which was an apparant Thargoid/Human system with an beacon hinting this, its quite possible that it is infact the real Soontill just missing the Titan it contained and that's described above, The only different key factor here is the purple color reference
