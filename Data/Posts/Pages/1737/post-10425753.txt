An interesting aside

I was playing around with words and systems the other day, typing in characters say from Dante’s Comedy and found a whole bunch of systems linked to the name Francisco.

Sadly these don’t relate to the comedy, that character, nor any system naming, but rather to stations all named after: Francisco de Eliza, a Spanish navigator and explorer.

So what seems interesting about these is that of those I was able to find, all seem to be concentrated on one particular side of the bubble, in a kind of boundary.

When comparing this with various other aspects I’ve mapped, it looks to me they do seem to form a boundary area, I do wonder if that’s intentional, or it simply mirrors the shape of the general bubble. One layer I applied which fitted perfectly was the Thargoid Maelstroms, with one falling directly upon it.

In short considering their contextual history and in game location, I do suspect they are placed intentionally and do form some type of boundary area.

How interesting. In short I feel it supports other suspicions, namely that naming and placements of systems is not arbitrary.
