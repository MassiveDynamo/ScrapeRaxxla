To be honest that just described a Thargoid Titan...........and we have Soontill in Elite which was an apparant Thargoid/Human system with an beacon hinting this, its quite possible that it is infact the real Soontill just missing the Titan it contained and that's described above, The only different key factor here is the purple color reference
That's a good point. Can't believe I didn't think about the Titan cloud maelstroms. A fist full of space rock.
They can just spawn one large enough to fit a small moon.
It would have to be a dead Titan husk though, otherwise it would be very much NOT dormant right now
