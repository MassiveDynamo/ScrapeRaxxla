Assume Fdev didn't sort the master list, then when Fdev copy/pasted that master list into the database that contains the system names, what you'd get a replication of that 'clumpy' data,
Containing, therefore, on the assumption that the list wasn't in anyway either shuffled before use or picked from at random, "full" sets of all but one, a partial set, and then possibly a bunch of sets entirely unused.

The "Greek Gods" set is certainly partial - Hephaestus was added later, of the other most famous deities Aphrodite, Hermes, Hestia and Dionysus are also missing.
But the "Hindu Pantheon" set is also partial - Saraswati and Rohini were added later, Vishnu, Lakshmi and Shiva are absent - while many others are present.
Similar omissions can be found in a lot of the other sets, too.

That doesn't suggest a pattern where the sets were just concatenated and used top-down until they ran out of systems needing to be renamed.

(Obviously this doesn't mean that the positioning of any particular named system is meaningful - but it does appear that they did at least shuffle the list before using it)

So effectively overwriting the procgen stellar forge names when a 'real' star name wasn't available.
And often also when it was - HIP 65026, or HIP 66238, have been overwritten with names from other sources. Even some lore-specific systems have hijacked real stars - HIP 7387 for example.
