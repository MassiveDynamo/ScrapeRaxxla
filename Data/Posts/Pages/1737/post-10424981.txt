While on the topic of stellar phenomena, has anyone attempted to triangulate an approximate position of Soontill based on the codex image?
I rotated it 180 and managed to replicate an approximation of the LMG position with camera zoom etc.
I wonder if the clouds are concealing the galactic background to disguise its position?
