To me, it's a simple photoshop. Dude knew enough to target the 7th planet then got it in his rear view, copied and pasted an icy body from some other screenshot, and then just lessened the opacity to make it appear "ghosted." Also probably just pulled the "8" in the body description from another screen shot as well.

Exactly. Immediately checked to see any visible faults around the number 8 and the planets shape.
Well, that planet looks like it took a punch from it's upper left side, if you look closely. More likely, it took a little "magic wand tool" accident. It's a bit too sharply cut
