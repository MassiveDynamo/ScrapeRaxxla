Maybe romilayu missed the 8th body. Or does it attribute him as the first scanner?

He didn't and it does.

The central star of the system shares the system name. So in a system "STAR", there may be seven planets to be named STAR1, STAR2, and so on until STAR7. There will be eight bodies, but seven planets and one star. There was no 8th planet in that system at the time of my arrival and exploration. While I suppose it is possible that something in-system has changed since then, I find it highly more probable that photoshop.
