Michael Brooks has said players have been through the system raxxla is in but hadnt scanned it, so random player passing by it not realizing what they were seeing, totally possible.
that being said, Raxxla being so far out, unlikely. human ships couldnt get that far when it was originally discovered, it has to be in the bubble.

Add this to my above post about an 8th planet. Maybe romilayu missed the 8th body. Or does it attribute him as the first scanner? someone said something like that too.. Someone should go check. 8)

Everyone could have a big party at raxxla just for fun in case it's not there. You could all sit at the supposed spot where the 8th planet should be and chill out.(pun intended. Cause space is cold if no planet exists to warm it.) And update the redit post with live pics and streams! ><

"We're all here at the live and exciting discovery of Raxxla!. This invisible planet behind is the long lost long sought after missng Raxxla!... etc etc."
