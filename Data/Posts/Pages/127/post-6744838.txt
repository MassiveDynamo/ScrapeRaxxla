I kinda like it, there's a picture and it looks like something I could believe. Also there's a system, and many will go there now and search for those mysterious signal sources. Also I'm a fan of low heat Diamondbacks. Of course I assume it's a hoax, but going there to prove it is as good reason for a long trip as any really.

Raxxla being hidden in a system name is a bit silly though. References to some ancient gnostic traditions, or deciphering thargoid language would serve the esoteric tradition of tinfoil and Raxxla hunting way better.
