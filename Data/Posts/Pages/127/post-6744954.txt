To me, it's a simple photoshop. Dude knew enough to target the 7th planet then got it in his rear view, copied and pasted an icy body from some other screenshot, and then just lessened the opacity to make it appear "ghosted." Also probably just pulled the "8" in the body description from another screen shot as well.
