It was four...but who's counting? I don't have a reddit account or I'd comment in the thread. But it looks like this thread has already been linked over there. For whatever my opinion is worth, the OP from reddit is 100% making it up. I spent a significant amount of time in all four systems with "raxxla" in their names. There were no USS's in any of them and no phantom planets.

ETA: I signed up for reddit....what have I done?

I'm not surprised by it anyway. Frontier has repeatedly stated that it would be something that we have never seen before. A transparent planet is not enough to prove its worth at all.

His photoshop skills need some work, though, that's for sure.
