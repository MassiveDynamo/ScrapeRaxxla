And he only found one of them. You got five or something.

It was four...but who's counting? I don't have a reddit account or I'd comment in the thread. But it looks like this thread has already been linked over there. For whatever my opinion is worth, the OP from reddit is 100% making it up. I spent a significant amount of time in all four systems with "raxxla" in their names. There were no USS's in any of them and no phantom planets.

ETA: I signed up for reddit....what have I done?
