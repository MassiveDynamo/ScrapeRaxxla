I believe in the previous post in this thread that system only had 7 planets. Did he visit it and find an 8th one? He either found a hidden planet in the system or he faked the image.

Is anyone near the system? Someone should revisit it to find out.

One brown dwarf and seven un-landable bodies.



Or does the game count the sun as 1 and the 7th planet as 8?
