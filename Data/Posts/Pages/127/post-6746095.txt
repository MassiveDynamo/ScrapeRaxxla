I'm not surprised by it anyway. Frontier has repeatedly stated that it would be something that we have never seen before. A transparent planet is not enough to prove its worth at all.

His photoshop skills need some work, though, that's for sure.

The post DOES describe it as a Glitch.......... ah whatever. I'm just logging this away as another, more extreme, case of space-madness. Seeing Ghost Worlds and all.

Speaking of Space madness: Ooscs Bra XX-L a7-0 Hypao Bra XX-L a7-0 Phooe Bra XX-L a76-0, and Dryu Bra xx-l a7-07. For those interested.
