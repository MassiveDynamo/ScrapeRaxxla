Just a thought: but we can likely guess the sub-type of the "unnamed gas giant" provided we have some basic details on the species involved. Also, were warmth the issue their are some hot gas giants that are not stars that might be worthy of consideration. It isn't like FDev gave us nothing. Certain types of life have specific bio-requirements. Think outside the very generic box you've been given.
