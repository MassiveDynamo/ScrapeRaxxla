TL;DR version of prior posting:

Raxxla is found before we ever met Thargoids by numerous centuries. Raxxla predates Faraway by centuries. We are looking for something Guardian. The hyperspace reverse-engineered story is a sham to keep you distracted. You as a CMDR have been given a Codex Map with rumors of locations for each species for each sector of the galaxy with specific system locations. Use that because the search does not have to be blind at all.
