scrolled. checked responses. scrolled.
looks like u still have no idea

I will remind - it was 120 years between 1st try to go to stars + 1st mention of RAXXLA.
So radius is darn short.
if u count miss jumps. then u must count at least 1/2 of this to get radio back to make "RAXXLA" word.
And we have fixed point WHEN raxxla was mentioned.
