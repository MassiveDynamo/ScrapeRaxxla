No worries.

I think what I find useful when I'm working on/discussing game fiction is to make a clear distinction in how I write about the fiction and the fiction itself. That way, much as I'm a fan from way back when I played the original Elite in the 1980s, I'm differentiating that from working professionally on a project. I don't get 'caught up', those moments usually happen after when I reflect on the opportunity I had, or have. They don't happen on discussion forums, Discord, etc.

That also helps when I move on from a project. It makes it easier.

A case in point, last night, I was discussing a formative comic book franchise from my childhood that I may have a chance to work on (pitching ideas at the moment) and earlier in the week discussing other applications for procedurally generated narrative, which I first discovered when I played Elite. Both very exciting possible projects, but only worth getting really excited about if they happen.

Sometimes it is the possibility that is important in moving ideas forward. Reminder to all here that what I have been doing despite all appearances to the contrary is changing perception not actual events. The past is the past and utterly unchangeable. How we perceive the past and use that information is flexible, though. It is why I tend to think of my in-game persona as a very powerful oneiromancer which fits rather nicely with the whole Dreamware idea from First Encounters. That's the reason my forums and Discord avatars are symbol for Hekate - a Titaness who actually saved the Olympic gods and was deeply respected by them.
