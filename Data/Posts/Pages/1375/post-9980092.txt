Soontil is the creation of John Harper, and therefore not connected with Raxxla. Soontil Relics, sold by Robert Garry, are simply an easter egg as per all of the other book references. If you won't even listen to Allan Stroud about the origins of the lore, you're lost. Forget Elite 1, forget books. The ONLY references to Raxxla are in game, in the codex. Hell, Raxxla itself in Elite Dangerous might only be an easter egg reference to the first Novella in 1984 and the subsequent search lasting a decade, which proved utterly fruitless.
I really hope it is in game somewhere, and towards the end of the story, we might have a chance to find it... but you are not going to find anything other than a mental breakdown by linking every last thing to it. I speak from experience.
