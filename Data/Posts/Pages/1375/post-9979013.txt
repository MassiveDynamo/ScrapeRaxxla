Sneaky Walden clones... I wonder if there are any still out there...
Have you looked in a mirror lately? Seems CMDRs are all the same height. Find TDW. Find Raxxla...

On a more important note, can we please quit fighting and focus on the future. You do not fight/communicate/try to find common ground with a hive-mind species the way you do with humans who are mixed between individuals and groups. Unification is no longer about merely doing the common sense approach to finding Raxxla it is about uniting humanity under one banner to survive. Canonn Science just found the 8th "Stargoid". There is so much more I cannot say, yet. But do yourselves a favor and read the AEGIS codex. TDW is likely the engineers and all the Elite CMDRs. We were invited by them at beginning of the game. TDW is the best hope we have of forming a multi-displinary AEGIS or (shield) against the coming dark days. The Dark Wheel may be made up of imperfect humans but we work better together. So, yes, the Club and The Dark Wheel are likely the same thing. They aren't entirely bad but mistakes were made but we had more success than failures. Also, Mycoid came first from Imperial Naval Reserve Arm and it's goal was eradication of artificial intelligence and other things that would make us a target for the Guardian Civil AI. The Martian Relic was likely Guardian and part of a warp drive.

No, the Raxxla hunt is likely not over. There is a lot left to do. As members of The Dark Wheel, please work together or everything will have been in vain.
