Thanks for answering.
No worries.

I think what I find useful when I'm working on/discussing game fiction is to make a clear distinction in how I write about the fiction and the fiction itself. That way, much as I'm a fan from way back when I played the original Elite in the 1980s, I'm differentiating that from working professionally on a project. I don't get 'caught up', those moments usually happen after when I reflect on the opportunity I had, or have. They don't happen on discussion forums, Discord, etc.

That also helps when I move on from a project. It makes it easier.

A case in point, last night, I was discussing a formative comic book franchise from my childhood that I may have a chance to work on (pitching ideas at the moment) and earlier in the week discussing other applications for procedurally generated narrative, which I first discovered when I played Elite. Both very exciting possible projects, but only worth getting really excited about if they happen.
