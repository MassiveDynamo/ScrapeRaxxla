Well if we look at the idea, the news might have spread from Sol to Tau Ceti. I'm curious why Cora wasn't interested in Raxxla considering only thing Cora did was chase down treasure and does it constantly. And based on how Art Tornqvist is always lending his ship to Cora. But most importantly the way he phrased it in a way that he would go along with the hunt every night for how long? What was Cora really after that she had a story every night of treasure. Someone that dedicated would have a goal in mind as to what they are looking for.
