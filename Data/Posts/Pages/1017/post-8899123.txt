No. Drew knows the lore for what there is available to be known by all. He just doesn't have any more info on Raxxla than the rest of us, which is lore accurate. O7 and welcome

You're right, I was mis-remembering Robert Holdstock's "Elite: The Dark Wheel" as having been a fictional piece written by Drew (it's been a while since I've read any source material). Thank you for the correction.

Footnote: Elite: The Dark Wheel was packaged with the original game, so it's lore could technically be considered canon. Just wanted to clarify; I'm not saying it's 'fictional' in regards to what knowledge it presents about the in-game Raxxla and Dark Wheel.
