everyone is in the pilots fed .. have you ever come across an npc that doesn't have a rank? no. they're all in the pilots fed.

permit system is ubiquitous. it's part of the ship. Not the pilot. it works for everyone.

you can conclude one of the following.
1. The ship has the permit.
2. The ship has a way around permits they're not sharing with you.
3. Fdev has crappy programming that allows things that shouldn't happen happen (like being able to acquire docking privs from any distance)
