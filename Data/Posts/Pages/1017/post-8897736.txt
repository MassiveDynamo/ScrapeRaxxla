I like this idea but being one of the “you could do it from the beginning” believer it could be Soontil relics, trinkets or or sap8?

Do you have a reference for that “you could do it from the beginning” quote?

A lot of things about Raxxla have been quoted but proven to be urban myths/misunderstandings/misinterpretation/trolls, so we try to keep a record of all the things he really said.

edit: to be clear, I think he actually said "Raxxla has been in-game since the gamma", however that is logically not the same as "Raxxla has been accessible since the gamma". However my own personal opinion is that Raxxla is his own Easter Egg and tribute to Robert Holdstock, and I don't think it makes any sense at all for Raxxla to be in-game but not accessible; so I don't think it's hidden behind a permit lock or by any other mechanism unless there is a gameplay path to gain that permit...I actually suspect it is somewhere obvious but I do think FD are over-fond of RNG criteria and suspect that Raxxla will in practice be a bit of a pain to locate.
