Welcome to the thread! (and to the forums, judging from the join date! )

Some good questions you've got, but a bit of filling in of info would probably be useful.

Let me try to bring you up to speed on a few bits of key info (which you may or may not already know).

Guardian and Thargoid background info:


Other key Thargoid info:

Other key info:
We (players) had predicted that there had been a Thargoid-Guardian territorial crossover/conflict well before it came out in game via the Ram Tah missions. This was based on the point above, along with an apparent lack of Guardian sites in the Guardian bubble towards that area (and/or the Witchhead Nebula). The prediction then got further substantial supporting evidence when the hostile reaction of Thargoid tech to Guardian tech was later observed in game.

See post covering the extent of the main Guardian bubble here:

Col 70 Sector FY-N C21-3 is approximately at the 7 o'clock point on the circle. (It's actually effectively inside the circle slightly as the circle represents a sphere, and Col 70 Sector FY-N C21-3 is at a point on the underside of the sphere, if that makes sense).

(This might all be slightly OT for the Raxxla thread, but who knows! It's all info, anyway, and there's no telling what is and isn't connected! )
