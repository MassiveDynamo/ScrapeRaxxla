I've had similar thoughts that Raxxla is likely the sole focus of the toast so every part might be describing an aspect of Raxxla rather than a way to get to it.

1. To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies A description of Raxxla itself?
2. To the whisperer in witchspace, the siren of the deepest void 'Whisperer' (note: singular) implies that it is one thing within Witchspace itself eminating a signal or communication of some kind - perhaps a link to Thargoids or something inhabiting this subspace tunnel.
3. The parent's grief, the lover's woe, and the yearning of our vagabond hearts This seems to infer loss as if to say that Raxxla takes away something of great value - parent's grief of losing a child, lover's woe of losing a partner. If the Dark Wheel are still in search of Raxxla then its members would have sacrificed a lot in search of it. Perhaps Raxxla requires a sacrifice of some kind - or that it is powered by Witchspace itself.
