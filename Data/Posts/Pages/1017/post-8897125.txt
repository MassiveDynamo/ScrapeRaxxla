Have you ever looked at the cargo of ships going to Witch's reach? I had the thought last night that maybe a specific combination of cargo is needed to try to access hidden areas in the game. I was looking at others talk about "a door that is also a key", and I came to the conclusion that there is a material in-game that fits that descriptor - Meta-alloys.

Meta-alloys are the material used by Thargoids presumably in the manufacturing and operation of their vessels. In a sense, they are the key to the power that they exude, but it is also the doorway to Thargoid Witchspace, accessible only when a Goid vessel high wakes out of the system. Just my two cents. Raxxla's on my mind
I like this idea but being one of the “you could do it from the beginning” believer it could be Soontil relics, trinkets or or sap8?
