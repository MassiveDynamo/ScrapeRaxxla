You're right, I was mis-remembering Robert Holdstock's "Elite: The Dark Wheel" as having been a fictional piece written by Drew (it's been a while since I've read any source material). Thank you for the correction.

Footnote: Elite: The Dark Wheel was packaged with the original game, so it's lore could technically be considered canon. Just wanted to clarify; I'm not saying it's 'fictional' in regards to what knowledge it presents about the in-game Raxxla and Dark Wheel.
Yea I would agree but it seems a lot of stuff in it has been retconned, though what all has been is extremely unclear and FDev has no intention of clearing it up
