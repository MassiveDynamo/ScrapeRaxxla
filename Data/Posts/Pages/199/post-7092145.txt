From the live stream yesterday they briefly showed the permits Adam had unlocked on his newly wiped account. They were Founders world, the three capitols (Sol, Alioth, and Achenar) and oddly enough Sirius. At the time it seemed strange, but it might just be related to systems with both permits and engineers. However, with Dev Magic available with only a few keystrokes messing with the permits (and only a few at that) would seem unnecessary. The asp Adam was flying did not appear to be engineered based on the limited jump range. (Think it was something less than 20 ly). Does anyone know if other dev account on live streams have had similar permits unlocked.
