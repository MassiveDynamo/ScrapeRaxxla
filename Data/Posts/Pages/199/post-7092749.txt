Codex seems then to be going to be populated by breadcrumbs then - they want us to go out there and find the things they hid but no-ones unearthed, its a big galaxy and there wasn't much to go on or what we had was either too literal or obtuse. Raxxla will turn up soon, Codex will allow FD to seed clues 'lookie here go over there you fool'. Personally I hope that's not the case because its going to be over very quickly as there are some sharp minds out there snd sometimes FD underestimate them.

I'd rather it stay hidden.
