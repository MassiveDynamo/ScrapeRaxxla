The obvious candidate for "it's just an ordinary planet" is Ra 10a

10 in roman numerals is X
Ra 10 is the largest Gas Giant in the system - 'extra large', or XL. Coincidence?

So Ra X(XL) a ... or more conventionally Ra 10a ... is Raxxla.

Nice hypothesis, but don’t see how it fits the “personal journey” or “place that is not a place, door that is also the key”; assuming the latter really was a clue & not DW misdirection!
