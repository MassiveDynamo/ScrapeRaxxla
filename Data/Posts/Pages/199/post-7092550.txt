Every people,

I just checked in-game, and the mention of Raxxla in the video I cannot find in the system map... I checked the space port and the main star.

Am I missing something? I was curious to read the mention of Raxxla in this system but cannot find it...

POST EDIT sorry, for the system 17 Draconis...
