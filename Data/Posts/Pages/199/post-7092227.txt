From the live stream yesterday they briefly showed the permits Adam had unlocked on his newly wiped account. They were Founders world, the three capitols (Sol, Alioth, and Achenar) and oddly enough Sirius. At the time it seemed strange, but it might just be related to systems with both permits and engineers. However, with Dev Magic available with only a few keystrokes messing with the permits (and only a few at that) would seem unnecessary. The asp Adam was flying did not appear to be engineered based on the limited jump range. (Think it was something less than 20 ly). Does anyone know if other dev account on live streams have had similar permits unlocked.

Really, that ship could have a 1 LY range and the dev could move it from one side of the galaxy to the other side with a couple key strokes. The systems he unlocked the credits he had was whatever he felt like he wanted for this session. I expect right after the live stream he unwiped his save since it was probably setup for him to test out stuff. He didnt want to show that save on the stream as it may have contained information not yet available to the normal player.

Each dev would have his own way of handling this situation so I would not try and use any comparison to glean information as it would not that useful.
