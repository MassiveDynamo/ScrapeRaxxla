The most depressing thing I've heard so far is "According to FDev a CMDR entered the system, honked and moved on." > . <

This is urban myth.

If there is evidence somewhere of FDev confirming that someone visited Raxxla and left unaware, we need to find it and link it in the OP. Personally, I think it is urban myth but if it does exist, it is exactly the sort of thing this thread should record.

I have so far collected the following rumour, speculation and he-said-she-said forum foam:-

"Some person told me. They said someone was in the system but just honked and jumped away."
"They also said that it came from the FDev panel, idk how credible it is but I wouldnt be suprised if it happened"
