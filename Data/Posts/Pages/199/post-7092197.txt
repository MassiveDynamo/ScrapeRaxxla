Just adding to the fake news / not real topic.

I DON'T think FDEV would add stuff to the codex just as a joke. Imagine that salt that would happen when it was found out. I think they are ready to let this chapter open just like they planted that dude who found Jaques. Never posted before never posted after that event. He was inserted to progress that story line.

No one knows what RAXXLA is but whatever it is it is real and findable, not even fdev would be that sadistic.

My 2 cents and IMHO and YMMV and FWIIW (I could keeping going but)
