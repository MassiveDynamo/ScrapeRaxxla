I believe that is no coincidence. I tell you what Raxxla is and where it will be found, just listen.
Raxxla is nothing else than an ancient Guardian outpost in one of the outermost white dwarf or neutron star systems. It looks exactly like one of the well known ancient ruins sites
One of those that look like a huge key from above. It is really easy to see the key in that structure..
By the way, it is placed on a rather tiny rock that orbits directly through the dwarf/neutron stars beams, so it is hidden i1n one of those new upcoming mists/nebulaes and it will be tricky to approach without getting blown up. Thats how FDev thinks thats appropriate for Raxxla. By the way.. it has to be there in the mists of a neutron star, because it is a giant supercharging slingshot machine to the next galactic systems and that one needs enormous energy coming from the neutron star beams to charge up. By the way.. search for the outermost neutron stars directly in the direction of andromeda or the magellan clouds. If you happen to find brain trees somewhere there.. bingo, dont stop until you´re sitting at the door and remember good old Scorprox for giving you these hints. I´ll not go searching for myself, because I´m already searching for my own lost home planet. If you happen to find it by chance while searching for your Raxxla then please let me know. My planet´s called Oxo! Bllllllbllllbllllp!
