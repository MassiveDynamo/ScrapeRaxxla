Yea... tbh the thing that points me to the idea of it being Triple Elite is when Frontier say (paraphrasing) "We want this to be each persons journey" - to me that screams, "This is super end game and locked to only those that have done EVERYTHING"... I wouldn't be surprised if perhaps when fully ranked up in imp/fed (and possibly only one, not both) AND Triple/Quadruple Elite, then something starts?

Or possibly even Triple Elite with no Fed/Imp rank? Who knows. Total Tinfoil but still.. another view or possibility I guess?
