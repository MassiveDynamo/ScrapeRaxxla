I know DJTruthSayer has theorized that Raxxla can only be found by a Triple Elite but, like almost everything surrounding Raxxla, nothing confirmed regarding that.

Why TRIPLE Elite, if true ?
You only need Elite to interact with TDW. So ... (tinfoiling) if true, you need the other two Elite status in order to get the trade and combat Elite (assuming you started Elite as Explorer) missions from the factions involved. Then ... unlocks...something?
(If someone wants to try a little experiment: get allied with TDW, then go to Mariyacoch and look closely at you status with the factions there and the first welcome speech. Anything special ?
Repeat in Ticushpakhi.)

Just a theory

@Han_Zen: wow !
