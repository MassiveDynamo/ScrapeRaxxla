What we know is that The Dark Wheel traditionally don't deal with non Elites. If you are to get help from them, you beter have that badge.

On the other hand we know that DW hasn't found Raxxla them self, so I don't know how much they are of use at all.

Well... more specifically we know that they split in half around 50 years ago and one bunch went off to continue the search for Raxxla (fate unknown) and the other half went to search for (and found) Soontil and formed the CIEP.

It's possible that in the last 50 years the DW found it...
