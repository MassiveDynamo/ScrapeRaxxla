What we know is that The Dark Wheel traditionally don't deal with non Elites. If you are to get help from them, you beter have that badge.

Interesting that the Sap 8 Core Container is seen together with a Thargoid Sensor and a Meta-Alloy.

Edit: Also the carrier is an Elite Federal Corvette; he might need some major persuasion to surrender the cargo. Maybe even some bad player/good player tactics.
