Mucho envy - I wish I could find enough time to engage in an expedition like that !!!

Still waiting to get my first Elite rank and meet The Dark Wheel - so they don't give 'special' missions at all @ Jameson Memorial etc?

Also, what are peoples views on what Raxxla will be? I've read the books so get what is described... I struggle to see how that would work with the current game though.. :S
