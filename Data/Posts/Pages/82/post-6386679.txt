There were missions being given out by the Dark Wheel that seemed to relate to Raxxla (see beginning of this thread) but they have stopped being given out now.

I am so disappointed by this - these missions have been driving me to hit Elite. Is anyone here triple/quadruple Elite? Perhaps this matters now?
