I know DJTruthSayer has theorized that Raxxla can only be found by a Triple Elite but, like almost everything surrounding Raxxla, nothing confirmed regarding that.

What we know is that The Dark Wheel traditionally don't deal with non Elites. If you are to get help from them, you beter have that badge.

On the other hand we know that DW hasn't found Raxxla them self, so I don't know how much they are of use at all.

By the way
