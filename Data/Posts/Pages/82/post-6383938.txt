What about CD-82 331? It is easy for 3s and 8s to get misread when typing/proofing etc. And that is in SIMBAD (not sure if it is in game? currently not installed).
Good thinking! I don't think any of the gas giants are named "Middleton" though.

I think what's more interesting is the potential location of the Ceeper bases and where "Home" is for Oberon. But I don't think we have enough clues yet.

Edit: I mean more interesting in the context of finding Raxxla.
