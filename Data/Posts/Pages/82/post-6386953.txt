My thoughts where that you would need only 'Combat Elite' - that was the original lore and the only 'Elite' status back in the Day. But this didn't work for me so I've become triple elite and allied to the DW still no special messages, I am also ranked rear admiral and duke.

I will now work on achieving 'Admiral' and 'King' (I hate that rank, it should be Senator). I will become CQC Elite whilst I take part in DWE2, so that I can do a little 'pew pew' whilst looking for Raxxla on a major expedition. But that wont be until the end of this year possibly 1Q 2019.
