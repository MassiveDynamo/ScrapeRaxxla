I am so disappointed by this - these missions have been driving me to hit Elite. Is anyone here triple/quadruple Elite? Perhaps this matters now?

I know DJTruthSayer has theorized that Raxxla can only be found by a Triple Elite but, like almost everything surrounding Raxxla, nothing confirmed regarding that.
