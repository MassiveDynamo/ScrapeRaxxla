Hey all,

Sssooo, odd question really, but here goes - was Raxxla actually in the original Elite, or any Elite title since? I.e. is there any proof of someone finding it?

Screenshots etc? Even anecdotal evidence (which is all we ever get anyways) would be great!?

O7 CMDRS.

EDIT: Spelling

The original Elite game had 8 galaxy's each with 256 systems in. I visited every galaxy and most systems (some were impossible to get to - not enough jump range) partly because I wanted to have explored everything and partly to find Raxxla. It wasn't there as far as I could tell.

There was rumored to be a 9th galaxy where Raxxla was in the bottom left hand corner of the map - But I never found a ninth galaxy. I also searched for Raxxla in Frontier / Frontier First encounters but never found it.

I'm currently looking for Raxxla in ED so I have quite literally been searching since 1984!

Everything is Rumor and hearsay, mentions of it in various novels and space bars, and that's what makes the search fun, we could all be chasing the wind BUT MB and DB have confirmed that is in game to be found . There were missions being given out by the Dark Wheel that seemed to relate to Raxxla (see beginning of this thread) but they have stopped being given out now.

So welcome to tinfoiling
