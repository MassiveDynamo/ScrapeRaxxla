FYI, the Cete is a reference to Cetacean (whales), Herman Melville wrote Moby . <-- this word is being auto censored apparently, you all know what it is.

The Guardian 'truth' is our Melville's white whale (it killed him in the end after he became obsessed and endangered his crew, etc. etc.)
We also have good old Ishmael Palin. Ishmael is of course the name of the first person narrator in the Moby D story.
