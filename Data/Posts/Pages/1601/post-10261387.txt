Forgot to mention Cete is an interesting choice of name and associated with the Andromeda myths... "Mother of Galaxies" hypotheses mentioned previously a few times... just a thought
FYI, the Cete is a reference to Cetacean (whales), Herman Melville wrote Moby . <-- this word is being auto censored apparently, you all know what it is.

The Guardian 'truth' is our Melville's white whale (it killed him in the end after he became obsessed and endangered his crew, etc. etc.)
