FYI, the Cete is a reference to Cetacean (whales), Herman Melville wrote Moby . <-- this word is being auto censored apparently, you all know what it is.

The Guardian 'truth' is our Melville's white whale (it killed him in the end after he became obsessed and endangered his crew, etc. etc.)
Interesting!

I was referring to this from Wikipedia

"In Ancient Greek ketos (κῆτος, plural kete/ketea, κήτη/κήτεα[1]), Latinized as cetus (pl. ceti or cete = cetea[2]), is any huge sea monster.[3] According to the mythology, Perseus slew a cetus to save Andromeda from being sacrificed to it. The term cetacean (for whale) derives from cetus. In Greek art, ceti were depicted as serpentine fish. The name of the mythological figure Ceto is derived from kētos. The name of the constellation Cetus also derives from this word."
