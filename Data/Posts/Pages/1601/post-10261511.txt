(The battle sites are of course a bit weird: the Guardian part of the site functions perfectly normally, suggesting that it "won" the battle or was recaptured and repaired afterwards ... but the Guardians apparently never bothered to clean up all the Thargoid wreckage around them. It's quite possible that lots of other Guardian sites were the site of battles with the Thargoids, but were maintained afterwards so it's not obvious nowadays. On that basis it could be any outlying Guardian nebula settlement area...)
It's awfully hard to lose when both sides are the same species (well other than having your society destroyed). Either these are the same species or one evolved into a slightly different version. Oresrians look like Thargoids. Coincidence? Doubtful.

Humans are either a species bio-engineered by Thargoids/Oresrians or we got along so splendidly that some humans are hybrids between the two or androids. See the Undine myths ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undine ).
