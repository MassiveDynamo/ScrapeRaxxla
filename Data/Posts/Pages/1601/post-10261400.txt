If you are looking at wolf-rayets you are seeing where Guardians used to live but not how the system was at the time. Wolf-rayets are too hot to support life.

I don't know anything about WR stars, but the Guardian History tells us this:

"Their earliest records tell of a great upheaval caused by climate change, and although the exact cause isnâ€™t recorded, there are references to a dimming of the sun. Whatever the cause, the effect was a drop in global temperature."

Does the above tie in with anything known about WR stars? If not, then WR stars probably aren't important to Guardians based on biology. If it does, then that's more supporting evidence.

That might well indicate that Regor is the Guardian homeworlds, because they happened to evolve not near a nebula - and then like humans and maybe even Thargoids have placed pretty much all their other settlements near one for convenience - though humans have not yet figured out what to do with nebulae, other than where Thargoids have already established meta-alloy processing to steal from.

Good points, all. I don't think there's currently any Lore that supports Regor being the Guardians origin point, and I do think there's minor support for is not being, but you make a good point.

Which nebula(s) do you think might have been the one(s) that sparked the Guardian-Thargoid conflict, since there aren't any of significance near the Regor sector?

"Tens of thousands of years earlier, when the Guardians were still a non-spacefaring race, a group of Thargoids entered what would later become Guardians space looking for new systems to colonise. In addition to earmarking several systems containing ammonia worlds, they prepared a number of planets for occupation by seeding them with barnacles."
