Nebulae?
What's weird about this, now @Emperor pointed out nebula and it made me think about it... (and I think your point about Nebulae being related to the Toast is possible too )


"To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies!
To the whisperer in witchspace, the siren of the deepest void!
The parent's grief, the lover's woe, and the yearning of our vagabond hearts.
To Raxxla!
â€” Alleged toast of the Dark Wheel"

Mother of Galaxies... Which came first the Chicken or the Egg, or in this case the Stars or the Galaxies? (Protostars at the very beginning....)

Where are stars born.... Stellar Nurseries in Nebulas generally? - the Mother of stars and therefore galaxies?
Where's the nearest?

"The Orion Nebula, also known as Messier 42 (M42) or NGC 1976, is one of the most famous and easily recognisable celestial objects in the night sky. It is located in the constellation Orion and is visible to the naked eye as a hazy patch of light just below Orion's Belt.

Here are some key facts about the Orion Nebula:
Location: The Orion Nebula is situated about 1,344 light-years away from Earth, making it one of the closest stellar nurseries to our solar system.
Nebula Type: It is a diffuse emission nebula, meaning it is a cloud of gas and dust that emits its own light. Specifically, it is a part of a much larger molecular cloud complex called the Orion Molecular Cloud Complex.
Stellar Nursery: The Orion Nebula is a region of active star formation, where new stars are being born. Within the nebula, there are numerous young, hot stars called protostars, which are in the process of accumulating mass from the surrounding gas and dust. These young stars are surrounded by glowing gas and can be seen as the bright points of light within the nebula."
Other than references to Orion as a jewel and the nebula itself.... are there any other shiny things above the nebula?

Alnilam?

Just a thought!
