While scouring the web for any remote tidbit of Raxxla lore, as yet undisturbed, i was directed to the comment section beneath the Raxxla wiki where this can be seen: not having played the original games, can anyone confirm it?

"The original Raxxla is a planet with a Coriolis station also named "Raxxla" in Galaxy 9, Andromeda."

Well in the original, there were "only" 8 galaxies, and none of them were named, or have any real objects in them. Raxxla did not exist in the original game, other than being in the Dark Wheel novella.

Where did that quote come from though? It is quite inventive
