I have a couple of INRA sites that I have not visited yet, I will go check this. If this works at least we will have a slightly better understanding of just what type of scan may be needed

**Update - Upon entering the system I did an FSS and located a human source on the planet. After a DSS I located and was able to lock with the site and descend. Once entering glide it did however unlock and had to reselect

Good to see the scientific method being applied again in this thread! Hypothesis->test->result-> increased knowledge!
Repped!
