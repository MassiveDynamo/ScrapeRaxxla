Took myself a look see. Got excited for a second because there is a large, unusually square, stone pretty much right on 0/0. Unfortunalty I forgot my vehicle hanger lol. But using the orbital camera there doesnâ€™t seem to be anything special about it other than being quite square and on 0/0

Sounds like it could be Omphalos Stone?
