While scouring the web for any remote tidbit of Raxxla lore, as yet undisturbed, i was directed to the comment section beneath the Raxxla wiki

This was pretty obscure thing to unravel, and one of my favourites. You see, original Elite was published in 1984, for BBC Micro and Acorn Electron. It was considered a really good game at the time, and was ported for multiple platforms. As years passed, the game ended up having myriad different versions, and unofficial amateur versions too. This was part of the subculture at the time. Oolite, and Elite: Dangerous, was born out of similar desire too, to make a new, better Elite, a game you always wished existed.

There was one, local, Aprils Fool joke, that such game could exist. It gained some attention, in -89, or very early 90's, and this was perhaps also noticed by Lord B at the time. The author of this Raxxla lore did refer to this, though he might have included some other rumours also, that included other unofficial game versions. I have no access to the original source material this originates from, but do understand language in question well enough to rely on second hand sources. And its basically this thing, though this is slightly more modern iteration of it, but this is enough to understand:
