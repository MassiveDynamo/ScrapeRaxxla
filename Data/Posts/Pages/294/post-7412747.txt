While scouring the web for any remote tidbit of Raxxla lore, as yet undisturbed, i was directed to the comment section beneath the Raxxla wiki where this can be seen: not having played the original games, can anyone confirm it?

"The original Raxxla is a planet with a Coriolis station also named "Raxxla" in Galaxy 9, Andromeda.

Raxxla itself is a feudal world with reptile race with higher technology level than humans. Raxxlans were extremely hostile to every other race. War was what they loved and aimed for. Raxxla itself is not hard to find. Raxxlans will attack without hesitation giving out their location. The closer you get more aggressive they become. Anyone in their territory must be Elite or die. They will give the permit to enter their station after you have proven your skills in battles against them.

Raxxlans had a formed a trade partnership and military alliance with Dark Wheel in 3025. Dark Wheel had an agricultural settlement on the planet Soonji, which was named after Soontil. Only 100 Elite level commanders were allowed to have a residence on this planet due fact Raxxlans did not want large and permanent human settlements near their territory. Soonji was known as a paradise for retirement.

While the alliance was maintained 100 years the trading kept only a few Elites rich. It is known from history that all the snake ships and the first type of Coriolis stations are Raxxlan designed. The Raxxlans were proud reptiles and they named their ships after their feared relatives. This was to remind human beings to respect them while using them.
