I think it was literally undetectable. They needed to know where it was or needed these access codes to locate it. I appreciate that article because itâ€™s matching with my Raxxla hypothesis. We need a module or permit of some kind to locate Raxxla. Maybe at the end of a quest line or start of it. We grab some module or engineering to our DSS and start the hunt. Or some kind of device we carry in our cargo hold like we do it with the Thargoid Link to locate new surface sites.
