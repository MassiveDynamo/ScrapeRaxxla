I found an interesting article on the stellar aspect of the Elysian mysteries: http://www.panix.com/~gblt/eleusislaturarev82b.pdf

It has the elements needed to qualify as a Raxxla lead, linking Hecate (goddess of gates, crossrads and magic), Plato's cosmological model and real space phenomena.

I did a little checking. My best vector from Sol would be towards 1 Geminorum (1 Gem).

Haven't doen any deep digging, but it looks interesting.

Hecate's wheel looks a bit like the Raxxla logo as well.
