Sounds like it could be Omphalos Stone?

That’s what I was hoping on the way down there when it came into view. Unfortunalty I forgot my vehicle hanger so I couldn’t check it out on the ground really. But although it’s large, unusually square, and pretty well smack on 0/0 using the orbital camera there didn’t appear to be anything inscribed on it etc. and there was not something to lock on to, at least from the ship. So I figure it’s either a coincidence of the PG system, or a kind of Easter egg out there by a dev as a chuckle. I might go back with an SRV and have a look again but it didn’t look like something we could interact with.
