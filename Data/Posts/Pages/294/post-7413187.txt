This is the back of stones legacy base. I bet raxxla will be something like this with jump abilities or something. I would not be surprised. Are there a lot of these in the galaxy. Or do all stations have this but it's hidden by some back part it's attached too? Note the number of engines. A configuration of 6 with one in the middle.
