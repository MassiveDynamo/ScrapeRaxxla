This is the back of stones legacy base. I bet raxxla will be something like this with jump abilities or something. I would not be surprised. Are there a lot of these in the galaxy. Or do all stations have this but it's hidden by some back part it's attached too? Note the number of engines. A configuration of 6 with one in the middle.
There are other stations like that, even back in season 1 when stations were first sent to Ceos and Sothis, they had engines with exhaust plumes. In the lore, Ocellus stations are built in one location and sent through hyperspace to their target system, but some orbis stations can do that as well. Jaques station is an orbis type and it moved around once a month at the game's launch iirc. It is certainly possible that there is another station that does the same (but it has to move with a server reset).
