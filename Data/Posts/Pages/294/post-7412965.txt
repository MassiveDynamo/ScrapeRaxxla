Yeah, it does that.

Plus, the INRA sites we know of are the old, destroyed, exposed ones. They are not active, so they wouldn't be "undetectable" even if they were before.

That was my thinking as well. If it did have any, lets call it "stealth Technology" then that would of been destroyed or taken with the base. Always worth a look though.
