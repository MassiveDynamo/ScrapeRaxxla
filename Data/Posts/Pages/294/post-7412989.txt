The original Elite was before my time and as such I never played it but are we sure Raxxla wasn't in the original Elite? David Braben said in a stream once that there was a way to access more than the standard 8 galaxies coded into the game but they where never used, maybe the way to get there was never found?

it is Googlable - the procedural generation method used in the original Elite game was incompatible & I believe DB has admitted that Raxxla was not in the original.
