During the event's with the Children of Raxxla and Palomé we got hints about that something possible could be unlocked by selling a certain set of exploration data to The dark wheel in Shinrarta Dezhra. If this is true then it is not so strange that we are hitting blank for reason -

1. Data needs to be sold to the right station, maybe even the The dark wheel needs to have system control.
2. You need to be Elite to have access.
3. Most people exploring never ever think about it or go for the highest bidder ( ever thought about why Li-Yong-Rui want's your data so bad? )
4. The data needs to match.

There might also be further sub-requirements - like for example dealing with the Club conspiracy that seems to be undermining any progress.

For me this feels like a plausible explanation as to why we are hitting zero even though we seem to have a good idea on where to search from the lore.

I don't understand the part with Li-Yong Rui .
It is the pilot federation that want data if i remember well (Salomé told it in her logs).
