‘The earliest documented reference to Raxxla dates to 2296’.

‘its existence is evidence that the Raxxla legend was already in the public consciousness by that time.’

So up to 2296, the myth first appears; that’s someplace between Tau Ceti and all those systems colonised up to that point, and those between and possibly just on the outskirts; may hold Raxxla. The question is which.

I’m currently locked out of the game due to my primary account being subject to a hardware crash, I’m still attempting to get ED to re-install; but this assumption is where I am at present.

If we can draw comparisons between these locations and others of import (star constellations, narrative elements, generation ships, systems types etc) I wonder if they correlate?

It’s a large area, but remember upto 2296 many of the systems which had not been colonised by that point would have been in ‘uncharted’ territory. And ships would attempt direct line travel (or as close as possible) so the sphere of influence may be much narrower.

The date is our only primary clue (if it’s meant as a clue); and temporal / astrological mapping ought to draw up a hemisphere of influence for us to focus upon.
