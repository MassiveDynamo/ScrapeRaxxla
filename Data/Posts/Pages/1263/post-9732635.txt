why would the answer to Raxxla be in an overflow? That seems like a non logical assumption.
The point is to know the composition of a system with the logs, overflow lead to the signals from left panel.
But, some are hidden like comets, barycenter, belt origin.

The overflow just help to understand (for me) what are the missing "BodyID". As comets were unable to detect before, now i just know where to look, drop in, get the line in logs and find system composition. But there is still a work to do: sort information, understand how some systems are coded (currently i'm stuck trying to understand 25 Nu Cassiopeiae as it has very strange BodyID order and ID 2&4 crash the game, as if there were nothing. But IDs go to 16).

We don't use a hacking method (brute force or whatever), as like Cmdr Pyroboros said, we still have to go to the system.

Personnaly i don't think we could find Raxxla with this method because of 2 theories of my own:

Raxxla is triggered server-side with currently unknown requirements
Raxxla may/may not be in game but it is just unaccessible (i'm sure Polaris and LFT 509 would lead us to clues when/IF unlocked)

So for now, i think fdevs are just laughing to us while watching us try to find anything
