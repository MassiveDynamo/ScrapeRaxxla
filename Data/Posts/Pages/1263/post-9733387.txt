Raxxla has not been in any of the old games. All of them have had their scource code published. Ther is nothing in any of them.
Yes I get that but was it meant to be but due to the crashing it never happened so they left it out (or just didnt bother as they just wanted it released and had enough trouble with all the different versions) but yet still the game crashed.

I mean why the permit lock in Elite dangerous from a system everyone wanted to see which also crashes...bit suspicious that to be fair and also Hydrus being one of only non associated constellations with Mythology apart from the below

There is no mythology associated with Hydrus. The constellation is located so far south that it was not visible to the ancient Greeks or Romans. It was mapped by Dutch navigators and represents the sea snakes they would have encountered on their voyages.

While we hunt for Mythological chickens it may have been hidden where there is none All tinfoil of course
