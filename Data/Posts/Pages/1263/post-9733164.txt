Comets might not be orbiting visible stars, or may have some information hidden in their orbital elements. For those that have been able to track down comets it might be useful to figure out/ calculate the orbital parameters of these objects. Fdev could be riffing of the idea of a planet erased from the records only detectable via gravity a la Kamino in star wars for the raxxla mystery.
I don't think any in-game thing is expected to be found using out-of-game tools (like logs are out-of-game, those are part of "internet 21th century").
So what I think, if you can find RAXXLA it should be able to do using in-game tools only. And maybe some paper/pen.

Ah yes, about comets. No need to make new plots. It was just canceled by management as "not important now", and still remain in log as half-complete. No need to invent in-game mysteries.
