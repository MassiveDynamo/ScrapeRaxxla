Just a note, Raxxla was apparently in Elite....Alpha Hydri system was always a game crash system and the only system in the game not able to enter to look at or take logs from, Now Elite Dangerous Alpha Hydri permit locked since gamma due to another crash that happened when released (Everyone flocked there as they couldn't in Elite and though hmmm)...see the pattern

First Star of Snake's Head...Elite ships named after Snakes and this being the First Star of them

The 6 points of the Raxxla logo from sol, 6 constellations and Hydrus being the center like a sort of Bermuda triangle, now heres a wild thinfoil hat, take the 6 constellations, take 6 of their main stars and take six letters from them and you can spell RAXXLA...this is going a bit far though

Raxxla has not been in any of the old games. All of them have had their scource code published. Ther is nothing in any of them.
