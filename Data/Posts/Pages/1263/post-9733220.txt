There are special stations. They are either the palm stations (Orbis) or Ocellus with statues. Neither will be tourist economy. They have a fairly high correlation to being in systems which where in Frontiers. There are two of them in Aymifa (both are palm tree Orbis): Polya Coliseum and Hunziker Orbital. In terms of two of the best examples of each type they are as follows:

Black Mausoleum in Beta Hydri (wealthy extraction) - Orbis

Galileo in Sol (wealthy refinery) - has a layout that looks similar to tourist but is not listed as such. This station is an ocellus. It should be noted that Gutamaya is the exclusive manufacturer of ocellus stations.
