Her description from tdw novela..
She was quite small. Her skin was olive, her eyes dark. She wore her hair in a fashionable series of spikes, like a porcupine.
Chapter 15 of ED Premonition:
“Ah, the Children of Raxxla.’ The spiky-haired woman began. ‘How sweet. I trust your trip was safe, Commanders?’
‘Safe as it can be in this day and age,’ replied Thorn.
The woman turned to him.
‘You understand who I represent, I assume, Commander Thorn?’
‘I’ve seen you run missions out of Shinrarta Dezhra,’ Thorn replied.
‘Shinrarta Dezhra?’ The woman laughed, her scorn plain to hear. ‘You think the Dark Wheel advertises on a station board in plain sight? That we need rookie pilots to drag a couple of tonnes of thrumpberry flavouring across to Hutton Orbital? A trivial ploy to keep the Founders off our backs.”
