So I've been away for 6 weeks or so in a dark corner of the world without much internet. These places still exist, and I thought it might be because I was near Raxxla, but alas I couldn't find it in the real world so I'm back in the virtual world! So, what's been happening, any news?!

Are we still roughly in the same place = no firm clues, and still debating if SD's TDW is actually TDW or are they pretenders? People still coming up with <insert god/pantheon/stories/fables/constellations randomly here> ideas that haven't yet born fruit?
