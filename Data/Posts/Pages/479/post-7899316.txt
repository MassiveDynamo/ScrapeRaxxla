Is it proved right/canon that TDW lady who introduced Salomé to CoR in Premonition was Rebecca ? I can't remember...
Btw, long time since I heard of these...

No, that was the spiky-haired woman. Possibly Elyssia Fields? I got confused at that point.
@Jaiotu: ah, got confused, was thinking Rebecaa was a member of TDW, but you’ve reminded me she was (for a while) a member of The Club. The spiky-haired woman was DW (at least Drew had that as part of her story in Premonition).
