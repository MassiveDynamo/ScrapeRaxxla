Mmmh... TDW have spiked hair, iirc. The Chim Hun Sq gear is said to mitigate the effects of space madness, up to a point... (already posted some of my foolish errands.). For battered vet Rifters, mainly.
"A test of courage and skill."
Not much of these are needed for Exploration or Trade/Transport... Contrariwise to combat based activities. (Or very high G landings? Unique/rare systems very difficult to reach? Delicate smuggling/transporting missions?)
But it's true it could lead to search for missions and tip offs demanding specially these qualities. The test will be "discreetly administered", they say. So, we shouldn't discard anything demanding courage and skill. Also, discretion and disguise would imply that the test is administered by TDW people under cover. Allies ? Vassals ? Partners ? Assets?
But not SD TDW faction. Would be way too inconsistent, even in ED.
(Reminds me the first time I was received at E/FThe first welcoming speech was like ".But, these are happy past times..)
Currently, I think, Tharg related missions would be what demands most and . But do these missions/tip offs exist ?
Finishing a specific CG in the first place/ top ten ? Would that attract their attention ? Would be a good way of screening possible candidates to the final test.

Mmm, I’m not sure tharg-bashing would appeal to “adventurers, explorers, investigators and treasure-hunters”.
Long-distance trips perhaps? Anyone done a couple of long-distance passenger missions for NTDW (especially if they were successor missions)?
Still feel I was on the right track with my interpretation of TDW toast....
