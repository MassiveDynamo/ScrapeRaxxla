A preliminary report on my survey of the sector called 'Phaa Chrie' in The Void. I'll be rushing back to take part in a Buckyball Racing Club event tomorrow, so it won't be for over a week, possibly, until I can get the full one sorted out with system names and uploaded imagery etc.

The key point: nothing whatsoever Raxxla-related.

Most of the bright stars (spectral type B or brighter) were surveyed in the last month. There are probably a handful remaining that are hard to find in the galaxy map. The brightest stars include three stars of spectral type B8 III, one K7 II and one K8 II. There was one AEBE5 VI with a B0 V secondary. Two neutron stars were found.
Of these systems, one included a significant number of biological signal sources, being all of the same Anemone type (of those visited), spread among four high-g planets.
Six systems were found with biological signal sources. Two varieties of Anemone were found and the rest were Crystalline Shards.
Earth-like Worlds: 7 (4 previously discovered, one of those had also been mapped)
Ammonia Worlds: 7
No Notable Stellar Phenomena were found. The Void lacks a Codex entry for Lagrange Clouds so they might be absent from this region, or be unusually rare.
It was a worthwhile visit to find this out and the Galactic Rim has a certain charm of its own with its low star density and the view of the Milky Way. Fly safe o7
