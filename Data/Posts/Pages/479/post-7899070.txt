Not much of these are needed for Exploration or Trade/Transport... Contrariwise to combat based activities.

Maybe try offering t-shirts and cake for the SDC? Rinzler might know a secret or two, or maybe Ryan. Harry probably doesn't but I bet he's hot. I once heard this rumour Raxxla can only be found in open mode, but I haven't tested it lately. It's still more likely than what the Twitch streamers say.

Or perhaps the CQC discord has been infiltrated by The Dark Wheel? I wouldn't be surprised if that was the case. I've learned much there. Musky probably knows where the Raxxla is but he won't tell.

I know for certain 200 million in Pilot's Federation combat bonds in one week won't unlock an invitation, but I wouldn't entirely rule out some of those anti-xeno groups haven't received one. Having observed how AXI operate against a green Thargoid (looks like spring onions), it seemed like there was some sort of plan to what they were doing.

I don't think Carcosa is Raxxla but perhaps it will become one in the future.
