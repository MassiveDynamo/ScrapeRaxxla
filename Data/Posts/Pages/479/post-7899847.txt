Chapter 15 of ED Premonition:
“Ah, the Children of Raxxla.’ The spiky-haired woman began. ‘How sweet. I trust your trip was safe, Commanders?’
‘Safe as it can be in this day and age,’ replied Thorn.
The woman turned to him.
‘You understand who I represent, I assume, Commander Thorn?’
‘I’ve seen you run missions out of Shinrarta Dezhra,’ Thorn replied.
‘Shinrarta Dezhra?’ The woman laughed, her scorn plain to hear. ‘You think the Dark Wheel advertises on a station board in plain sight? That we need rookie pilots to drag a couple of tonnes of thrumpberry flavouring across to Hutton Orbital? A trivial ploy to keep the Founders off our backs.”

Is there some kind of confirmation saying that Drew Wagar has anymore real information about the dark wheel than he has about raxxla. This is just my own thoughts on it though I don't really know what's going on.
