Thank you for the brief explanation. I did a lot of search for the ship mechanics name. Art Tornqvist always sounded interesting for me. Google says Art is short name for Arthur, and a Celtic masculine given name, meaning "bear", the surname is Swedish. Very interesting and rare combination. when you put it in a base64 decoder, it shows "9 PT".
ART TORNQVIST https://md5decrypt.net/en/Base64-decoder/ There are some non recognised characters maybe from ASCII table, but ART TORNQVIST is decoded as 9 PT
and Dr. Ross'es 10 PT joke made me think Maybe we should try base64 for the clues from the codex?

Anyone can confirm that was Elite 1984 used base64 in coding, due to memory restrictions?
Elite actually predates base64, as the original encoding standard (meant to send encrypted email as ASCII) was proposed in 1987.

The source code was released by Ian Bell a while ago; the system names were generated from three pairs of 16-bit "seeds" and a list of 32 tokens with two characters each.
This allowed fitting 8-character names such as Riedquat and Tionisla in only 6 bytes, something necessary given how scarce was memory in the BBC Micro¹.

Some reverse engineering of the system IDs² revealed that the Stellar Forge sectors are direct descendants, with the names being derived from the higher bits and the lower ones hosting boxel data.

¹ And making it run on the NES at all - much less feature-complete - was some Unseen University-level high wizardry
² There's a proper writeup somewhere on the internet instead of a source code with zero context, but I lost the link
