Unfortunately it doesn't so much represent the spectrogram in 3D as it does generate a wireframe waveform using an algorithm based on the audio. So, unfortunately, it's not really useful as what you see is only vaguely related to the sound itself.

However, it was a great idea, and if you find anything similar, do give me a shout

That's too bad, when I came across it in passing, the landscape signal was the first thing I thought of...

Not really sure how they work, but if you Google 3d spectrogram you'll be able to find several.

There's one more,
"3D Spectrogram Visualizer by Chris Donahue"
that looks alittle more promising, maybe...
it's able to create spectrograms of words/images in sound...
I think... lol
It's on an AWS site, that has GitHub links at the bottom...

But either way, maybe you can have better luck looking for one that might work however it should work, not really sure about the wire frame thing myself....
