Hello friends,

What I'm about to write now is probably off-topic or entirely related to my tinfoil time, but I need your help. I was watching retro ED videos and I came across this video of Dr. Ross:



At 38:55 Dr. Ross mentions a math error and says, "Ten points if you know what it is." Since English is not my native language, I think I don't understand a joke or expression here.

My question to you: What is the math error here and why Dr. Ross says "10 points if you know what it is"?

I ask this because there is a very strange coincidence and I have to convince myself that I am not crazy. We can all guess that the Raxxla codex entry contains clues, but I'm trying to understand what is assumption and what is breadcrumbs.

“10 points” is a joke, it’s a British pop-culture reference to TV game show catchphrase. Dr Ross was just saying there’s an error here - hypothetical credit for anyone who figures it out - it’s essentially saying the reward of points for doing so is not the prize, but the taking part. As the points were always irrelevant or overly high or low in comparison to the task at hand...
