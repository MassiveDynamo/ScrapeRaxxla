I think that might be over thinking things.

I caught the whole ‘Arthur / Bear / Thorn branch’ interpretation long ago. But I suspect the text of the Codex is either metaphorical or allegorical.

Reading Holdstock, ‘Ragthorn’ I was reminded of the thorny branch from the Epic of Gilgamesh. Is Arts name a reference to Holdstock?
We all over thinked too many possibilities here. Stretches and tinfoils in every corner. Maybe Art is referance to Holdstock. But where it leads?
