Posting this here because one of the authors for the "Tales of the Frontier" may have intentionally been given details on the mythical TDW station. The station was originally known simply as Citadel. To my knowledge, there are two Citadels in the game: Dublin Citadel in Gateway and Dantius Citadel of House Thiemann in Thethys. Both are Orbis stations. I don't remember specifically if they were dual toroidal but this may help. I should add "abandoned" is relative term. All the stations are supposed to be "officially abandoned" but are still in use. Neither is a station.

On a related note: Arx is not randomly chosen name. It is the Roman name for Citadel. Tagging @El Saico for visibility.
