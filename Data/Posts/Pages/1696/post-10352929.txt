Just for the record: TDW novella is but the tip of the proverbial iceberg but the codex in-game recycles the phrase "gateway between Universes".

From TDW novella:


The Codex in-game:
Several versions of the Raxxla story mention an alien artefact, the Omphalos Rift, described as a gateway or tunnel through which parallel universes can be accessed. These details, however, were later shown to bear a striking resemblance to the children's story Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars, and soon lost credibility. Undaunted, some Raxxla seekers insisted that the story's author had cunningly concealed facts about the mysterious locale in his book as hints for those with eyes to see.

Students of Raxxla lore have noted that the legend exerts a strangely potent fascination on the minds of seekers. Commentators have compared this sensation to 'fernweh', the unaccountable longing for a place one has never seen. More than one interstellar treasure-seeker has become obsessed with Raxxla to the exclusion of all other dreams, and spent his or her entire life in a futile search for it.

This, however, was far from the earliest or only mentions. There have been both earlier and much more recent mentions. None, have exactly clarified what it is exactly.

That's just the tip of the proverbial iceberg because a lot of Holdstock's science fiction appears to have influenced Elite's overall direction (though that isn't the only source per Transport Lakon Baker Gamma Sierra Heavy). In the end, they recycled the phrasing from TDW novella. In more modern times, Drew Wagar wrote extensively on Raxxla for Oolite and there have fan stories including stuff like AJN Lion which appears to the basis for Communication Array Delta 69 given the gravitational anomaly.

So, are the Easter Eggs Raxxla? Good question. I wish I knew the answer. Is it Onionhead given the weird typo? Or is it some alien construct? Hopefully, if we are lucky enough, we'll find out ... eventually.
