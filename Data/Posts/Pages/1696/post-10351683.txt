This Citadel idea may something to it. Also, been checking mountain and hills and that like Arx currency seems to point to mountains or defensive hills being important.

Citadel can mean Fort or Fortress. There are a few other words meaning the exact same thing.

We have quite an number of Orbis stations with Fort or Fortress in the name (also a few oddball Coriolis). These would have been "abandoned" in 3008 when Gaylen Trasken Duval made peace with the Federation.
Per Drew Wagar, the Club wanted central control via the Empire. This happened before the first game. The Feds were rebuffed when asking the Empire to join but the reverse apparently went through. This being why almost any faction has long haul supply routes to Imperial systems.
There is a system Arx Arcis which is Latin for "The center of the castle" - https://inara.cz/elite/starsystem/21907/ . Also, probably a candidate for a in-person visit





From Wikipedia entry on Arx (Roman):
- The arx of Londinium was located in the northwest corner of the present-day City of London, south of Cripplegate. It was constructed around 120 and dismantled around the time of Diocletian.There is a planet by the name of Londoninium in Alexandrinus ( https://inara.cz/elite/starsystem-bodies/9245/ ).

System description of Alexandrinus:
Home to a lost, ancient civilisation with primitive beliefs in divinity.

Someone needs to check this system, ASAP.
