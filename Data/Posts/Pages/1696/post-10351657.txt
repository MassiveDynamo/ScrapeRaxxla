Hello friends,

What I'm about to write now is probably off-topic or entirely related to my tinfoil time, but I need your help. I was watching retro ED videos and I came across this video of Dr. Ross:

At 38:55 Dr. Ross mentions a math error and says, "Ten points if you know what it is." Since English is not my native language, I think I don't understand a joke or expression here.

My question to you: What is the math error here and why Dr. Ross says "10 points if you know what it is"?

I ask this because there is a very strange coincidence and I have to convince myself that I am not crazy. We can all guess that the Raxxla codex entry contains clues, but I'm trying to understand what is assumption and what is breadcrumbs.
