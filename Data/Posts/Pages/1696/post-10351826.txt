I think that might be over thinking things, there is always a danger of going too far into historical relationships. What we really need are strong contextual links.

I caught the whole ‘Arthur / Bear / Thorn branch’ interpretation long ago.

But I suspect the text of the Codex is either metaphorical or allegorical.

Reading Holdstock, ‘Ragthorn’ I was reminded of the thorny branch from the Epic of Gilgamesh. And considering how much Holdstock is associated with Raxxla, and in my opinion, how he’s referenced in game through the Lost Realms zone, I believe Raxxla in ED is as much a Holdstockian theme.

Considering Gilgamesh, and Holdstocks running themes of mysterious lands and the ‘Otherworld’, there are various contextual links. In game many of the locations, and gods associated with that story are in game!

Is Arts name a reference to Holdstock and the epic of Gilgamesh, RH story ‘Ragthorn’?

Is Art a reference to King Arthur, and Tornqvist a reference to the thorny branch of both Gilgamesh and the holy grail of Arthur?

How much are Arthur and Tornqvist associated as metaphors for a hero’s journey…. In the end is the use of the name only the author trying to drop a contextual hint, to read ‘Ragthorn’?

Personally I think my above theory is a stretch too far, as there is very little historical academic context to back this up, as the two stories are separated by thousands of years.

Still no further forwards.
