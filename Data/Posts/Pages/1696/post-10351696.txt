Anyway, given the Roman/Aeneid angle has proven immensely promising I will put together a list of systems and stations that are likely technically abandoned. I still think we may have to find The Dark Wheel's main base before we find Raxxla. However, this is first time awhile I feel we might be making legitimate progress.

Find The Dark Wheel, Find Raxxla.
