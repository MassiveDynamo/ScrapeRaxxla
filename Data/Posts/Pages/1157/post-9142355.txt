Trashed anaconda and crashed anacondas are littering the area by the SDOs (scattered disk objects). There are Threat 3 signal sources all over the outer edges. I don't have time to investigate more now. My working theory for unlocking this 1) doesn't appear FSS ever 2) the ancient probes discovered it 3) I think the probes in game are Voyage 1, Voyager 2, and New Horizons. I think we have to datalink scan the probes to get the location of Raxxla within the system. This would also fit nicely with the early discovery and rumors re: Raxxla. It also might just explain the Federation's generalized paranoia about anything Thargoid related. This started far earlier than the official story suggests. Earth and now Mars prayed this would disappear and never resurface but got the shock of the their lives when the Mars Artifact was discovered. Oh and there is the bit that there are two unregistered comms beacons in Sol that tie back to the deeper Thargoid mysteries.





The New Horizons mission had the expressed purpose of exploring the outermost bodies of the solar system. It would explain the early rumors (starting at the very dawn of human expansion). It would also explain the just tons of trashed anacondas in the system (i.e. something out there would prefer to remain undisturbed).

Could it be a possibility....
