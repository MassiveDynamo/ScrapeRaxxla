Thanks, that’s some good logical reasoning and referencing, the article gives a good indicator of where to find it, yet another reason to be in the Sol system.

*Edit: So it’s confirmed as ‘Ancient probe’ and was found, maybe of relevance, but who knows,

Forgive my credulousness, I gave up on taking Galnet seriously several years ago, one of the biggest issues in ED is trusting it’s own sources enough to invest your time in them, especially if that source was originally intended to be a key and trusted resource towards finding things but ultimately became diluted with filler and fluff which didn’t physically relate to what’s was in the game, and casting actual very good intelligence into disrepute (something that FD seem to have only recently acknowledged as being a problem).

This is doubly painful if your a sporadic player like myself, who ends up chasing windmills, but I agree with you, that it’s out there and needs to be located.

*Edit: I’ll go back to sleep.
