Also, @Spaceman Spiff , just curious if there are any obvious commonalities among the systems you are seeing these signals in? Same star type, or political allegiance or the like?

If you wanted to share them and put a Google doc up, I'd be happy to try to contribute when I am back in the Bubble and playing again. Currently out near Hesperus and my playing time has been sidetracked by the evil that is Disco Elysium.
K gang,
For anyone wanting to hop on-board the research train.... here's my tracking sheet for what I've got so far on the "Mysterious Signals". If the "Other Observations" column isn't enough, feel free to add on whatever else you think makes sense.

Happy 'splorin!

"the evil that is Disco Elysium." hahaha
