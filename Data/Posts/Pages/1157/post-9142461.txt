So someone confirmed New Horizons was added with Horizons. This was right at the same time of the missions for The Dark Wheel disappearing. I have some ideas on how the mechanics changed. This isn't being chunked yet. I think this is how they redid the Raxxla puzzle. The New Horizons probe was added right as they added Horizons DLC and that is humanities only mission that was specifically targetting the TNOs/KBOs/SDOs. This is going to have fail there being a game mechanic added with Horizons. Raxxla may have been there since the origin of the game but but they changed where the clues are (and I sincerely doubt Raxxla was moved -- just the clues).
