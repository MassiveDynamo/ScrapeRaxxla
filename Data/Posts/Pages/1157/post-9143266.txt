LS on Thursday, on Twitter they are asking for Qs, this one popped up, totally irrelevant to the subject and the guest ofc but can anyone confirm that this was said at some point? As in remember who said it or provide a link?

Can you confirm the information that was revealed in an earlier recording, in which a developer, possibly you, asked another developer, "can you still get to Raxxla in the default sidewinder? Well, provided you have a fuel scoop, you might need that."
