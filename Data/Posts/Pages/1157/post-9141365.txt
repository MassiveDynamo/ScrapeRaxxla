So this is something you are seeing in the Nav Panel?

Not yet at least. In the upper right notification panel I see notification of new unidentified signal. I haven't been fast enough at stopping the ship to see it in the navigation panel. Unlike most systems Sol doesn't have these all over. I guess next option is to try to locate it via FSS or go to the navigation beacon and get a full download of the system and attempt to lock on via navigation panel so I can drop in on it.
