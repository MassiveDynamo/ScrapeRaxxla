(alternatively could have been there since the beginning and FDev got tired and forced the issue). This was several months before Horizons DLC would drop.

So, my take on the whole thing...

New Horizons mission launch happened in 2006 but wasn't set for the big rendevous with Pluto and Charon until 2015 (launch happened on 1/19/2006 -

). I have a sneaking suspicion this has been there since beginning for the following reasons:

Date of New Horizons GALNET - 13th April, 3304 (2015)
Date of New Horizons Flyby of Pluto/Charon: July 14, 2015, 11:49:57 UTC ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Horizons )

New Horizons probe has been there since Day 1 - it was announced several months before Pluto rendevous to drum up marketing for the AS YET UNANNOUNCED Horizons Season Pass.
