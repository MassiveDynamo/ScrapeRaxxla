Also, @Spaceman Spiff , just curious if there are any obvious commonalities among the systems you are seeing these signals in? Same star type, or political allegiance or the like?

If you wanted to share them and put a Google doc up, I'd be happy to try to contribute when I am back in the Bubble and playing again. Currently out near Hesperus and my playing time has been sidetracked by the evil that is Disco Elysium.
Honestly haven't taken the time yet to really dig into those details. I will put up a GoogleDoc sometime over the next few days, and you can feel free to add whatever categories of distinction you see fit.

Could be comets. They share the icon with Concentrated Signal sources, but are very close(same) to the clusters in frequency.
I wouldn't say no... definitely a contributing possibility in my mind. I wouldn't guess that they are all comets though.... just a few of them, if I hadda guess.
