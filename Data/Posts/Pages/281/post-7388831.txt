I still think there is something to be said for Lyras Song, when you look at the image for Raxxla on the codex it's a question mark over the galaxy map, there are a number of bright systems shown and the borders of two neighboring regions. Now is it just me or does the most prominent area of those two connecting borders match up with the Lyras Song region?

My first post here! I think it's a quality lead Jaymundo. I would check it out, but I'm trying to finish up my theory. Let us know how it goes. Or I can check it out in a week or so.

I also subscribe to TDW toast as a map theory. Although I'm starting to think it just describes how TDW doesnt know where Raxxala is. Here are my results.

For the first portion. I interpreted it as zeta cassiopeia. So I went there, and the jewel I found was cupids arrow. It shines bright there but still looks like a single point. So I went to the tourist beacon. To my surprise, the tourist beacon suggests you visit maia. So at that point I thought I had satisfied the first portion of the toast. I had visited a jewel and received instructions on the next step.

"The whisperer in witch space, the siren of the void". I really didn't know how to interpret this. I dont know if the witchspace sound had ever been audibly analyzed. But thargoids hang out in witchspace, I figured it was as good a place as any to start. So I took off for the maia black hole, nothing interesting in its tourist beacon, but was given a tip off mission during the 20 minute ride there. It was to find a black box from a nearby system with no unique name. I found the black box from a threat 8 thargoid attack, turned in the mission, but nothing else.

It seemed like everything I had done had been connected, but there has been no sort of confirmation that the first two steps worked, and I have no idea how to continue on.
