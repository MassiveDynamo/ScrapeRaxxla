Are these three weekly tip off missions, by chance, different each time? Are they all related to strange corporate matters? There used to be very few such planetary settlements which would yield information by scanning data points, Rawat Depot could have been the only one.

Yes, they are - different places and different messages (except one, which was a duplicate message, but different place), all related to strange corporate matters... regarding embezzlement, blackmailing etc.
Scanning the data cores gave me 1m to 1.6m credits each.

The last 3 Tip Offs for example led me to:

Svarogich 3a - Lat. 2,15 / Lon. -84,56 where, as it turned out, Barnes Landing is located
Hip 12248 5a - Lat. 5,63 / Lon. 150,64 which is the location of Blackman Silo
Inktehit A2 - Lat. 8,98 / Lon. -74,54 - Gamow Base

Djabara and Hip 1742 were also among the Tip Off systems.

Most of them are located within a small bubble of maybe 100(?) ly... don't know the exact value, but they are close together.

I know that Tip Offs used to be different. Maybe two years ago I investigated quite a few of them (maybe 10 or so).
Visited one of the old places today, which I still have bookmarked, and the crashed ship isn't there any more.
Not 100% sure about that, but I think that in the past it was possible to visit the locations (but not scan the data core) even without receiving any Tip Offs.
