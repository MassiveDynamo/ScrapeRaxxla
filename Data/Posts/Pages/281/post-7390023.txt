"The whisperer in witch space, the siren of the void". I really didn't know how to interpret this. I dont know if the witchspace sound had ever been audibly analyzed. But thargoids hang out in witchspace, I figured it was as good a place as any to start. So I took off for the maia black hole, nothing interesting in its tourist beacon, but was given a tip off mission during the 20 minute ride there. It was to find a black box from a nearby system with no unique name. I found the black box from a threat 8 thargoid attack, turned in the mission, but nothing else.

I’ve said it before, & I’ll say it again, especially if your interpretation of the first clue led you to Maia, but whisperer in witchspace, siren of the void could imply either UA or UP.
