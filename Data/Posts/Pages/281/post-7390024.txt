The milky way itself has absorbed other, smaller galaxies (see f.e. here). I don't know, if the absorbed galaxies had the same origin as the milky way (which could be, as they must have been close enough to have been absorbed). On the other hand ,,mother'' could mean ,,actual caring for'' like a ,,Leih-Mutter" (surrogate mother) cares for children not of her own. Could it have this meaning in English? (I'm german ;-)

Your guess is as good as mine on this point!
