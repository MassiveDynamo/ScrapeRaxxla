[...]not fully convinced by the “English language thing” and “mother of galaxies”, and I’m an Englishman. You might say that black holes in general might be mothers of galaxies if they are actually white holes and generate said multiple galaxies. I tend to be a bit pedantic and would say either galactic mother for one galaxy, or mother of galaxies if she had produced one or more.[...]

The milky way itself has absorbed other, smaller galaxies (see f.e. here). I don't know, if the absorbed galaxies had the same origin as the milky way (which could be, as they must have been close enough to have been absorbed). On the other hand ,,mother'' could mean ,,actual caring for'' like a ,,Leih-Mutter" (surrogate mother) cares for children not of her own. Could it have this meaning in English? (I'm german ;-)
