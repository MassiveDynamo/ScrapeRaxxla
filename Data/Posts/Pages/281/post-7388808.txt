If gravity is the mother, may it be visible? How? By a superclusters? Where are this things placed on the our sky? On the our game sky? I hope you can understand what I want to say.

You can not see it, but feel it - see log 4/4

SPOILER

I'm not fully convinced that gravity is meant with 'mother of galaxies', but I do like the idea.
Also in my opinion 'siren in the deepest void' would fit to the description of the invisible neutron star in the conflux delta logs quite well.

Something different.... regarding the Tip Offs...
I think it was @Thatchino who asked the question whether those Tip Offs mentioned 'wake supression' - no, by now they did not.
But in general they seem to have changed. In the past they led to different unrelated(?) crash sites and were often bugged, giving no messages at all or were sometimes non findable/existant.
The ones I got in the past 3 weeks are all related to the same topic. And they all led me to existing planetary low, medium or high security settlements and not to crash sites any more.
Unfortunately Tip Offs seem to be limited to 3 per week...grrrrr... at least this is the impression I got.

Will try my best to keep you informed and uninformed at the same time @Scytale and @Cmdd_Legendie
