Always remember Lawd because of this Galnet - gold rush post, at the time it felt very much like, everyone look at this, now!

I didn’t because I felt it fluff, plus I wasn’t into mining. So it made me curious at the time why a Galnet post was instigated.

In the spirit of the time if we accept that it wasn’t fluff, what was all the hub-bub at that time regards this system?

If there is no conclusion, maybe this can be utilised towards a question to a Dev, next time their taking a QA; eg regard xxx Galnet post of xxx what was the resolution of that story and is it still active, is it linked to the fact that xxx is an impossible star, which would outshine our own etc?

Or Thargod forbid we log it as a bug? Not that would resolve anything!
