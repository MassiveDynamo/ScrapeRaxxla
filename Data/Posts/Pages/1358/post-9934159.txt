I always pictured the swirling stars
Always thought it was a reference to some nebula, cause stars are formed in them and the galaxies were spawned by collapsing giant stars that expelled all the material and formed central black holes.
So nebulae, even the small ones in our galaxy, are the mothers of galaxies in a way.
