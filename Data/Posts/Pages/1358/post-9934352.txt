LAWD 26?
This one?
Gliese 293 B / Wolf-Rayet Star

Which shouldn't exist either?
Yes, for a long time Ive vociferously pointed out the sheer oddity of LAWD 26 in ED. WR stars are extremely bright. IRL Gamma Velorum (permit locked & reputedly the Guardians home star) is over 1000ly away and can still be seen by naked eye. Gliese 293 B is the second star in LAWD 26, though since its so huge its where your fsd drops you into system. IRL if this were truly a WR then it would outshine our sun; Sol would have two sources of daylight! It is strange that this starlight is not implemented in-game.

Now David Braben claimed to be keen on scientific accuracy (see my FD Quotes thread) and was also personally into astronomy (I still think the Andromeda Galaxy in-game is his own amateur astropic). So how come LAWD 26 is implemented in this way in-game? It would definitely be “the jewel on the brow of the mother of galaxies”, the latter of course being Mother Gaia (the phrasing of which in itself is a bit of a giveaway).

The question is whether, being so obvious, this is a real clue or just another red herring! Ive looked in-system (including for comets) and not found anything (though that doesn't mean there’s nothing to find!) and I’ve also tried to fit it into the first line of the toast. Ive fruitlessly jumped and WD boosted several times between that & Sirius (clearly one possible Whisperer due to their fsd expertise).....
