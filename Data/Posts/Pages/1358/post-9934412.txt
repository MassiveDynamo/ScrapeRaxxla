True I accept that, just looking at possibilities for us to gather more data, the glaring reality is that FDs founder was/is very much into astronomical realism, they hired a PHD doctorate, yet still we have an impossible star, so close to Sol, its SO obvious yet everyone just excepts?

It potentially would be easy to fix, although does this just fall into the same box as all the other glaringly obvious bugs which FD has (in only a few instances) noted they won’t fix, because it doesn’t warrant the time/effort.

This is what breaks immersion for me.
I gave up on expecting immersion a long time ago. It’s only the quest for raxxla that keeps me going.
It’s such a shame. I think MB was really behind the storylines, as you’d expect with an author in the game producer role, but that seems to have been lost with his departure & exacerbated by the influx of commercial backing. Recent storyline developments have been good (Adamastor, INRA, Salvation & now the Ever Nearer -but she’s taking her time - Far God), but it’s all eventually focussed on the pew pew..I’m hoping the new “let’s talk to the Thargoids” line takes off cos I’m fed up & bored with the “let’s shoot it” brigade.
I’m really hoping Starfield has a story!!

Oh, sunshine outside! torrential rain dried up for a short while, just finishing early coffee, time for a quick walk with the copawlot...
