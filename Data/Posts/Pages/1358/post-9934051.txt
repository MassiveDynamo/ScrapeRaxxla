Currently chasing the whale(s) at 778c ("and rising..."), but don't seem to be making any progress....

Edit: At 1,210c now and can see it move every now and again, in a very small stutter jump forward (not a smooth animation at all). Not sure if it is supposed to be parallax or it is actual movement or both.
