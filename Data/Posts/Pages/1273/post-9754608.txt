I've been thinking a lot about the 'Thargoid Map Rooms' and the 'Spiralling Stars'.

TL : DR - I got nuthin'!

I was wondering if anyone had 'followed the trail' of 'Thargoid map rooms to see whats at the end, or plotted the locations of the Map Rooms - mainly because I wondered if the Spiraling Star map correlates to the the locations of the Thargoid Map sites. And if so, where the centre of the spiral falls? And whats there?

My best (and obvious) guess would be The Bloop (Barnards Loop).

But that's a lot of 'ifs' and a lot of work!

IIRC
(not my map, see credits in image) provides the means of locating new Thargoid map sites by referencing the current Thargoid location against Merope (on the left) and another known system (Col 70 something? It's permit locked, and related to the Thargoid systems, Google Fu is letting me down right now).

Has anyone followed that 'trail' to either end yet?

Hmm. nevermind, I just found the
which would appear to render all of my rambling in this post irrelevant.

Looks like the're all clustered around the Hyades/Pleiades region in a globular fashion.

Ach, back to the clue-board.

The map may be related yet but I cannot prove it yet. I am essentially working on getting a firm understanding of what transpired between 2097 - 2296. As of now, hyperspace is a viable lore explanation with official backing per Delta Pavonis' "Early Colonies" beacon. That means between 2230 - 2296 humanity at least had moderate access to early hyperspace technology. We really need a more solid foundation for what happened between the first generation ship (2097 - Mayflower 97) and knowing that Raxxla rumors solidly exist (2296).
