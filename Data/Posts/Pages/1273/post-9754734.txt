Yes, I seem to remember that was the instruction sheet for how to use UAs, UPs and ULs; it was a long time ago!

I think the first thing to check out is whether all the thargoid machine spiralling star displays are identical (most likely, but needs to be checked, for science!), or whether they are different (which might well be significant). There should be a few YT vids on these, which might save some time.
I got claustrophobia looking at just one, when they were first discovered!
