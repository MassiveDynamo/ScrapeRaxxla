When you received the rank was there anything out of the ordinary or was it the same progression process as with other ranks?
No, nothing special. Just the access to SD. But it was ages ago (before Horizon I think). I don't think the badge (combat) showed up in the inbox, many of those things were bugged back then. I think only my next rank (trading) showed up properly in the inbox a year later or so.
