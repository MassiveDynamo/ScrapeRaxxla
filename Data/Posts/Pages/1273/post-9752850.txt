Well there was at some point a removal of duplicate named systems that was causing bugs when targeted.

It's likely this system was included in that.

Even if the names weren't identical, the fact it was very similar and bugged might have gotten it included in that duplicate system removal...

Otherwise yea, idk... I doubt it was removed on its own tho, likely with other systems, or possibly just renamed to not search with the old name... so it could be in a generalized patch note about system names corrected, or duplicates being fixed/removed.... who knows...
