Question: What systems do we have where both Barnacles and Guardian structure exist?
Do we have any such systems, where we know Thargoids & Guardians fought over control?

The only system I know of is where I just was taking a look around the other day...

Trapezium Sector YU-X c1-2

there is a single planet in that system, with Human, Guardian and Thargoid sites... though I didn't look at all bio sites, so not sure if Barnacles are present specifically

very curious I must say, but I have yet to draw any solid conclusions beyond the very real possibility it was a place where somthing not so nice happened .... I dont want to spoil anything but
