If the Dark Wheel toast were to refer to commodities (I don't want you to believe it, but just imagine 2 minutes), what could it be? My knowledge of the commodities is very limited, I would appreciate a little help.
For the jewels that shine on the forehead of the mother of all galaxies!
Mother of all galaxies = nothingness, void
void jewels = Void Opal [Mining]
For the one who whispers in the confines of hyperspace, the siren of nothingness!
Thargoid whispers in the confines of hyperspace. Thargoid heart? [Combat]
The mourning of a parent, the sadness of a lover,

Not convinced by your hypothesis re Alleged Toast= commodities,
but intrigued by the hypothesis that "Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars" implies Thargoids (they're all female & young queen insects might be princesses) and the Thargoid Base machine display does show spiralling stars. Think someone else has mooted this hypothesis before but can't remember who or if anyone investigated.
It would mean that this is MB's "We did look at a story involving Raxxla, but felt that was a story that should be played out in game rather than as a novel‚Äù- Raxxla may be intimately connected (stop sniggering at the back there!) with the Thargoid/Guardian storyline. We know that Raxxla is part of the Alien Background lore document.

Has anyone checked to see if all these machine displays are identical??
I've been away for a while, but I was intrigued by the possible link of Thargs & Guardians.
Hence, I had to check some of my old notes.

I may diverge from the Tharg/Guardian link for a bit, as I forgot that I had some notes on the "Mother of galaxies".
I just want to leave it here in case someone has a better idea for followup for a possible lead.

Old flashback to Andromedae as part of the Mother of Galaxies through the whole "strella and the astrophil" discussions a couple of years ago.
In summary
If Andromedae is Mother of Galaxies
Saffar may be the jewel

Jewel: Upsilon Andromedae b, Saffar
How Saffar got it's name, here, and relation to the star: https://www.iau.org/news/pressreleases/detail/iau1514/
Upsilon Andromedae b, wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upsilon_Andromedae_b
Which is coined as Saffar, wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Saffar_(planet)&redirect=no

Sorry for the break, now lets try to find some more credible links between Guardians & Thargoids.
