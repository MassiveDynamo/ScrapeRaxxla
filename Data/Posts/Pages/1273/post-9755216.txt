O7 on the Elite rank Cmdr.

When you received the rank was there anything out of the ordinary or was it the same progression process as with other ranks?

I ask because I fell upon this 5 year old Q/A with DB where he discusses the Elite: Dangerous identifiers and what he ‘wanted’ it to mean, and in particular the mention of a test!

I suspect, like much of what DB discussed / proposed about the game, was based upon very early concepts pre-launch, and what we eventually got was some trimmed down variant.

I’m still at ‘Deadly’ which is where I’m happy to be as it’s the rank I achieved in the 84 game, I’m in no hurry to grab Elite, I know I could grind it out but I’d like it to be a natural progression.
