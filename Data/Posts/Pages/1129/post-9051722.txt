Personally Id be gutted, even if it was me who found it, all those decades of mystery gone, regardless of what it unlocks or whatever it is.
Interesting... I'd be a little sad, of course, but that would be outweighed by excitement!

From Clavian:
"Could be all sorts of things. Among them:
a way of interacting with Thargoids via Thargoid or Guardian tech there
contact with a Guardian ark and appearance of Guardians in game
a new means of travelling via hyperspace
a portal to another region (locked permit sectors perhaps?) to explore
a portal to a brand new galaxy to explore"
My money's on this one... I have complete faith in FDev! They won't let us down!
