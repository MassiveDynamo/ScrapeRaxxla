Little bit of advice - stay on target, main problem I’ve encountered with Raxxla is that there are so many variants and influences it’s difficult not to get distracted. See it out to the end and follow your evidence, don’t get distracted by the various influences out there which will only muddy the waters and take you down some rabbit hole.
I tried to just let the evidence lead me and try to get the best match that would link to in-game locations. I intend to follow up (as in go to the key systems) once the Odyssey alpha is over see where this leads. Expect a post early next week detailing the regions of the galaxy involved and next steps. More details soon.

P.S. - If the calculations agree with where the Alleged Toast points (based upon the map from Achilles' shield) I may even organize an expedition for the entire community of interested Raxxla/TDW seekers.
