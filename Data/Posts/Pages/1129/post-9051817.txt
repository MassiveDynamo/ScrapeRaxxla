Anyone seen today's GalNet? Not as good as MB me thinks Seems a strong possibility theres at least one LP that may be undiscovered and one Gen Ship out there somewhere as well....
Cool - simulacrae was on that with the whispered phrase quote I think, although I didn't realize it was in today's Galnet. It sounds very similar to what happened to some of the ships sent out to the Formidine Rift and elsewhere to setup beacons perhaps also (IIRC some of their crews went mad hearing voices?)
