The dark wheel doesn't know the location of raxxla. No living human does or the DW would have found it.

Finding raxxla isn't going to lead to the dark wheel headquarters or vice versa because they're in the same search as all of us. They're as close to finding it as we are.

The only thing hinted at in the game is about the dark wheel's location. Not raxxla's. They're no closer linked currently than finding the location of you or me based on the idea that we're both looking for raxxla.
Sooo... that's completely speculative as well. Why/how do you know the Dark Wheel hasn't found it? Are you one of them?!?

Also: Raxxla symbol in the Codex... that's not a clue?

Also: (and I say this in the nicest way possible) I think you may be in the wrong channel? I will respectfully retract that if I have misunderstood something....
