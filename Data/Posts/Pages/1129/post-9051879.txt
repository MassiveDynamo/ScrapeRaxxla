Could be all sorts of things. Among them:
a way of interacting with Thargoids via Thargoid or Guardian tech there
contact with a Guardian ark and appearance of Guardians in game
a new means of travelling via hyperspace
a portal to another region (locked permit sectors perhaps?) to explore
a portal to a brand new galaxy to explore
&c. &c.

Thank you for your reply.
But I didn't mean a specific thing, but a way to achieve it.
The translation must have distorted everything.
For example, this is a portal, I am a newcomer to play a little, I go to the wiki, read that this portal is there, and fly there. Finish.
And then I think about what this entry in the codex ?
By understanding this we can get closer to the solution!
