No, i dont care about the dark wheel toast. But the lore people are creating around the assumption that it has to do with raxxla. A neat treasure map that statistically given the number of stars , would be impossible to orchestrate unless all of these required local cultural stories and perspective of earth at a given time were taken into consideration.

And yes, it's possible Fdev went incredible uncreative here, threw out any notion of a believable game lore ... but i doubt that or it would be too easy to find raxxla. And fdev doesn't want anyone to find raxxla until fdev is ready for people to find raxxla - which is never if they're considering the benefits vs the cons.
This wasn't easy. I got lucky as hell with the Alcman's Cosmogenic Fragment. Also, I just tried to look at ways I could relate things that matched the myth vs in-game + known game mechanics that would lead there if this really has been in the game since the early alphas and betas prior to release. The calculations literally was a sort of "Eureka!" moment where suddenly I realized the connection between the eagles sent by Zeus from opposite ends of the world and why they were mentioning it along with a discredited story.
