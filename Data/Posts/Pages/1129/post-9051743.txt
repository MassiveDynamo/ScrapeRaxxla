My money's on this one... I have complete faith in FDev! They won't let us down!

Definitely a very long shot, but if they are really saving it for true end-game content, perhaps it will be a portal that will open the way to a successor game to Elite Dangerous in another galaxy. Elite Dangerous: Andromeda perhaps. Err, that might not be the best example.
