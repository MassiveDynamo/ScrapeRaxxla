Or they could go with the whole magic "jump to these locations in this order and a magic jump will occur that takes you to raxxla" method they've used in the past. But i highly doubt they'll go with a means of discovery that is only effective 1 time for something like raxxla in a multiplayer shared game.

I didn't realize that this had actually been employed in the game in the past? When did they use it?
