Ya my problem is im always convinced the shiny thing is raxxla...

Edit - speaking of which: "They describe how a whispered phrase from an uninhabited planet somehow caused over 17,000 people to slaughter each other. Nobody knows if it was mass hysteria, psychological stress from decades in space, or… something else.”

Maybe time to try playing with the wandering planet connect the dots again....

I just discovered two interesting
lore-based tourist beacons that I was not aware of with possible pointers to interesting non-Raxxla things I may need to check out now. Sigh.

Might be worth checking out the list of rogue planets in-game that is somewhere in the Threadnought if it still exists, which I posted a while back, and checking them out again now that they can be mapped. I'm about to be in the middle of something else offline for a while but I will take a look later today and see if I can find that post. There were only a few of the dozen or so known rogues in-game IIRC.
