You see Polaris became the North star in 510 AD/CE (the same time the Greek civilization became really established) and will remain the closest bright star to the north celestial pole for another 2,000 years ( https://usm.maine.edu/planet/it-true-vega-will-be-our-next-north-star ) due to precession of the equinoxes. Polaris fits in every possible way as it was the ancient North Star and still is the most recognizable bright star that is closest to the northern celestial pole.

I have been looking at the poles idea too - But I am looking a bit further into the past. Just using Holdstocks ideas as a guide - He indicates contact happend around the time of the building of the pyramids -so around 2500 BC. Polaris was not the pole star then. Thuban was. Thuban being in Draco and a big snake.... But I like the idea of Trojan war as a metaphor - they are definitely using things like that. Of course Im thinking of it being compared to a change in religious approaches from the Mother Goddess to Sky God as a hint that Thargoids might have been utilizing our planet for bioloogical resources and perhaps the war with the Guardians put an end to it? - and ya the Idea of Raxxla is tied up in that some how. But ya who knows. And ya I agree these "mythological" approaches will probably give us a vauge direction to look at best
