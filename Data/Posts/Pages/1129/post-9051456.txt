Sad to say, I will repeat what I wrote here at the beginning of the year. Imagine if one of the players found/learned what Raxxla was.
What happens next ?
Could be all sorts of things. Among them:
a way of interacting with Thargoids via Thargoid or Guardian tech there
contact with a Guardian ark and appearance of Guardians in game
a new means of travelling via hyperspace
a portal to another region (locked permit sectors perhaps?) to explore
a portal to a brand new galaxy to explore
&c. &c.
