Might be worth checking out the list of rogue planets in-game that is somewhere in the Threadnought if it still exists, which I posted a while back, and checking them out again now that they can be mapped. I'm about to be in the middle of something else offline for a while but I will take a look later today and see if I can find that post. There were only a few of the dozen or so known rogues in-game IIRC.

Actually it was on this thread, not the Threadnought, and at that time only one seemed to be in game: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/page-42#post-6033937

There might be an earlier post with the list of rogues here or on the Threadnought (pretty sure that was where it first came up but memory, first to go, etc. etc.), but I am pretty sure I used this list and checked them all in Simbad for all designations and checked all of those against the Galaxy Map: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_planet

But I may also have given up checking all the Simbad designations also, not sure.
