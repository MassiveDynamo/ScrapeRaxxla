I totally agree; I am of course playing devils advocate.

I would concede it is actually discoverable - as I outlined in my own findings…

Yet it is evident that from 2016/2017 something changed. I suspect they altered something. So I don’t think we can rely on the historical statements…none of which actually state it’s accessible… those statements in my opinion actually allude to a past and now dropped narrative… it’s an unknown, that is suspicious, yes I know it’s pendantic, but it’s an intelligence gap in my opinion which could either set our efforts in concrete, and give us further energy towards finding it, or alleviate our Fernweh.

Yes it is absurd to think, why develop an element 7 years ago, to only narratively lock it for a future experience (Looks at galaxy map, how many locked sectors of space?).

I am simply endeavouring to harvest information out of FD…one never knows what fresh data might fall if you don’t rattle the apple tree once in a while…
