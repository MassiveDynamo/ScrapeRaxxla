I wonder… does FD decision to drop Console support, and effectively focus on the EDO engine, mean that they won’t apply ED narratively across Console and EDH?

For instance, if that’s true and Raxxla is narratively locked, will you need EDO to experience it?
Given that it's been in the game since launch, and has been able to be found by anyone. Why do you think it would be narratively locked?
