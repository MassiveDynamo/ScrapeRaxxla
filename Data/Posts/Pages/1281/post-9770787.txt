I think there are a lot of story lines left undeveloped. Not just the Thargoids. It's obvious something is there's with the region locked areas in/around Barnard's Loop.

But then you have the guardian sites in Norma's Arm with a region locked area associated with those. Some.region locked areas in the Formidine Rift....

And my latest "wild " raxxla theory, '... mother of Galaxies..." = Sag A, then on to the '....siren of the deep' could be Andromeda who was saved from the depths by Perseus.... Well, there are several close region locked areas, "north" of Sag A, in the Perseus Stem! Some what desperate I know, but keeps me entertained

But my serious point is that it is obvious there are many stories still open, under-developed or just forgotten but unfinished!

I think there is also a lot where they are partially developing the groundwork for a story arc for with the intention to expand on it as events unfold that will get people deeper into the galaxy (especially with the Deep Space Support Array (https://fleetcarrier.space/search/dssa) of regional fleet carries) and fleet carriers spreading across the galaxy.

In case you were wondering, there are lots of billionaire CMDRs.
