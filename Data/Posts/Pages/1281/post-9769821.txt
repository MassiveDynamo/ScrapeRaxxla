@Ozric : Strictly speaking Rochester is perfectly correct, we have no confirmation that Raxxla is accessible!
Though the participants in this thread operate on hope!!!

My signature links to my thread containing useful links to FD statements...
DB has said to Drew Wagar that Raxxla is in game.
DB confirmed on record (livestream) that Raxxla is in-game (but we dont know what it is).
MB said (DJtruthsayer interview) Raxxla is in the Milky Way, it’s a personal journey and you have to make some of it a little bit obvious so people know what they’re doing (edit: wish that were true!!). Also (elsewhere) that it is a definite place, and can be found by more than one player.

(Edit: if you have a reference for the “it is accessible” then please tell & I’ll add it to the quotes thread)

There is an unsubstantiated report by Ascorbius that MB said that the system containing Raxxla had been visited and honked but Raxxla was not discovered. If true this might discredit the rumour that Raxxla is somehow locked away from discovery in an unknown permit system like Polaris (though some systems were locked fairly late after some had already been visited in-game, e.g. around Col70); I asked a CM to check this rumour with MB and got the response that MB would not comment.

So, we Quest and tilt at Raxxla-shaped windmills in the hope that we stand a chance of finding it, at least until Horizons dies on PC the death that DB’s “console update” message seems to imply....
