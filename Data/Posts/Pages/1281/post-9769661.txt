Do you have confirmation that’s ‘accessible’. Please enlighten?

There is an assumption that the DW is narratively locked. Because FD were asked if the DW faction and theoretical invite was currently accessible, and FD did respond saying that, certain factions and invites/permits were not currently active…

I take that to indicate that there does exist some future narratively lock content….be it Raxxla, the real DW or something else. If FD are not going to focus upon EDH code (as I understand it), then would said future content need EDO to interact with it… whenever that is… or is says content ‘currently’ - accessible’?
Like with most things, things degrade over time and so finding of things like the lore interview Michael Brookes did with DJ Truthsayer back in 2016/17 are very hard. But there are references to both David Braben and Mike Brookes confirming it is in game and accessible.
Raxxla
Cora comes home soused and raving with wild stories, a new one every night. She claims she's found a map to some pirate stash, and all I have to do is loan her my ship so we can go dig it up. Maybe we should go find Raxxla while we're at it! — From the journal of Art Tornqvist, circa 2296 Raxxla...

If it narratively locked, why would FD wait 7 years to unlock it?
