I think there was a hint in "Console update" post, David Braben said "We need to be able to move forward with the story of the game, and in order for us to do this we need to focus on a single codebase." I think they may finally unlock The Dark Wheel quest.
In my opinion DB is referencing the EDO story, aka the Azimuth and emergence of Thargoids on foot combat.

EDO has stalled for a year, that means the Azimuth storyline has stalled too, they have held back as long as they can, but they have to release the remaining content of EDO as a season, and I suspect the emergence of Thargoids on legs is tied directly into the Azimuth saga.

If the DW or Raxxla is unfortunately narratively tied to EDO that would be regrettable, but at least relief that it was imminent!

AT did reference Raxxla in his ‘Channel 4’ skit saying it was just around the corner. And AT use of words in the ‘Pilot’ interview that of ‘the pay off’ etc was the same term he used relatively regards the Azimuth in the same interview…a thin link but maybe, let’s hope so.
