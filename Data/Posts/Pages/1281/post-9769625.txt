Given that it's been in the game since launch, and has been able to be found by anyone. Why do you think it would be narratively locked?
Do you have confirmation that’s ‘accessible’. Please enlighten?

I presume there is a reasonable level of doubt to inform it could be narratively locked. Based upon FD modus operandi and that absence of any evidence to show it is currently accessible.

I however also want to believe it is accessible.

There is an assumption that the DW is narratively locked. Because FD were asked if the DW faction and theoretical invite was currently accessible, and FD did respond saying that, certain factions and invites/permits were not currently active…

I take that to indicate that there does exist some future narratively lock content….be it Raxxla, the real DW or something else. If FD are not going to focus upon EDH code (as I understand it), then would said future content need EDO to interact with it…

This is obviously my very obvious attempt to obtain proof that yes Raxxla is currently ‘accessible’. There is to date zero evidence to prove it can be experienced… yes it’s in game… but so technically is ‘future locked/narrative content’.

There is an element of doubt which needs resolution.
