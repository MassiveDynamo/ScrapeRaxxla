I got a similar thing about mission detected, but I didn't follow it. I couldn't find any sights. I probably should have visted the beacon. Can't remember where it happened. It was a different system.

Also didn't have a ship with an srv.

Are you elite in exploration or anything? Maybe mission pop up like this after you get elite status in various areas.
