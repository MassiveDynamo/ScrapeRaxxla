Aren't we forgetting the potential of clones. The Dark Wheel book involved the clone planet. That might explain part of this. Edit: probably not. There are 31 or 32 names in the first two galaxies. Unless there are more in the other ones I haven't gone over yet.
Elite: The Dark Wheel
It even names the clone planet.



Could he mean to remember Raxxla? What if those words are the systems from the original game that exist in ED?
That sounds like the Qoute from the book linked above where it jason is told to remember Raxxla!


Are these just shuffled names for planets or systems? Or are they something like peoples playe names who have visited Raxxla mixxed up.
