From Drews Stream:

Salome is not related to Raxxla
The dots in the eyes are irrelevant
Drew doesn't know where Raxxla is
"I do not believe that Raxxla and the Rift are connected (though I can't rule it out as I do not know where Raxxla is, or even what it is - I suspect that may be a truly 'endgame' item for ED). Certainly Raxxla is nothing to do with me." - Drew Wagar (emphasis mine)
