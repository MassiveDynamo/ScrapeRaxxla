So my digging around Kwatis system came up blank. Mostly. I was digging around C3 A and kept getting guardian site music. Twice I got music that was new to me, similar vibe to the g.site music though. At one point 2 ships flew past me, scanned me, then went a few km over and just started hovering off the ground and looking at the same point. I did a loop and found that they were pointed at a small camp thing. Scanning the beacon gave me a message saying “Listen for anything unusual”. I’ll upload a recording of that later. But the odd thing is that my SRV nav panel picked up a signal from 6Kls away. Sadly I lost the signal when I entered my ship but from the distance I know it came from C8 (eight moon of the star, breathing intensifies). But looking around the planet without a location turned up nothing. Here’s the sc showing what I’m on about.
