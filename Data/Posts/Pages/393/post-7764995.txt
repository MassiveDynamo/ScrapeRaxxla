Flying around the Kwatis system after reading the reddit thread. Randomly got a update :"Mission Objective Detected." to go to a degraded emissions site. However, I don't currently have any active missions...please don't be a bug...
Happens. I was flying around Sol and got that but it was “Mission Objective: Trading Beacon” Some type 9 was there and gave me a mission to get 80T or something to a nearby star port. Elite rank recommended. Had 4 guys come after who I killed and was given an extra 500Kc for. However even with a full completion it led to nothing. I heard someone say that they heard DB say “follow the missions” but that’s still about as vague as everything else. I’m convinced there is something off about one of the planets in that system though. Like I said in my previous post, I encountered music I’ve never heard as I searched an area but lost the location and the music. And the surface looked...different.
