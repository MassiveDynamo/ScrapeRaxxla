Just picked this up from r/EliteDangerous

The reflection in her eyes is the same as an image that Drew posted a year ago. He's pushing something.
What is she looking at! Star system? Constellation... Orion's Belt?

Edit: It might not be vital, or an INTENTIONAL repetition.. if it is the same picture of Kahina, just in a different light.

Edit: I know that this is now the "wrong thread" since this is more about Salome. Just wanted to pitch that last finding. Moving on
