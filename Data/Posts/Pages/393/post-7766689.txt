I noticed it this morning, very puzzling considering that it's been a long time since she died. wonder if the galaxy is going to finally be a little more fun for change?

Edit: by the way where are all the code breakers and puzzle grand masters when you need them lol
Edit 2: P.S. where did you get that picture cos I can't seem to get a downloadable copy anywhere
Aren't we forgetting the potential of clones. The Dark Wheel book involved the clone planet. That might explain part of this. Edit: probably not. There are 31 or 32 names in the first two galaxies. Unless there are more in the other ones I haven't gone over yet.

My last request is that you always... Remember.
(Thanks Node_ for pointing out the first one was a Z rather than a G )

Right part looks like the output of a more complex encryption, maybe Vigenere.

Could he mean to remember Raxxla? What if those words are the systems from the original game that exist in ED?
That sounds like the Qoute from the book linked above where it jason is told to remember Raxxla!

Are these just shuffled names for planets or systems? Or are they something like peoples playe names who have visited Raxxla mixxed up.
