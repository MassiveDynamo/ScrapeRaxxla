I have seen those 'go to a system and we'll give you more info' assassination missions. Never really paid attention how common or if any particular trigger, just put it down to fluff variation. I think I've had one as a follow up inbox mission too but not sure. (as in full mission in the inbox, not the 'we have put another mission on the board if you look' type message) I think I may have seen them for settlement beacon scanning missions as well, similar, 'We need you to scan a beacon, go to X system for more details' or 'We'll give you more details when you get to X' Have always been wary of them as haven't done many and didn't want a High Sec or one I didn't know what to do with, or worse one 300 Kls from the star. Don't recall them for any other type, but nagging at me is a Salvage one as well but I may have just imagined that or crossed it with something else.

iirc the first assassination one I took needed a planetary scan and I didn't have an SRV so had to go hunting, think this made me more selective before accepting incomplete info ones.

Is it just me or are all the fighter pilots standing around in the hangar bay near the engines all of a sudden? Don't often look as training up my Harmless crew member but every one today had an engine in the background.
