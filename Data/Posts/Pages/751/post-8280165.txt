before the last patch you could get trader elite in a few hours.

Combat elite is still fast-trackable via thargoid scout farming as far as i know.

i think the least exploitable currently is exploration... . though if you skip over to colonia, you can neutron farm like a boss and get it done probably as fast as possible currently.
