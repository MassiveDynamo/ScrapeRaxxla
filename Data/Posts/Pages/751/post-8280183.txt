It could be the opposite, it could be that you have to do 'everything' in the game before anything happens. If you include all unique Codex discoveries and all tradeable goods and rares and all variations of missions that's quite a feat.

I hope not coz I don't trade animal products or slaves of any kind.

And a lot of it has been added since inception so unless the goal keeps changing its unlikely now that I think about it.
