I completed a 4-chain assassination mission thread for Aegis Core over the last few nights vs 'pirates'.

Started as an investment of 1M, then follow-up after follow-up mission progressively getting harder. The last one had me drop into one system, be told it was in another, nothing appeared from Beacon, nor FSS - but in comms I was told to follow a Cobra III as he was 'told to find me' and drop down out of supercruise to normal space where he gave me the intel for the final target which was in-system but only appeared after he provided intel.

It was the Pirate leader for the opposing faction, but I can't say I've had to drop out of supercruise before to get 'personal' intel provided. It's always been via messages, or scanning the beacon when you arrive in a system. If they're not there, jump to the other location and repeat.

This was different... and I quite enjoyed it even if it is just 'fluff'.

I felt like I was following a bit of a story line whilst doing the missions and helping Aegis Core achieve something. So well done FDev even if it doesn't help me get TDW invite!

I have, but only a few different times. Usually as part of chained missions iirc
