so I've heard, but do you have an FD reference source for that?

I know there are triple elites involved in this Quest (e.g. @Macros), but of those has anyone got a perfectly stainless reputation? No slave shipments? No assassination missions? etc? Wondering what is the optimal "personal journey" to interest a band of adventurers, treasure seekers and myth hunters!

Tyko & Jorki are both only double elite, so combat elite might be an obvious next step in my "personal journey".

@Han_Zen. Thanks mate! That journey out to T Lyrae was profitable. Found a few WW unmapped and even some undiscovered. Profit 38, 216,794Cr
Biscuits are on Tyko!

the retconning of previous books and material comes from kickstarter days. There's not one singular source since fdev doesn't specifically say what parts of old written material they are keeping and what they aren't. only that the only "official" fiction is that which is sold on their store post-elite dangreous kickstarter times.
