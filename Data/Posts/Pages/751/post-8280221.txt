His name is on the pic next to the mission thing. Patrician Mario Castro.



Did you take into acount the sun/mainstar. It does not show up as an FSS but it is counted in the body count I think. Edit: NVM, saw the later post. FSS was gassy. It had a little burp.
He meant the name of the person to be murdered. I say murder specifically because i received a wanted level from the mf that offered the mission upon completing the mission.
