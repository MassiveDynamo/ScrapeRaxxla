Though I have a niggling thought that DB said early on he was surprised nobody had found Raxxla yet, or am I misremembering & that was DW re Zurara??

Drew said about the 'Remember Salome' thread puzzle that he was surprised nobody had solved it yet as it was easier than people thought or similar. Is that what youre thinking of?
