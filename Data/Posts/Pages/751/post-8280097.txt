It would be hard to be an elite 'chef' without breaking some 'eggs'

I checked my stats this evening, Tyko’s got one assassination logged, but no slave shipments (Jorki was a bit more ruthless in getting Trade elite). But there are a lot of stats kept by the game (see codex Cmdr tab); and the three ranks for combat, trade & exploration are obvious, but there’s also System permits, tourist beacons, generation ships & abandoned settlements visited, and a thargoid entry (Tyko only had Cmdr Jameson’s logs here). Makes a bit of a daunting prospect!
