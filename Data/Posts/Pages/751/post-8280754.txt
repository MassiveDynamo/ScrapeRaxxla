No, all NS rotate, at high rates due to conservation of angular momentum from the parent star. The mass of this one is a bit high, but as Han_Zen said it may be in a transition phase. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star
Ok, listened NS lecture again ... extra fast spinning NS may avoid being BH for some time, because being or not BH depends on density inside star. Current models predict easy 3 sol masses.
However, I still doubt about ingame 13 Sols ... as there are speed limits. At some rotation speed:
1. speed can be more then 1st cosmic speed and matter just fly out in space
2. "sound speed" may be more then light speed and then matter gets crazy and unstable.
all depends on initial radius-mass.

Huh, 1 more fun fact, minimal mass of NS must be 15% less then white dwarf, otherwise explosion will do dwarf. So it's around 1.1 SOL to 2.1 SOL. And I see plenty of NS of 0.3-0.6-0.7
