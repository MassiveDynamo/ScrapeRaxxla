so I've heard, but do you have an FD reference source for that?

I know there are triple elites involved in this Quest (e.g. @Macros), but of those has anyone got a perfectly stainless reputation? No slave shipments? No assassination missions? etc? Wondering what is the optimal "personal journey" to interest a band of adventurers, treasure seekers and myth hunters!

Tyko & Jorki are both only double elite, so combat elite might be an obvious next step in my "personal journey".

@Han_Zen. Thanks mate! That journey out to T Lyrae was profitable. Found a few WW unmapped and even some undiscovered. Profit 38, 216,794Cr
Biscuits are on Tyko!

All of my 6 triple accounts have performed mischievous deeds towards triple ascension; none are spotless.
