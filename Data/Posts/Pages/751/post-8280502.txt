All of my 6 triple accounts have performed mischievous deeds towards triple ascension; none are spotless.

Are those also fully Allied with Empire, Federation and Alliance? I was looking at this the other day, and in addition to working on my final Elite for combat, at the same time planning on ramping my Alliance rep.

I've also been investigating the passenger missions for TDW, Aegis Core et al and noted (anecdotally) there seems to be more 'Show me the Universe' style missions where you'll take a passenger to three locations close to, but around the bubble, within ~250ly. There are still the long trips, but these multiple hops are what I've been looking into.

Investigating all these out-of-band it seems like their nudging us to explore all the lore that already exists in the game, rather than relying on non-cannon, or unknown cannon material from the Internet.

Just my 2 cents.
