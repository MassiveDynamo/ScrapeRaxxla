I would say maybe there maybe tidbits of info in that book that may still be relevant. But that's a MAYBE personally i never really read it myself but planning too today.

See if anything comes to mind plus it's the only Elite book I haven't read so there is that.

It's not a bad read. I'm currently re-reading all my Elite books, but only on the third so far
