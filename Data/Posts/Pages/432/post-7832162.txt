Same.

Though I’d say ‘fernweh’ also encompasses not knowing what the specific place is. A ‘looking for something, don’t know quite exactly what it is, but will know it when I find it’ type thing, if you see what I mean.

Yeah, I'd agree with that:

Wanderlust: I'll keep moving
Fernweh: I'll stop when I find it

Of course, it could just be that whoever wrote the Codex just hit a thesaurus and picked a word that sounded cool

Edit:
This is the problem I have with trying to 'solve' Raxxla.
Since we don't know what's a clue and what's not, we end up assuming that everything is a clue, to the point that it'll take us longer to evaluate all the possibilities than it would to fly to every star in the galaxy
