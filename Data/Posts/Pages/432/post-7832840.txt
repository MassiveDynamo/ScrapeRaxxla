My suspicion of the choice of the word 'fernweh' is that it's a word that in 36+years I've never heard before nor read in any books. Yet in definition it's an older language word( unless it's regularly used in germany, which I suspect it isn't).

Why would a game set so far in the future use such an uncommon word that isn't even necessarily relevant today?
Why shouldn’t it?

Various points:

- the word may come into usage

- the word might just be a very good description for what it is

- someone might just be a fan of how different languages have words for things which English doesn’t necessarily have a word for

- someone might be a fan of historical/old language

Not sure where you’re based but if you’re in the UK, you may remember a thing from a few years back where a politician said that people had forgotten the meaning of Habeas Corpus.

How long has Latin been a dead language for?

As another point, is there any reason why the game shouldn’t introduce people to new things (whether words, ideas, concepts, etc)?
