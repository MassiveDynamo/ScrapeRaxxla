It's probably nitpicking, but my reading of fernweh is that it's more targeted than wanderlust. Wanderlust is a desire to travel, whereas fernweh is a desire to be somewhere (else) specific. So if I had an urge to explore China, that would be wanderlust, but a desire to live in Hong Kong would be fernweh.

Vagabond actually fits better with wanderlust than with fernweh, since again it's about having no fixed destination.
Same.

Though I’d say ‘fernweh’ also encompasses not knowing what the specific place is. A ‘looking for something, don’t know quite exactly what it is, but will know it when I find it’ type thing, if you see what I mean.
