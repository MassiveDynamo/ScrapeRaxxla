With triangulation, I wonder if the clue could be in likening the search to el Dorado, prester John and Atlantis?

I still think Fernweh is important somehow though. Otherwise why fernweh, not wanderlust, or any other similar term. This is also the only theme that carries directly to the DW toast, with vagabond
