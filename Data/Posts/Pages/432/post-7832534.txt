You're not wondering why it's called 'Source 2'? Go to Prism system, where all the stars have names, but none of them have additional numbers - so why 'Source 2' and not just 'Source'? Where is 'Source 1'? Is there a 'Destination 2'? That sounds like somewhere interesting to go.

Incidentally, if you go to Prism, don't get over-excited about the star called 'Diamond' - that's definitely a Rift thing.

Edit:
Obviously I mean letters, not numbers, so Source 2 should be Sagittarius A* B, which makes it all the more curious.
Source 2 alludes to the fact that when radio telescopes went to view Sag A* there was 2 large sources of radio waves, not the expected 1 from Sag A*.
