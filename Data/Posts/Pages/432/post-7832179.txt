Since we're talking about asterisms, here's another fun angle - this one regarding the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of all galaxies.

To dig this rabbit hole a lil deeper, Spica/Alpha Virginis is a part of this particular asterism, and is associated by some with Hermes Trismegistus. Fun times.

And yeah, the worst part about this whole hunt is that we don't know what's a lead and what isn't. Hell, we can't even reasonably use the fact that raxxla was supposed to be in since gamma, seeing as it may have been moved in one of the patches to play better with new game features... or locked off behind an unknown permit.

Ahhh, Cor Caroli. I thought that might be a Rift clue too. I swear I'm gonna forget which mystery I'm trying to solve!
