With triangulation, I wonder if the clue could be in likening the search to el Dorado, prester John and Atlantis?

I still think Fernweh is important somehow though. Otherwise why fernweh, not wanderlust, or any other similar term. This is also the only theme that carries directly to the DW toast, with vagabond

It's probably nitpicking, but my reading of fernweh is that it's more targeted than wanderlust. Wanderlust is a desire to travel, whereas fernweh is a desire to be somewhere (else) specific. So if I had an urge to explore China, that would be wanderlust, but a desire to live in Hong Kong would be fernweh.

Vagabond actually fits better with wanderlust than with fernweh, since again it's about having no fixed destination.
