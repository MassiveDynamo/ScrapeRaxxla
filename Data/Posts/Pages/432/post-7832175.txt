Since we're talking about asterisms, here's another fun angle - this one regarding the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of all galaxies.

The great diamond:

To dig this rabbit hole a lil deeper, Spica/Alpha Virginis is a part of this particular asterism, and is associated by some with Hermes Trismegistus. Fun times.

And yeah, the worst part about this whole hunt is that we don't know what's a lead and what isn't. Hell, we can't even reasonably use the fact that raxxla was supposed to be in since gamma, seeing as it may have been moved in one of the patches to play better with new game features... or locked off behind an unknown permit.

EDIT:

"Spica is believed to be the star that gave Hipparchus the data that led him to discover the precession of the equinoxes.[13] A temple to Menat(an early Hathor) at Thebes was oriented with reference to Spica when it was built in 3200 BC, and, over time, precession slowly but noticeably changed Spica's location relative to the temple."

And there's Thebes being mentioned. The plot, it thickens.
