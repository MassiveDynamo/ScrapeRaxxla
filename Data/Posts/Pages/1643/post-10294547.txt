The tree-rune systems are: Purisaz (thorn), Ansuz (oak or ash), Berkanan (birch) and Ehwaz (yew).
These are not concentrated in a particular part of the Bubble.

In your 3D diagram just above showing the Norns and Greek fates, there is a cluster of four purple dots just below the lowest point of the yellow triangle. This is close to the centre of the architecture, so I thought they might be interesting to visit and see what is nearby.
Yeah I think those purple points aren’t grouped like that in game, that grouping is due to perspective from the point of view of the camera.

Regards the Thorn / Tree systems it’s hard to identify what is intentional and what is arbitrary at present because I believe Brookes may have utilised a large number of mythologies and repurposed them. Some may have an important role to play - others may not.

One of my suspicions is he might have applied some type of locational marker system based on Robert Holdstocks ‘Rune of Thorn’ concept, which may also involve other types or trees, from various historical faiths. He may not have.

Many of those systems you’ve named I’ve already plotted. I’m simply looking for a pattern.

At present yes they are fairly well spaced out, but I’m seeing some triangulation; this may simply be pattern bias, or it may not, but I suspect there may be more such systems.

Purisaz (thorn) 96.03 -10.34 46.19
Ansuz (oak or ash) 61.91 5.97 54.53
Berkanan (birch) -19.28 67.56 31.00
Ehwaz (yew) 73.09 -110.25 90.50

Askr (Norse first man or Ash tree) 66.72 67.44 -6.69
Meliae (Greek tree nymph linked to the Ash tree) -17.31 49.53 -1.69

Within the Lost Realms zone there is Futhark (Runic alphabet) 75.34 -119.28 46.44; it holds the system Chuillin which means ‘holy bush’ in German, also in this system is the body Faereal, which might mean ‘fae real’?!

The image below shows these Thorn/Tree systems shown in purple, in relation to the Morrigans, the Norns, Brookes Drabbles and the Mountains.



The second image shows an odd alignment with the Norse Norns and Greek Fates. I’ve plotted their exact centres of the Fates and Norns. From a certain perspective they might seem to align? These may just be establishing Points which identify the ‘boundary’ of Brookes model? Who knows…
