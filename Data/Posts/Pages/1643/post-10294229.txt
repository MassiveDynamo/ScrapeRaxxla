I'll be honest. I really don't see the Oresrian/Klaxxian divide being gone. There is too much lore invested into divides that cause significant long-term problems (see Thargoids reaction to certain things and the whole Guardian civil wars, and the very weird plot twist where the Thargoids turned Proteus Wave against Salvation. I believe we may well get clarification on that sooner than later especially the "Thargoids" are actually caught between humans and something worse. We also had Oresrians in The Dark Wheel novella, Drew Wagar's books, and a mystery 3rd species in the FFE journals. The time is rapidly approaching where the elephant in the galaxy has to dealt with finally. It also wasn't just aliens, you see the same divisions showing up repeatedly in humans. It just wouldn't make sense that this arc is completely abandoned for as much effort was put into it.

They used way too much ink for this story arc to be abandoned. Delayed sure, but not abandoned. This may have even been more to get a much larger amount of the players questioning if the story was as simple as we've been told.

I agree. The Klaxians are still at least an option. They are clearly mentioned in Premonition, which was written well after the so called 'retcon'. The Klaxians are of course mentioned by a character in the book. Characters may tell lies. FD still have the option to add the Kalxians to the game at any point, without needing further explanation.

The 'retcon' was all about the fate of the Alliance efforts to establish diplomatic relations to the Thargoids, in the late 3250s. Pre retcon, this was a partial success. After the retcon, it was changed to a failure. This is confimed by the corrosion damaged Qest ship in Ted Turners basement, in Premonition. Mic Turner or the FFE player character was killed by Thargoids.
