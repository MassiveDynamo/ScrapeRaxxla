especially the "Thargoids" are actually caught between humans and something worse.
The Oresrian / Klaxian divide in itself may well still be there in some form - there are certainly hints in the Azimuth material and elsewhere that the Thargoids seen now are not necessarily the same Thargoids fought in the first war, at least.

This specific thing doesn't work in the context of Elite Dangerous, though - and I think people may have been raising this back when MB was still on the project: the human bubble is a few hundred LY across and human activity outside that zone is extremely sparse and essentially irrelevant. There's no geographically plausible way that the Thargoids could be fleeing something in such a way that they needed to traverse human space to do so, or that whatever was chasing them would need to stop to deal with human space rather than adding perhaps 50 LY onto a multi-thousand LY travel distance to go around it entirely (while making a note to come back for it later, if so inclined).
