This could be a significant indication as to how the Raxxla mystery is structured.
A mystery devised by Braben and constructed by Brookes means it could be extremely technical - far more than any Thargoid or Guardian mysteries we've seen.

It certainly explains why I've been banging my head against aspects of this. So much of it would involve technical knowledge and, because the clues are so ethereal, it is so easy to lose the trail of breadcrumbs whilst also knowing I don't know enough about the subject matter It certainly is a great way to learn about fields of science I wasn't aware of though
For an example of pure raw Brookes, look no further than the Thargoid Probe encoded data: https://canonn.science/codex/unknown-probe/
