The tree-rune systems are: Purisaz (thorn), Ansuz (oak or ash), Berkanan (birch) and Ehwaz (yew).
These are not concentrated in a particular part of the Bubble.

In your 3D diagram just above showing the Norns and Greek fates, there is a cluster of four purple dots just below the lowest point of the yellow triangle. This is close to the centre of the architecture, so I thought they might be interesting to visit and see what is nearby.
