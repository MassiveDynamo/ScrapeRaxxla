There's no geographically plausible way that the Thargoids could be fleeing something in such a way that they needed to traverse human space to do so, or that whatever was chasing them would need to stop to deal with human space rather than adding perhaps 50 LY onto a multi-thousand LY travel distance to go around it entirely (while making a note to come back for it later, if so inclined).
Definitely, but that's assuming only the spatial factor. If we assume the pursuer to be something which would feel compelled to stop and deal with something like humanity then that changes.
Maybe the thargs stop here for some light meta alloy action just to lure things here. Intergalactic timespans might make such an investment worthwhile.

Picture a wave of machines bent on removing intelligent life from the universe.
Or a species out to harvest biomass/ biological distinctiveness.
Or even a race similar to humans which would simply stop to say hello, and which these thargoids have failed to communicate with? Seems to be a common problem with them/ us.
Or something ineffable in other ways. Does it even need explaining if they show up suddenly?

Also they might live in witch space, and who knows how that works?
