The tree-rune systems are: Purisaz (thorn), Ansuz (oak or ash), Berkanan (birch) and Ehwaz (yew).
These are not concentrated in a particular part of the Bubble.

In your 3D diagram just above showing the Norns and Greek fates, there is a cluster of four purple dots just below the lowest point of the yellow triangle. This is close to the centre of the architecture, so I thought they might be interesting to visit and see what is nearby.
Bare in mind Ogham has six different meanings, in England Ash is Nion, Oak is Duir, Birch is Beth, Yew is Idho and with Thorn having no place in Druidry at all.
Also more confusing is that these are Ogham (tree) names whist the Ogham alphabet has different names for each rune, they are not the same.
