And perhaps the saddest footnote:
"We were all set to continue this story, but MB was moved to Jurassic Park in 2017 and after that the Oresrian/Thargoid war story and various other bits of lore were stopped or retconned. It would have been funâ€¦
I'll be honest. I really don't see the Oresrian/Klaxxian divide being gone. There is too much lore invested into divides that cause significant long-term problems (see Thargoids reaction to certain things and the whole Guardian civil wars, and the very weird plot twist where the Thargoids turned Proteus Wave against Salvation). I believe we may well get clarification on that sooner than later especially the "Thargoids" are actually caught between humans and something worse. We also had Oresrians in The Dark Wheel novella, Drew Wagar's books, and a mystery 3rd species in the FFE journals. The time is rapidly approaching where the elephant in the galaxy has to dealt with finally. It also wasn't just aliens, you see the same divisions showing up repeatedly in humans. It just wouldn't make sense that this arc is completely abandoned for as much effort was put into it.

They used way too much ink for this story arc to be abandoned. Delayed sure, but not abandoned. This may have even been more to get a much larger amount of the players questioning if the story was as simple as we've been told.
