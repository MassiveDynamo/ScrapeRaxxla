The "Greek Mythology" page I found interesting based on this comment and how MB worked his clues...
"There’s a lot of Greek mythology and astronomy in Drew’s clues and work. The Thargoid story (by the late, great Michael Brookes) was mostly codes and cyphers, very maths and science. Drew wanted a different route that was more accessible for more players. General knowledge, language puzzles and lateral thinking."

You'll need to read the site for the full context (and how vague/hard it was!), but as I mentioned perhaps a little insight in to the puzzle creation process of MB which is relevant here...
This could be a significant indication as to how the Raxxla mystery is structured.
A mystery devised by Braben and constructed by Brookes means it could be extremely technical - far more than any Thargoid or Guardian mysteries we've seen.

It certainly explains why I've been banging my head against aspects of this. So much of it would involve technical knowledge and, because the clues are so ethereal, it is so easy to lose the trail of breadcrumbs whilst also knowing I don't know enough about the subject matter It certainly is a great way to learn about fields of science I wasn't aware of though
