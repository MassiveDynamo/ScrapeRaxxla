You forgot to mention that Persephone couldn’t leave the underworld permanently because she’d eaten six pomegranate seeds (which are hexagonal) that Hades had given her, at which Demeter (goddess of agriculture) stopped crops growing and humanity (Zeus’ pets) faced starvation, so Zeus’ compromise was that Persephone had to annually spend spend six months with her mother but the remaining six months back in the Underworld.

The six theme is marked....it has something to do with Guardians!
This story also mention her eating four seeds and therefore spending four months in the underworld. This was probably to correspond better with the length of the Greek winter.

Six is still the reoccurring number. Even the Floral formula has 3+3 twice.

Just don't grab anything if you find Raxxla, and go down the portal. Not even fuel scooping.
