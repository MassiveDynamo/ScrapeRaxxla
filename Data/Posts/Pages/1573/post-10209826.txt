By any way commanders...lemme just drop that: its mentioned only elite pilots will / can find Raxxla. Does it mean, you have to reach elite in any discipline to have a chance of finding Raxxla??
Where is your ED-specific source for this? I'm interested.

Personally I believe (and have stated it before in this thread) that you need all the Elite ranks; without any proof, of course. To me it 'makes sense', given how 'hard' it is (for example) to get a G5 suit or to get a ship that's behind an Imperial or Federation rank. Can't imaging any Tom, or Harry coming across Elite. Well, so far nobody has. YMMV, of course!

I'd be interested to know how many here have (is it 5?) all the Elites who are searching for Raxxla.

Good luck with your search, CMDR!
