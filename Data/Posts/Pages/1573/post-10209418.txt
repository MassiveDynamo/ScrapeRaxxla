Four weeks since I last flew, chest still tight but getting better. Finally off the cough medicine!

But I found a brilliant scifi book to read...Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir who wrote The Martian. I’m a third of the way through & heartily recommend it!


Mmm, just realised he also wrote “Artemis”....is he an ED player??
Must put that one on my “to get” list!
I'll be honest Andy Weir is one of the authors that I believe contributed to the 419 historical novels (Secrets of Simulating Backgrounds) referenced by Transport Lakon Baker Gamma Sierra Heavy. Also, if you haven't played Deliver Us the Moon and Deliver Us Mars the timelines suspiciously line up to the Elite Universe. Helium-3 is a real thing. It also fits nicely with those who founded Sirius Corporation dealing with Hydrogen, Hydrogen isotopes, or products from Hydrogen's fusion and/or fission. Project Outward and the fight over saving Earth or letting it decay is also very interesting.
