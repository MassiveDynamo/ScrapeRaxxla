This may actually be promising. There is a passenger missions out of Robigo to "Sol's true north star" as in definitely not Polaris (rep-locked and hard to trigger). Wonder where this will lead?
Well its going to be a couple of weeks as im currently on my way to Colonia, but once im back in the bubble i will take some time at Robigo and see if i can get the mission.
Im triple elite and spent that much time running missions from there the bar tender knows my tipple, so rep isn't an issue.
