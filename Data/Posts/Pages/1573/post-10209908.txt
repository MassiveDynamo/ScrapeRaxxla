Silly hypothesis coming up!

I've been re-reading the abduction of Persephone myth. I think the story is interesting because Persephone has a system, a planet and a station in ED. In addition there are several uses of the name Cora. I've used this version: https://www.greekmyths-greekmythology.com/myth-of-hades-and-persephone/
The second version, that includes Demeter (no fun without her). the story is simple:

Demeter and Persephone descends to earth.
Demeter has some agri. business, Persphone plays with friends (Nerids and Naiads).
Hades likes her, asks Zeus for help and they get Gaia to plant a yellow Narcissus flower (daffodil): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissus_(plant)
Persephone likes the flower, picks it and gets sucked down to the underworld in the hole left by the stem of the flower.
The Nerid Cyan tries to help P., but turns into a river.
Demeter comes back and is not happy. She turns the other Naiads and Nerids into Sirens.
After a while Demeter bumps into Hecate. Hecate is a clever girl. She tells Demeter to check with Helios (the Sun), because he can see everything.
Helios tells what happened. Demeter confronts Hades (her brother). He agrees to let Persephone go back to Demeter.
Unfortunately Persephone ate some pomegranate seeds before she left the underworld. She therefor has to go back down, every winter (6 or 4 months each year).

We have all read this story. Nothing new here. What I started to wonder about was the flower. It acts as a plug to the portal of the underworld.
The Narcissus has an interesting Floral diagram:


And an interesting Floral formula:
Floral formula
Br ✶ ☿ P3+3+Corona A3+3 G(3)
Bracteate, Actinomorphic, Bisexual
Perianth: 6 tepals in 2 ls of 3
Stamens: 2 ls of 3
Ovary: Superior – 3 fused carpels
Notis the Mercury symbol.

Here comes the silly hypothesis:

Raxxla is controlled by a sinister cabal. They are not the wicked men that Rafe Zetter tells about. They are wicked women. They all carry flower names and control important positions. Examples are:

Florence Lavigny, mother of the Emperor.
Jasmina Halsey, ex president of the Fedreration and the mysterious only survivor of the Starship One accident: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmine
Azalea Halsey, Jasminas sister: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azalea
Felicia Winters, shadow president and ex president of the Federation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felicia_amelloides
