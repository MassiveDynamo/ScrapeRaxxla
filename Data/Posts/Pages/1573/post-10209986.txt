Silly hypothesis coming up!

I've been re-reading the abduction of Persephone myth. I think the story is interesting because Persephone has a system, a planet and a station in ED. In addition there are several uses of the name Cora. I've used this version: https://www.greekmyths-greekmythology.com/myth-of-hades-and-persephone/
The second version, that includes Demeter (no fun without her). the story is simple:

Demeter and Persephone descends to earth.
Demeter has some agri. business, Persphone plays with friends (Nerids and Naiads).

We have all read this story. Nothing new here. What I started to wonder about was the flower. It acts as a plug to the portal of the underworld.
The Narcissus has an interesting Floral diagram:


And an interesting Floral formula:




Notis the Mercury symbol.

Here comes the silly hypothesis:

Raxxla is controlled by a sinister cabal. They are not the wicked men that Rafe Zetter tells about. They are wicked women. They all carry flower names and control important positions. Examples are:

I like silly theories. I have one about dinosaurs....
Oops, might have borrowed that from someone...
I’ll (silly) walk away....


You forgot to mention that Persephone couldn’t leave the underworld permanently because she’d eaten six pomegranate seeds (which are hexagonal) that Hades had given her, at which Demeter (goddess of agriculture) stopped crops growing and humanity (Zeus’ pets) faced starvation, so Zeus’ compromise was that Persephone had to annually spend spend six months with her mother but the remaining six months back in the Underworld.

The six theme is marked....it has something to do with Guardians!
