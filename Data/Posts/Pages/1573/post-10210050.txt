This story also mention her eating four seeds and therefore spending four months in the underworld. This was probably to correspond better with the length of the Greek winter.

Six is still the reoccurring number. Even the Floral formula has 3+3 twice.

Just don't grab anything if you find Raxxla, and go down the portal. Not even fuel scooping.
What, not even those free Lavian brandy samples???
