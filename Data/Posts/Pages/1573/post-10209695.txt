My take: exploration is required to see the galaxy for what it is. Combat is for survival but this could come through other avenues. You can follow orders, but if you cannot think about what you see bad things happen. ELITE is more here about having sufficiently advanced skills to handle whatever you face. Another big part of this is mentioned in the Invitation:

All you need to know is that my organisation has a very specific remit: to seek out those who have the potential to become real movers and shakers, those precious few with the talent to mould and shape the galaxy around them, to create change on a grand scale.

We find them, and then we test them. Consider this your test.

Take the ship. Take the money. No strings, no hidden clauses.

Do with them what you will. Blaze your own trail.

Impress me, perhaps youâ€™ll learn more.
