I wouldn't say maxed out just Elite (Elite I, etc). A very large portion of early CMDR learning is progressively taking increasingly dangerous jobs. Skills pay the bills. That said, the story started in a system noted for propaganda so learning to see through things is just as important. Also, see my posting that quotes the Invitation.
Thx for the hint, yeah. Im tripple Elite, rest is close...thinking 'bout starting prestige...but not sure it would be worth it. mb i'll just give it a try, but need to level fast i guess to reach elite again and getting "tested" one day...even thinking of gettin close to a region of the respective system Raxxla is located...hunt's still not over I see
