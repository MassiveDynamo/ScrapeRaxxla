Regards Achenar > Polaris negative.

If looking at Yggdrasil in game using our traditional galactic north/south alignment, the trunk is no where near this alignment.
This may actually be promising. There is a passenger missions out of Robigo to "Sol's true north star" as in definitely not Polaris (rep-locked and hard to trigger). Wonder where this will lead?
