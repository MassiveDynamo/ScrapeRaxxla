…. Just like thargoid and guardian devices needing three inputs….. you probably need to be elite in three professions. I suspect it doesnt matter which three, but who knows.
There was only combat at the beginning. Everything other than Combat was added in Elite Dangerous. Yes, you could do the others but they were essentially "side-quests" for personal gratification previously. Also, a reminder on what was inherently linked to that combat rank - how your CMDR conducted themselves. There was a "right" and "wrong" way to achieve ELITE.



From the Wikipedia entry for Fortuna:
Fortuna's identity as personification of chance events was closely tied to virtus (strength of character). Public officials who lacked virtues invited ill-fortune on themselves and Rome: Sallust uses the infamous Catiline as illustration – "Truly, when in the place of work, idleness, in place of the spirit of measure and equity, caprice and pride invade, fortune is changed just as with morality".
