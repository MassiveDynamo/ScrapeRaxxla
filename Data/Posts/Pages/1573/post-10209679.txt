By any way commanders...lemme just drop that: its mentioned only elite pilots will / can find Raxxla. Does it mean, you have to reach elite in any discipline to have a chance of finding Raxxla??
TDW novella makes it pretty damned obvious it is combat or nothing (or at least Elite in one of the others but able to handle anything).

Rafe Zetter leaned forward so that his grizzled features seemed almost able to kiss the younger man. ‘He was a combateer, Alex. One of the best. No way should he have died like he did…’

‘My father was a trader, not a combateer,’ Alex said, startled and disturbed by what Rafe was implying.

‘Guess again, sonny.’

‘But it sickened him to fire shots in anger.’

‘Maybe,’ Rafe said drily. ‘But it didn’t stop him. How else do you think he made it as a trader all those years? Dammit, Alex, even if your cargo is sour-cream and pickles there’s someone’s going to try and take it from you. Your father was a combateer of the highest calibre.’

Alex swallowed heavily, staring at the quizzical features of old Rafe Zetter. ‘The highest calibre?’

Rafe nodded. ‘That’s right, Alex,’ he said softly. ‘You can be deadly, you can be dangerous, and you can end up as pet food in orbit around a dog’s ass-of-a-world like Isveve. But if you’re Elite, and you die, then there’s a reason for your death…’

I believe the general implication is that getting ELITE in any of them, out of necessity, endows many CMDRs with hard-learned skills of survival in even the challenging of circumstances. Finding Raxxla appears to be a very dangerous profession.
