THx, 4 reply.
Yeah, I did read this, but wondered whether at least one of the "core" ranks must be maxed out. Looks like, the rest must reach a certain level as well...
I wouldn't say maxed out just Elite (Elite I, etc). A very large portion of early CMDR learning is progressively taking increasingly dangerous jobs. Skills pay the bills. That said, the story started in a system noted for propaganda so learning to see through things is just as important. Also, see my posting that quotes the Invitation.
