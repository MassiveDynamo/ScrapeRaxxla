Four weeks since I last flew, chest still tight but getting better. Finally off the cough medicine!

But I found a brilliant scifi book to read...Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir who wrote The Martian. I’m a third of the way through & heartily recommend it!


Mmm, just realised he also wrote “Artemis”....is he an ED player??
Must put that one on my “to get” list!
