The more i think about it- the more i believe u need to be triple elite. I suspect you will also need to be at the right place and time and might even need some extra trinkets or something…. But three fates

…. Just like thargoid and guardian devices needing three inputs….. you probably need to be elite in three professions. I suspect it doesnt matter which three, but who knows.

The symbolism is tied to the central axis myth… I suspect the myth is not just common among human societies - but its in thargoid and guardian memory as well.
