Also, what's the logic behind the assertion that only the Mayflower could have been capable of the speeds discussed? Is there anything to suggest that drive tech on subsequent Generation Ships regressed?
Thetis and all other subsequent generation ships have had their velocity calculated by Independent Raxxla Hunters and Canonn Science (or at least folks from their discord) and all calculated speeds are between 20-23% lightspeed. All the others got about 1/3 of maximum speed capable of Mayflower 97 launched in 2097.
