You don't understand how Bussard Ramjets would have theoretically worked - year over year acceleration of 0.6 LY/year continuously. Meaning within 2 years it is going at very close to lightspeed. Braking would be a nightmare. But, hey, it is fictional. This wasn't written by physicists.
Is there a source for the 0.6c per year figure? The FFE journal gives 0.6c as the Mayflower's speed, not its acceleration.

But regardless, here's some more issues with the idea it must have been the Mayflower:
If the logic is only the Mayflower could have made the journey, then we can discount that immediately because it was a fleet that arrived at Achenar, not just a single ship.

If it was the Mayflower, then how come where the Mayflower went after Tau Ceti isn't known? Presumably everyone who stopped at Achenar would have known fine well that they were on the Mayflower, so why would it be concealed from history?
Also, what's the logic behind the assertion that only the Mayflower could have been capable of the speeds discussed? Is there anything to suggest that drive tech on subsequent Generation Ships regressed?
