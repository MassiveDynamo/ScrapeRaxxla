Why would the Achenar colonisation fleet lack access to hyperspace?
No, commercial ships had it until 2800s per the GalNet "Galactic News: Hyperspace". Military and likely very rich corporations had access to hyperspace but not laypersons.

Continuing our popular series on significant episodes from human history, noted historian Sima Kalhana discusses the development of the hyperdrive.

"Hyperspace technology originated in the early 22nd Century, but it wasn't until the 2800s that consumer ships began to take advantage of it."
