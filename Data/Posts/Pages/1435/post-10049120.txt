Mayflower 97 is the only ship that could have made the journey especially given the Bussard Ramjet design and acceleration of 60% of lightspeed in the necessary time frame.
The Mayflower 97 couldn't have made the journey, which in the context is the key point.

If we take 60%c as the max speed of the mayflower than for Sol -> Tau Ceti -> Achenar, with instantaneous acceleration and deceleration, and no pause at Tau Ceti, the Mayflower would have needed to set off in 2012.
