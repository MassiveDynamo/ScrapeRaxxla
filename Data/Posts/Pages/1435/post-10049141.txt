The Mayflower 97 couldn't have made the journey, which in the context is the key point.

If we take 60%c as the max speed of the mayflower than for Sol -> Tau Ceti -> Achenar, with instantaneous acceleration and deceleration, and no pause at Tau Ceti, the Mayflower would have needed to set off in 2012.
You don't understand how Bussard Ramjets would have theoretically worked - year over year acceleration of 0.6 LY/year continuously. Meaning within 2 years it is going at very close to lightspeed. Braking would be a nightmare. But, hey, it is fictional. This wasn't written by physicists.
