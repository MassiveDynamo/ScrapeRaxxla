TDW --> TDW "dark" station --> Raxxla...?

Whilst I've always harboured thought they are the link and would be cool to find the station anyway... Have I missed something? There's no confirmation in lore they found Raxxla (ED lore not FFE, etc!).

Isn't the current lore they found Soontil but never found Raxxla?
Yes, but Soontill 1 where the "Secret Base" beacon is utterly unlandable. That planet is fatal to all forms of life. Nevermind, that Thargoids can only tolerate cold temperatures (Soontill was supposed to contain tons of Thargoid loot).

Secret Base beacon:

System: Soontill
Distance to Sol: 280.69 ly
Distance to Arrival: 18 ls
Situated: Orbital
Body: Soontill 1


Group: Beacon
Beacon Type: Tourist Beacon
Tourist Spot: 0508


This is rumoured to be the site of the CIEP base. Some stories claim a combined Human-Thargoid project took place here.

The planet in question:
Atmospheric pressure sufficient to crush anything and hotter than most stars. But, by all means that contains Thargoid loot. Don't even get me started on the Technetium in that system that is only naturally forged in asymptotic giant branch stars (stars liked by Guardians).

From "..And Here the Wheel":


Why Garry's Reclamations is important (as in Robert Garry):


Proof of Technetium presence:
