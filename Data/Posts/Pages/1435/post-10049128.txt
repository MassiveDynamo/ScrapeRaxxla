Though, even without the technical details, Achenar is settled before the Raxxla rumors exist
We don't know this. The date in the Codex is just the earliest known written reference to Raxxla. However, the codex also makes clear that the rumour is established by that point. We don't know how long it's been established for, and it could well predate the arrival of Duval's fleet in Achenar.
