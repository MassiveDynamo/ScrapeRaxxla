My personal take on what specifically is obscured would indicate something specifically linked to Hyperspace is what is trying to be hidden. Think about it, when your Fleet Carrier jumps it uploads the navigation data for some reason. I think Faraway may have been part of Talmor Lens network and is still in use by humans. Also, something majorly miniaturized our jump technology. Sidewinders and shuttles could not originally fit jump drives. I believe you the Hauler is the modern variant of the Worm Landing Craft from from the first game. Additionally, when escorting larger ships the Sidewinder used the Hyperspace rift of the larger ship to follow it similar to how we hyperspace wake scan then follow ships. This is covered in-game on the screen you purchase ships on the Sidewinder specifically.

Frameshift Drive may be a take on the literary technique called a Frame story which had its' origins in ancient Egypt.
