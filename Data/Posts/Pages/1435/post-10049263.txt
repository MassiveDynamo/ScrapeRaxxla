TDW --> TDW "dark" station --> Raxxla...?

Whilst I've always harboured thought they are the link and would be cool to find the station anyway... Have I missed something? There's no confirmation in lore they found Raxxla (ED lore not FFE, etc!).

Isn't the current lore they found Soontil but never found Raxxla?
Well, come to that thereâ€™s no confirmation that TDW actually exist! And the lore about them finding Soontil but not Raxxla comes from a book, external to the game and therefore not necessarily canon.
