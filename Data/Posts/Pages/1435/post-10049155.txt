Sadly, if you go by the hard science route the Bussard Ramjet was later determined to be needing a positively monstrous magnetic field to work. Just let's run with it since those papers came out after the lore for that was written. Besides, don't know how else we explain Achenar being colonized. This is fictional after all.
What's the issue with FTL travel being used by Duval's colonisation fleet? Generations ships being used for mass transit doesn't preclude a group with sufficient resources and determination attempting to make a colonisation effort via FTL.
