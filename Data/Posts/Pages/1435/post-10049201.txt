No, commercial ships had it until 2800s per the GalNet "Galactic News: Hyperspace". Military and likely very rich corporations had access to hyperspace but not laypersons.
Someone capable of organising and funding an interstellar colonisation fleet to go to what at the time was a hugely distant system is not a layperson.
