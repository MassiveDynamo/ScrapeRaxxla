Do you actually want me to bury you in references citing mid-23rd century colonization of Achenar, Mudlarks, and all kinds of things like the Federal response to Mudlark extinction that could not have happened otherwise? Yes, first written account - that much we agree on. However, all cited events happen BEFORE 2296 so it still needs to be considered. If Soontill is impossible, TDW found Raxxla (or really has a problem with lying unnecessarily).

Soontill was to prevent most people from looking but was an obvious cover-up if you so much as look at the details. This is why Elvira Martuuk had you fetch Soontill Relics so it would force you to think. We know who The Dark Wheel is and we interact with them. They are us.

Who do you think invited you and gave you your ship and perpetual insurance? Who runs the Federation, Empire, and Alliance? Who issued the invitation (aka permit) to their base memorializing their leader (Peter Jameson) when you become Elite? The same leader we sent off with fanfare to Colonia ushered by The Hands of the Architects (Peter's Wreck is in Facece)? The Dark Wheel did all that. The Club and The Dark Wheel are the same damned thing.

The point I was making was simply that we don't know that the Raxxla rumour originated after the colonisation of Achenar.
