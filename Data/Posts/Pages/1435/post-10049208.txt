we don't know that the Raxxla rumour originated after the colonisation of Achenar.
I mean it could be Sol, but that system has been checked pretty damn thoroughly. I mean it is possible something seemed miniscule and was dismissed but I have my doubts. The more problematic part is which parts of history in Elite Dangerous are misrepresented. We have the hyperdrive technology came from Thargoids (which I have yet to see much that actually backs that assertion), we have the origins of the Coriolis buried, we have connections to Sol buried, and even if the series was indeed a series, there is also the Soontill debacle.
