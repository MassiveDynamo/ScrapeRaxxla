Oh, I’m convinced its location will be glaringly obvious, once (i.e. if) we find it!
And I think it will be close to the centre of the bubble.
Michael Brookes did say it has to be “ a little bit obvious so people know what they are doing”, we just haven’t been looking at it in the right way, yet. But then, if it was easy the Quest wouldn’t be any fun!

I have a few more ideas I want to check out, but home improvement season has started....
What if we have all ready found it? We just don't know yet, because we haven't been able to activate the portal.

If we compare what Rafe Zetter says about Raxxla in the Dark Wheel, it matches rader well with the Guardian ruins.

Rafe describes Raxxla:
1. 'Raxxla's no alien, Alex. It's a ghost world. A planet. A legend…'
2. on Raxxla there's an alien construct that's a gateway to other Universes, and all that's in those Universes in the way of bounty, and treasures, and aliens, and life…
3. there are people on Raxxla already. This is only a guess, mind you, but from what happened to Jason I'd say it was close to being right. We've long suspected that a corps of Elites lives there, and are exploiting the gateway. They're powerful, twisted men. Powerful enough to hire an assassin to kill the threat to their dominance.'

1. Guardian planets are definitely ghosts words. No one is alive, but the ruins lives on and are still active.
2. Guardian ruins are portals to the guardian network. It's not unlikely that Guardian AI (constructs) lives in the network as sentient virtual beings in a full virtual universe.
3. In Premonition it was revealed that the existens of Guardian ruins were leaked by the Club. The Club are powerfull and twisted. They also seem to have advanced technological knowledge, they can leak when needed.

So? Do we have the door, but haven't figured out the key or is Raxxla the part we are still missing?
