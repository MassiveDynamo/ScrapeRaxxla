By the way, also an interesting point. when creating the 1984 elite, the guys used a unique function and algorithm using assembler to generate the names of the planets, assign attributes and save computer memory of those years, which actually created galaxies for the 1984 elite with unique names and attributes, which were deliberately reduced to 8 galaxies, but theoretically much more could be generated there .Now, if we have math geniuses, using this math, at what point can we have the planet Raxxla at some stage of generation? maybe this will shed some light on this mystery ... at least we will know that this is a planet
