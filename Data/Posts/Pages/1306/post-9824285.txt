Whilst Ghroth sings his song.

But seriously, HPL references haven’t reared their heads much in ED. If MB did write/was integral to implementing Raxxla it’s pretty likely he would include some direct/ indirect reference to HPL, and to some extent I feel they have, especially regarding the narrative.

The Pleiades featured heavily in HPL works, so does Delphi, so I imagine that might be relevant.

I’m unsure, as I’m no HPL fan.
