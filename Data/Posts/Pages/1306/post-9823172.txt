Would answer “place that is not a place”, but “door that is also the key”?
Get keys from Guardian beacons...anybody tried using them in the ruins other than to get Guardian blueprints?

However MB said Raxxla is a definite place, and IMHO I don't think a Guardian virtual network fits that.

However my hypothesis that it is one of the Guardian ark ships mentioned in Ram Tah’s translation would. Why would FD mention them if they’re not part of the storyline? Moreover Ive been pondering the translation of Shinrarta Dezhra (“In life she saw hope”) and it would make sense if one of those ark ships came to Sol or SD and the “she” was a Guardian, and she founded the PF to get humanity combat fit for the Thargoid struggle.

So I still think Raxxla is in/near Sol or SD, and we just haven’t found the gateway to it. And I still can’t get that Blue Danube tribute to 2001 Space Odyssey (an odyssey is “a journey” that anyone might make!) and that 2001SO interstellar gateway was found near Jupiter, and the ED “Mars Relic” was (according to Allen Stroud’s thesis) originally supposed to have been returned by a probe from orbit around Europa.....
