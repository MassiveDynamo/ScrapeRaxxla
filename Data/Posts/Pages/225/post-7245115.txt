I rescue my message from Reddit with my theory about the location of Raxxla:

......

I have the theory that Raxxla is placed near the Formidine Rift. The ship that was exploring that place that was found some years ago would be investigating something related to it. Bovomit area is forbidden, and it's placed in that direction.

Another interesting point is that Sirius Corp started colonizing a line of systems in that direction, but abandoned that work (Sothis and Ceos).
It's being said for long that Thargoids were coming, and my theory is that Sirius started building a "road" to evacuate humanity towards Raxxla. Humanity is in severe risk of being wiped out, like happened with the Guardians.
And what would Raxxla be? A Portal to another galaxy built by Guardians to escape from Thargoids. It makes sense, because... it would be a new game ($$$ and €€€) with lots of regions to explore and colonize. Also keep in mind that the original Elite had access to 8 different galaxies.
......

The problem is that we may not able to find Raxxla yet, as it would be hidden in the Bovomit sector.

I've had this theory for years, and there's nothing yet that contradicts it.
Except the Guardians weren’t wiped out by the Thargoids, and if the info from the Guardian obelisks is to believed, they were never really in danger of being wiped out by the Thargoids.
