So since the CODEX update of RAXXLA and the "with eyes to see", within the passsage stating that it could be related to Sir P.S.: His Astrophel and Stella, seems like a possible clue to me, writings can be found here:

Sir P.S.: His Astrophel and Stella

written on many pages is 14457 19 22 and in the corner of the third page (with lib stamp) is 39 -167 44

Searched the galaxy map 3D array (coords system) and found nothing of interest really @ 14457 19 22 neither @ 39 -167 44

Also wikipedia (eww) Astrophel_and_Stella, verse nine:

Queen Vertues court, some call Stellas face,
Prepar'd by Natures chiefest furniture,
Hath his front built of Alabaster pure;
Gold is the covering of that stately place
The doore by which sometimes comes forth her Grace,
Red Porphir is, which locke of pearl makes sure:

Search red in galaxyy may and found RED RECTANGLE permit locked system 1.4k ly's away from bubble.

Drunk so just giving basic info at the moment but there is a thread of logic to the process I went through to reach these conclusions.

However, short of writing a program to manipulate the letters contained with the book, removing all the letters apart from I's and C's or a connection between I2C .. umm

oh and there is also this book from 14457 19 22 that is the new and full moons 1001 B.C. to A.D. 1651:
