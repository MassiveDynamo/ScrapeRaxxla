Mmm
All afternoon to set up my keybinds for 3.3 (I changed back to my hotas from dual stick and totally revamped the button usage), then 2 hours to fss scan one system (admitedly it did have 73 bodies, but it was a dreadfuly slow process!).

This is going to cut down my questing speed dramatically! It will take ten times as long to disprove my latest hypotheses!
