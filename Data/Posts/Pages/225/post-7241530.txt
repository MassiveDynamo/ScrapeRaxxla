From the Codex entry on Raxxla. "To the whisperer in witch-space the siren of the deepest void"

Didn't Dynasty report hearing whispers in witch-space? They also referred to them as songs of sirens.

Add this to 'the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies' being Cassiopia (How did people find this?), you end up back out into the Elysian Shore and the FRift. Lovely, we're back here again.

Obfuscated IN the outer rim, not BY the outer rim. So I'd say Dynasty passed right by Raxxla. So we're looking at the outer span of the Elysian Shores.

To narrow it down a bit, we'd need to know where Dynasty started hearing 'whispers'.

They did. Jacques did to.
