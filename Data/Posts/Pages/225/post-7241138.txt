Think I said I was too fed up to ask again, but Dom was on the livestream (he who knows exactly why the missions got lost) so I took the opportunity to ask him in the livestream "q: Dom are the founder missions gone for good after not migrating to 2.x mission system?"

Dom: "Don't have any comment on that, but we are aware of that, but yeah nothing to announce."
Ed (distracted): "mmm. Great"
Dom: "But erm yeah it does come up occasionally. we hear you."
Ed: Echo's "we hear you".


So looks like the original Founder missions are definitely gone and don't hold your breath for them returning.
