Been thinking ... it could be quite possible that the Guardian Ruins are somehow linked to Raxxla. Rafe Zetter did say that, on Raxxla, there is "an alien construct that's a gateway to other Universes".

So far we know of only two confirmed Alien races that have to potential technological advancement to create something on the level of Raxxla: The Thargoids or The Guardians. Perhaps the reason we can't find any living Guardians is because they used Raxxla to escape this particular Universe?

Chalk this up to just another one of my random musings. If Raxxla is connected to the Guardians then it is just a matter of time before someone pursuing that particular mystery stumbles upon it. Me? I'm going to proceed forward as though the Guardians and Raxxla are two separate things.

Good theory! We need as many ideas as possible with this mystery
