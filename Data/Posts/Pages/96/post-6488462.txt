Which makes nebulae be so interesting ....

Yes. Nebulae would be visible from multiple angles as long as they aren't obscured by other nebulae or dark regions of space. That is what made Cassiopeia A such an interesting prospect. As a radio source Cas A is one of the strongest sources in the galaxy. You would expect, that if faster-than-light travel exists in the real universe some place like Cas A would become a natural "magnet" that alien species could travel to and meet up with each other. At least that was part of the reason for our expedition (has it really been over a year?). Sadly there is no Cas A in-game but one wonders what other interstellar landmarks exist that would have drawn multiple species out to investigate? Apparently the Pleiades is one ...
