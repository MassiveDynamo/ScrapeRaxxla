Any theory is as good as any other, because it's not RL and everything in the game comes out of the FDevs mind and will (which has proved many times to be inconsistent).
The thing is ... Since MB and DW are out of the party, is there someone among the FDevs interested (and knowing the lore background) in continuing the Raxxla Quest at this moment ?
I doubt it.
