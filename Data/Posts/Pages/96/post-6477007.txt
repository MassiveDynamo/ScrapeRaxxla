I left the bubble soon as all these new things started happening. Thargoids, Guardians.. It's not that I wasn't interested, it was all just bit too much. Didn't even visit engineers before leaving. I like simple things, like shooting spaceships in a Gunship, or searching for truth in some nebulae Randomius knows where, but collecting data packages from obelisks, again? The horror. Where's the tinfoil in that.

Quite. The Guardians' puzzle can be cracked in a day. The Formidine Rift took, what? Nearly two years? Even then Drew had to spoon feed us the answers. Raxxla? We may be no closer now then we were when the game went live. It is my sincere hope that, if we find it, we find it through perseverance and hard work. I'll be extremely disappointed if they decide to spoon feed us some easy clues to hurry us along. I'd rather search for fifteen years, find nothing and watch them decomm the game servers first.

Hmm... There’s a bit of a general misconception that the obelisks (and now the new puzzle) is the be all and end all of the Guardians stuff. That’s not the case though. The Obelisk stuff is just effectively the easy part of the stuff at the Guardian ruins. And the new puzzle is the very easy part. Comparatively. There’s various other things that have been there since 2.2 which remain more or less completely unsolved.

So without going in to depth of those, for the more tinfoilly side of things, there’s the points in my reply to HZ above, i.e, just how long have some bits of humanity had access to Guardian space, who are they and what have they done with that knowledge? Also, there’s the possibility of connections to what Halsey and Jacques encountered.
