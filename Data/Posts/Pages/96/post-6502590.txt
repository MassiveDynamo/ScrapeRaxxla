I dont think the energy our SRV guns use is special,Ram Tah said that kinetic energy would be the best type to activate the pylons and we have been using kinetic weapons a long time.

The guardians did too,they used magnetic catapults to launch their ships,rail gun type weapons that launch a slug etc

So could probably rule that out. But yeah it is a bit suspicious how he managed the rest in such a short timeframe.
