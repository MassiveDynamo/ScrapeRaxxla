I'd say the centre of the galaxy is rather boring to a space developed civilization, as there's intelligent life to find out there etc and of course archaeology.

Of course it's boring, you don't fly to visit airports but it's the one thing every galaxy has and like an airport there should be a tourist bureau there because provincialism is the one universal "see our greatness". If you think checking a paltry 400,000,000 stars is tough there's a few orders of magnitude more galaxies than stars in this quaint place. Not to mention the incomparable numerical terror the multi-verse guys face, there's numbers to scare gods.
