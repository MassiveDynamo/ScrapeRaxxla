That is actually a very interesting theory, sadly I am unable to recognize constellations... But I will try to identify some of them if I reach my destination soon.

The problem is that constellations seen from Earth are based on a star's apparent brightness and not in the star's proximity to other stars in the constellation. Trying to view a constellation from any other position in the galaxy would result in some of the constellation's stars shifting out of the constellation while stars from other constellations move into view.

Bottom line: Constellations are only relevant to their apparent position when viewed from Sol. Once you change the point of reference as an observer they lose meaning.
