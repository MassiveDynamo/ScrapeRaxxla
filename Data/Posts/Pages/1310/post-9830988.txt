I did hypothesise a while ago that the toast gave instructions to go from Sol (the Jewel, according to Galnet, and Mother Gaia was the mother of Uranus the Sky (hence mother of galaxies)) to Sirius/Lucifer (Whisperer in witchspace (FSD expertise), also the siren of the void in Paradise Lost (MB’s favourite book IIRC)). Sirius B is a White Dwarf which gives a boosted jump. I tried it and nothing out of the ordinary happened. Seem to remember I also approached it at right angles to the beams so I could get close and drop out of SC, but also found nothing, Sirius might also be the Jewel, since it’s the brightest star in the Northern Hemisphere (think Alpha Cent is brightest in Southern ). Also wondered if the boosted jump led to a system containing Raxxla, but didn't see anything interesting.
