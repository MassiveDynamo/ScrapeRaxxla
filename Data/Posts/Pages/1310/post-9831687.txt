what reason would they have for that, though?
It’s an unknown.

But there is a link on the first page of this thread concerning it. There was a missions update around that time. That could have caused some technical issue, although I presume it was bugged from the outset, as many Cmdrs who undertook the missions fed back data to these forums, and none of them seem to correlate or resolve into anything.

Add on top of that a major overhaul of lore circa 2016/2017 around the same time, one can only guess. But one hypothesis is it was bugged, likely it was some narrative story which couldn’t be fixed so FD binned it. If true that would explain the Codexes obscurity and befuddling counterintuitive nonsense, in my humble tin-foolery, I presume the codex is a ‘clean slate’ re-write / get out clause, and from its inception, Raxxla was either fixed, or put back in albeit somehow differently, but truth is no one really knows.

It is a important however as it throws shade at all information about Raxxla prior to that date, because FD confirmed they removed them, and in doing so potentially changed something, so all previous information about Raxxla could have become obsolete as well.

However one must also take some comfort from the fact that FD never confirmed this until only recently, and only under direct scrutiny/cross examination; so if they were not wanting to admit it then one could assume that all previous lore regards Raxxla is still valid, as they kept quiet about it?

One could take comfort from that?
