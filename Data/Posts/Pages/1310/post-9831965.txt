I've always wondered what they scan you for.... Guardian stuff? or looking for something?

I know people have dumped Thargoid and Guardian stuff for them....

Anyone tried SAP8 and Trinkets of fortune?
I don't think there are anything that hasn't been dropped for Thargoids. SAP8s and Trinkets does not provoke any reaction, as far as i remember.

Thargoids are interested in three things.

Guardian stuff will make them hostile and they destroy them when dropped.
Thargoid stuff (including meta alloys) makes them hostile and they scoop them when dropped.
People of all kind, like slaves, prisoners, escape pods and even master chefs will keep them neutral on scan. On drop they are scooped immediately.


Thargoids hate all guardian tech, considers all thargoid objects stolen and they collect humans in large numbers.
