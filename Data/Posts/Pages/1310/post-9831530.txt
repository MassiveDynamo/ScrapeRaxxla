I can’t presently locate the original source, nor the actual discussion word-for-word, but I certainly recall it occurring… is that at some earlier point some Cmdrs told FD they were off on an exploration trip to find Raxxla; FD response was something along the lines of ‘better choose your ship wisely’ or something or other…ring any bells?
I remember this or something very similar, it was also around when we handt got as many as we have now, mostly just the cross over FF ships (minus belugas, kraits, Alliance etc) Id imagine Cobra, asp anaconda etc
