Yep, and all those darn explorers went off gallivanting around the Galaxy getting permits and finding stuff before they were supposed to, rather than sedately doing missions along the narrative path as they were supposed to. Blame the explorers of course, and not the designers who didn't seem to have a clue how MMORPGs work or how to make them fun, and tried to bodge single-player missions, endless grind, and other "features" like Powerplay and the arcade game thing into one. Problem since day zero has been Elite Dangerous' split personality between single-player and multiplayer, and attempts to do both that led to compromises and poor design all over the place.
