Maybe it was an illusion to using the basic jump range of a starting ship to get to an engineer to start the journey. sirius is one of the first engineers. Is it in range of a boosted basic jump range for the mentioned ship type?
Sirius is 8.59 ly from Sol. Default jump range of a Sidey is 7.25ly, but dont know offhand if that’s with an A rated fsd. So it’s a feasible hypothesis, though I don’t find it convincing.
