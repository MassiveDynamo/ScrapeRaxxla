Over thought a portion of this for far too long, the toast isn't a map or some other riddle. It is simply a tribute to the wondrous astronomical tool of legendary explorers and treasure seekers, a boosted jump. White dwarf being the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies. These are extremely hot, believed to have enormous diamond-like centers and given enough mass siphoned from a binary companion will explode in a supernova producing a black hole. The second body being a neutron star, faint almost whisper sounds can be heard using FSS and can serve as a lure to travelers to make jumps to systems they cannot return from, thus a siren.

This neither proves or disproves Raxxla, but rather change the focus of inquiry.

My hypothesis is that Raxxla is either a construct or natural phenomenon that would also result in a boosted jump, perhaps without limit. The failure to return and not knowing their fate would be the parent's grief, the lovers woe yet our vagabond hearts press us onward.

edit: This also reminds me of a Braden comment during the debate on the white dwarf/neutron jump distance multiplier. IIRC he was disappointed on the results of the community poll results (he was in favor if much lower multiplier). <tinfol> Perhaps he didn't want to diminish Raxxla's significance. </tinfoil>

It's as good a thought as all the others... Good luck!


"the jump range increase is considerable: +50% for white dwarfs and +300% for neutron stars" not enough in my opinion
