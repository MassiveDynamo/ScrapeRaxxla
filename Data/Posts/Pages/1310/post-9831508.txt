I can’t presently locate the original source, nor the actual discussion word-for-word, but I certainly recall it occurring… is that at some earlier point some Cmdrs told FD they were off on an exploration trip to find Raxxla; FD response was something along the lines of ‘better choose your ship wisely’ or something or other…ring any bells?
