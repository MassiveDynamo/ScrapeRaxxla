True but a little bit obvious could well be an historical clue. Personally I suspect Brookes was just alluding to the removed missions. They were pretty obvious… a place that is not a place… those were in my opinion the ‘original’ path, but it got canned. I honestly believe the Codex is a redux map of that old storyline and does point the way, but that reference; it’s old and can’t be trusted anymore I think.

So nope I don’t believe it’s obvious anymore. It may have been.
