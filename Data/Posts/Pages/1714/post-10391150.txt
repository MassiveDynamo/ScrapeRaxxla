I think this Drabble, written by Michael Brookes about his book "The Space Inbetween" might have been (a version of) the plot for Raxxla:

Imagine that Hyperspace is "a maze of nothingness". The creatures visible in Witch Space and the Landscape Signal show "their impossible forms".

"No faith alone can unlock their prison, but science has the key." - like, Hyperdrives, for example? What if the Sirens (Raxxlan aliens) are trying to attract someone with a Hyperdrive to the Rift?

I assume the full Siren Song (Landscape Signal) image, when revealed, will tell the full story...
This sparked a memory of an earlier discussion about Labyrinth. MB's concept of this "horror imprisoned inside a maze of nothingness... a complex space between containing their impossible forms" is very evocative of the various ancient conflicts we know of in the lore (Guardian-Thargoid, Guardian-Construct). So too does Milton refer to the symbolism of a maze in Book 9 of Paradise Lost.

The Raxxla logo could thus be a symbolic abstraction representing the labyrinth / prison containing whatever Raxxla is. So then our mission may be to navigate the various layers comprising tests of skill and courage to reach the central goal. Perhaps the Labyrinth system is a starting point for this journey.

I wonder then if this also ties to the Princess allegory, where a character like Julia might be imprisoned within, or where we might find an NPC character that could 'guide' us through their routine path.
