8th moon of a gas giant....
Technically a star is a gas giant and it's moons are planets.

On a side note travelling to hd 21811 i found a string of systems withen 500ly that had been honked but not scanned, one even has an earth like.

Once I get back I'll drop the pics of my discoveries - 2x systems have binary planets that the distance between them is smaller then their diameter.
