This life's dim windows of the soul
Distorts the heavens from pole to pole
And leads you to believe a lie
When you see with, not through, the eye.

The Everlasting Gospel (1818) (d) l. 99


I give you the end of a golden string;
Only wind it into a ball:
It will lead you in at Heaven's gate,
Built in Jerusalem's wall.

Jerusalem (1815) ‘To the Christians’ (plate 77) “I give you the end of a golden string”
