Then there is the Codex, if we accept that FD behaviour identifies that an historical narrative was paused / removed then the codex become the sole repository of everything we ought to need. A good analogy is ‘what would a new player see’.

They only see the codex and the lore presented to them via tourist beacons etc. they should not need to read every aspect of the wider universe to understand nor interact with it.

Over the past month ive reset my Raxxla hunt, started a new XL sheet and I'm now only looking at it from the perspective of a new player.
What in game leads me to Raxxla? and only things that are in game.
Im literally leaving all my external books on the shelf, all my knowledge of everyone involved in the game (Holdstock, Drew etc) and trying to look at it with fresh eyes.

I think we are over complicating things - after all its a little bit obvious isn't it
