I think everything in game is intentional placed.

But not everything is relevant.

Much I presume is background narrative, that breaths life into the game, it gives it context, it might not all be directly linked to Raxxla.

But maybe some things, which we may not currently know of, are linked to Raxxla, but themselves are themselves background narrative.

I donâ€™t think collectively they can be joined up directly to identify something specific, but certainly they establish something is out there and could be found, at most they may advocate some spacial orientation.

I am as always pessimistically optimistic.
