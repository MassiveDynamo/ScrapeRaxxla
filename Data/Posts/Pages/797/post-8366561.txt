Regardless of what Raxxla is, I think joining the Dark Wheel is key. Either they already know where it is and you get access by joining them, or you get access to clues when joining them, so you can hunt it down.
Unless something has changed, TDW hasn’t found Raxxla. I think that a player will evetually get thier name on it. That’s the point of the mystery.

Clues from TDW is likely though. These may well be esential to even start the quest for Raxxla.
