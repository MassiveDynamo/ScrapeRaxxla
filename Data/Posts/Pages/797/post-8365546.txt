Well for this particular sound, you need music to be on.

which makes me suspect a background effect rather than something, but worth investigating.

@alexzk: incidentally, you remarked on the speed of my Deadly ranking. I'm only getting about 1% per hour, cos I'm old & slow; the fastest method seems to be to kill the system authority Vipers at the Checkpoint in an Anarchy system in Outbreak, but they're too aggressive for me! I got 5 or 6 Elites all opening up on me at the same time & the shields in my engineered corvette were disappearing rapidly. You do need to kill only targets of much higher rank than yourself, So Elite & Deadly recommended.
