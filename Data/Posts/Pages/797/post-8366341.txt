My theory is that we'll need to get invited to The Dark Wheel before we are able to see or access their hidden station. I assume several players already got to Elite in all ranks but received no special invitation? I myself still need to level combat rank (Dangerous 28%) and have no CQC rank. Was wondering if any got to Elite in all four.
