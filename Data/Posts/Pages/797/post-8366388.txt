My theory is that we'll need to get invited to The Dark Wheel before we are able to see or access their hidden station. I assume several players already got to Elite in all ranks but received no special invitation? I myself still need to level combat rank (Dangerous 28%) and have no CQC rank. Was wondering if any got to Elite in all four.
I think one Elite rank is enough actually. You get access to Shinrarta, which should be the key.
Or if any it should be the exploration Elite rank, as TDW are said to be explorers and mystery seekers.

Gosh, if you'd need CQC rank to get acces we'd all be screwed!

Edit:
Hey, maybe Raxxla is that artifact or one of those they found on Mars in the early 2100s. Just a thought.
