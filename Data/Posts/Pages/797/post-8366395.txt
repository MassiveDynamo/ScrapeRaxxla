Hi everybody. How are you all? I took an extended break as I realized I was spending WAY to much looking for a certain planet. Logged back in today for the 1st time in 5/6 months and was a little shocked to find no fleet carriers, no interstellar initiatives. In fact I'm so surprised by events that I have to ask.....we any closer to finding it?

Welcome back! But
Planet?
It’s a tourist beacon

(I’ll get my coat...)

Edit: Interstellar Initiatives, like much else, seems to be in lockdown while resources are diverted onto development of the next release (and Covid can’t be helping), I think that will be a major step in the progress of the game, with major Klaxian invasion.....

Fleet Carriers are in beta (or soon to be), but reaction appears largely to have been lukewarm; delends on your playstyle, personally I’m not interested. See various YT for reactions (ObsidianAnt, Exigeous, DTOA etc).

Edit2: I’m developing my “personal journey”; at present murdering Thargoid Scouts in the Pleiades in an attempt to get my third Elite rank, just in case it’s needed. Takes me back 35 years!
A single Elite rank gets you into Shinrarta Dezhra but that seems to have been a red herring as far as TDW and Raxxla is concerned, but I keep remembering the phrase from the original Holdstock novella
“
One thing's for sure,' Rafe went on drily. 'Unless you get there, unless you become élite, you'll never get to Raxxla.
”
And it was Combat elite in those days!
