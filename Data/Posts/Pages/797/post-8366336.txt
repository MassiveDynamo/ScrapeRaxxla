Hi everybody. How are you all? I took an extended break as I realized I was spending WAY to much looking for a certain planet. Logged back in today for the 1st time in 5/6 months and was a little shocked to find no fleet carriers, no interstellar initiatives. In fact I'm so surprised by events that I have to ask.....we any closer to finding it?
You're as close as we are
