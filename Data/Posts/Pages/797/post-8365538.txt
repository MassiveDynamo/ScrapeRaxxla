Sound recording advice from the old Canonn UA thread:
ED sound recording
There are a few tricks to assist your audio detection rate:
If you can change "Windows Sounds, Playback-devices" the you device and the tab for "Advanced". Select 24Bit 48000HZ or better.
In Elite, Audio options: Select "Night Time" mode. And you can safely disable music. (Screenshot provided at the end of the video)
Fly as silent as you possibly can. F/A Off will turn off the engines. Intermittently turn F/A on if you need to adjust your course
better still switch to your external camera and move the camera as close to the source of the noise as you can leaving ship at a distance.

In Audacity you can switch the track to spectogram mode which makes it a bit easier to see if there is something interesting embedded.
On the track next to the X is a drop-down menu usually labelled "Audio Track" in the menu you can select spectogram mode
In the same menu is "Spectogram Settings"
Algorithm: Frequencies
Window Size: 4096
Window Type: Guassian (a=3.5)
You might find changing max frequency to 5000 or so might make something pop out. If you see anything that looks like an image you might want to have a fiddle with settings to tray and get a better image

Well for this particular sound, you need music to be on.
