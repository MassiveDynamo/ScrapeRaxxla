Finishing up operation SAR; sold all rares in SOL, and Tau Ceti. Accendentially sold all my Mechucos High Tea, so before finishing my last batch in Shinrarta Dezhra, I'll pop back to Brandenstein Port which is 500kls off

I certainly think you can call collecting all known rares a personal journey, unfortunately nothing has happened yet, Fingers crossed for Shinrarta Dezhra!

Edit: Fingers crossed didn't help. Nothing happened. Operation SAR was unsuccessful and is now complete.
