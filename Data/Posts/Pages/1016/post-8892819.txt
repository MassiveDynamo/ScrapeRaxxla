Has there been a discussion about translating "To the whisperer of witchspace" not necessarily as a place per se but a spot. When I look at it I can interpret it something that communicates to you or had communicated with someone in space. Much like former President Halsey, or the first person who got interdicted by the thargoid. It can be a significant timeline where there was some sort of signal that was captured.

Edit: We did talk about but I'm not sure how far into we got, We look into the Gen. Ship, Missing President situation, but that's all I can remember we looked into.

I pointed out that “whisperer” has two disparate meanings; it can mean a person who communicates in a whisper (i.e. quietly), or it can mean a person who is an expert or has an unusual talent in a particular field (e.g. horse whisperer). It can also imply someone who tells secrets
