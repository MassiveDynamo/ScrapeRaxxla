I still think the word jewel is being used as a description or maybe a metaphor for it's importance, or must be valued. And mother must signify it's greatness compared to all galaxies. Much like how some use the expression "We hit the Mother Lode". Basically from this stand point everything that is said and is viewed through The Dark Wheel which has meaning to them since this is there supposed Toast to Raxxla.
