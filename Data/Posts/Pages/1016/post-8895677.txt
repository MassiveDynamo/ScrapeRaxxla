or, since breadcrumbs would lead to a quick discovery if they were in any way real ...

“To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies = the concept of leaving to the next star
To the whisperer in witchspace, the siren of the deepest void = the personification of the mysterious path travelled in your journey
The parent's grief, the lover's woe, and the yearning of our vagabond hearts = The concept of leaving home, having a calling that goes beyond relationships ...the search for the unknown and the unseen
To Raxxla!” = like how we use "holy grail" or "white whale / moby " ...the thing that is never found but drives the explorers to keep looking.

It's a simple poem that is like an explorer's mantra. nothing more. I think when fdev said that the mystery would have to be a little bit obvious is just that raxxla isn't going to be an abstract concept or hidden in some corner of the galaxy in some random system. That's it. They're not going to have any kind of hint or "puzzle" that solving leads you any closer to raxxla. And any puzzles that flesh out the dark wheel wouldn't bring you any closer to raxxla as they're no closer to finding it than any random cmdr and they've had way longer to look. If the lore is in any way reliably coherent anymore.
