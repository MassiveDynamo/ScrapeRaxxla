I pointed out that “whisperer” has two disparate meanings; it can mean a person who communicates in a whisper (i.e. quietly), or it can mean a person who is an expert or has an unusual talent in a particular field (e.g. horse whisperer). It can also imply someone who tells secrets

Also consider the possibility that "To the whisperer in witchspace, the siren of the deepest void!" is referring to the same thing. I often wondered whether the toast is actually implying that there are only three 'steps', with each complete sentence describing multiple aspects of a single entity.

To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies!
To the whisperer in witchspace, the siren of the deepest void!
The parent's grief, the lover's woe, and the yearning of our vagabond hearts. To Raxxla!

Another point worth considering is the nature in which punctuation is used. For example, step 1 and 2 both end with an exclamation mark, while the 3rd uses a period followed by "To Raxxla!". This could be interpreted to mean that Raxxla itself is the parent's grief, lover's woe and the yearning of our vagabond hearts (or at least that the final step involves finding something related to Raxxla).

This theory works best when you plug in Greek mythology, since there are several stories that align nicely with each one.
