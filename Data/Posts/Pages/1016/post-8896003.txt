If the "To" is the separator, there are three steps. That sounds resonnable.

The toast is used by the Dark Wheel. The Dark Wheel has yet to find Raxxla, so the 'map' is most likely not complete.
The Jewel sounds pretty concrete. I suspect they know that one.
The Whisper / Siren may be a location or an action that has to be taken (while in the Jewel system?)
Raxxla is the goal. It's not a real step. Figure out the fir two and you are there.

you led me to a brilliant idea that in principle allows us to start looking for something more specific!
Recently I read a book by balad about beta-2 and what you wrote gave me this thought:
A nebula is usually called a pearl or a jewel (translation difficulties, but not the essence), which means that the first line speaks of some specific nebula, the idea has just been born, so I don't know which one. But I dare to suggest that one of the options may be a nebula that is visible from the SOL.
the toast can be rephrased as follows:
1. need nebula name
2.go there
3. there you will find something.

upd - nebula cassiopeia?
