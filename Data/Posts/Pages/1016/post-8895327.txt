I'm about to head back into the bubble with over 100 mil worth of exploration data. Does anyone have requests for factions/locations they'd like to see it turned in to? There are a few dozen options and I'm finding it difficult to decide.

This was unfortunately one of my problems with the three-part theory. We know that the toast has been translated into several languages and they've all been cross-referenced by the community. Hence, it's unlikely that the separation means anything. Though it's certainly not impossible.

In leu of your points (and IF the toast is a clue), it seems more likely that there isn't a prose and the clues are simply keywords to be associated with astronomical observations.

I like the hypothesis of keywords associated with astronomical observations
