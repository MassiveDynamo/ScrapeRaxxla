If the "To" is the separator, there are three steps. That sounds resonnable.

The toast is used by the Dark Wheel. The Dark Wheel has yet to find Raxxla, so the 'map' is most likely not complete.
The Jewel sounds pretty concrete. I suspect they know that one.
The Whisper / Siren may be a location or an action that has to be taken (while in the Jewel system?)
Raxxla is the goal. It's not a real step. Figure out the fir two and you are there.

Iâ€™m working on a similar interpretation- the hypothesis that the first line is an instruction to go to the Jewel system, and then the rest of the verse provides instructions within the system to the location of Raxxla which is stealthed and will need you to be close and honking a lot to stand a chance of it revealing itself...I think RNGeesus applies!! Any young ladies from Lave wish to volunteer for a sacrifice?
