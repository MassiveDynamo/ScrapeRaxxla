Figure I clear this up cause I made this mistake before without noticing it but there is no "To" for the siren, it's just " To the whisperer of witchspace, the siren of the deepest void".

Which can correlate between the two, whisperer, and siren are all to me calls to or from something, sirens enchants there targets, just as much as whispering witch.

No, think you misunderstood what I was saying. There are indeed three explicit usages of the word “to”, but since this is English, and moreover English poetry, the word might be implicit, so up to 7 implied instances of the word.

It just adds to the potential obfuscation!
