I'm about to head back into the bubble with over 100 mil worth of exploration data. Does anyone have requests for factions/locations they'd like to see it turned in to? There are a few dozen options and I'm finding it difficult to decide.

Edit:
Mmm, English is an ambiguous language; much meaning is dependent on the context. And this is poetry, which further stretches the conventions for interpretation. So
“To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies
To the whisperer in witchspace, the siren of the deepest void
The parent's grief, the lover's woe, and the yearning of our vagabond hearts
To Raxxla!”
can have multiple interpretations.
1) only three lines have “To” so only 3 directions- to the jewel, to the whisperer AND siren, to Raxxla
2) the “to” can apply to every clause, so 7 directions
3) to the jewel, to the whisperer, to the siren, to Raxxla, so 4 directions
4) since the location/direction of Raxxla is unknown the rest of the toast should logically provide directions to it. That gives 6 clauses so 6 possible directions, or 3 if you ignore the third line of grief/woe/yearning. Either of these possibilities might tie in to the hexagonal symmetry of the Raxxla logo in the Codex.

This was unfortunately one of my problems with the three-part theory. We know that the toast has been translated into several languages and they've all been cross-referenced by the community. Hence, it's unlikely that the separation means anything. Though it's certainly not impossible.

In leu of your points (and IF the toast is a clue), it seems more likely that there isn't a prose and the clues are simply keywords to be associated with astronomical observations.
