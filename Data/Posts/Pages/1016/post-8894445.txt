Witch's Reach

Tracked a ship from Union of Ditibi Revolutionary Party departing from Serebrov Gateway to Witch's Reach. Tried to follow the wake, but no permit...

Have you ever looked at the cargo of ships going to Witch's reach? I had the thought last night that maybe a specific combination of cargo is needed to try to access hidden areas in the game. I was looking at others talk about "a door that is also a key", and I came to the conclusion that there is a material in-game that fits that descriptor - Meta-alloys.

Meta-alloys are the material used by Thargoids presumably in the manufacturing and operation of their vessels. In a sense, they are the key to the power that they exude, but it is also the doorway to Thargoid Witchspace, accessible only when a Goid vessel high wakes out of the system. Just my two cents. Raxxla's on my mind
