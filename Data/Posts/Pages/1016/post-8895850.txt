I don't think so. XX was just impossible combination for zx-spectrum name generator and was used as placeholder for something like numbers added or any chars. That's why it was used in promotion. Author just invented nice sound name which will not happen 100% in any random galaxy in game.

The origin of the word Raxxla predates Elite 1984 by quite a bit, as it appears in the same author's work 'The Alien World' published in 1980. He probably just re-used it 'cause he liked it.. names can be hard for authors.
