Figure I clear this up cause I made this mistake before without noticing it but there is no "To" for the siren, it's just " To the whisperer of witchspace, the siren of the deepest void".

Which can correlate between the two, whisperer, and siren are all to me calls to or from something, sirens enchants there targets, just as much as whispering witch.
If the "To" is the separator, there are three steps. That sounds resonnable.

The toast is used by the Dark Wheel. The Dark Wheel has yet to find Raxxla, so the 'map' is most likely not complete.
The Jewel sounds pretty concrete. I suspect they know that one.
The Whisper / Siren may be a location or an action that has to be taken (while in the Jewel system?)
Raxxla is the goal. It's not a real step. Figure out the fir two and you are there.

Example of possible interpretation:
Find the Jewel (we may need TDW's help on theis one)
Jump from the Jewel to all neighbouring systems and listen for strange sounds in witchspace.
Use sound data (strength and direction) to map a direction.
Go back to jewel and supercruise in that direction until you hit gold.
