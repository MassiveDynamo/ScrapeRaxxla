Also there was an interesting forum conversation stating that Raxxla wasn't capable of FTL itself and so it has been travelling at sub FTL speeds...wherever it went.

The idea that Raxxla is a rogue planet that was once a moon of Lave and is moving around from system to system comes from Drew Wagar's Oolite novels. I doubt that it has any relevance to the Raxxla in Elite: Dangerous.
