So I can't see FD putting Raxxla outside the bubble. It needs to have a chance at being found and considering less than 1% of the game is explored they would hide it under our noses, otherwise I doubt these servers would be online long enough to even find it. People would have long quit. Also there was an interesting forum conversation stating that Raxxla wasn't capable of FTL itself and so it has been travelling at sub FTL speeds...wherever it went. Using some rough/ generalized math the OP felt it was under 1000ly of its original position at Lave 2, centuries earlier. 1000ly being the worse case, and possibly assuming light travel, but not faster than(?), and possibly assuming a constant travel, but it's undoubtedly been parked in a other system most of that time. This would make sense to me. Otherwise you're putting a huge secret in the game that nobody may ever find. And supposedly it was stated there'd be no hints. Now maybe you have to collect/ unlock something far away to access Raxxla, sure. And maybe it has something to do with those confusing Unstable Data Cores in the Colonia crash site...that'd be cool. Because if you read the listening post reports regarding that ship...well, someone didn't want that pilot to talk, or get away from the bubble in the first place. And players don't know what to do with these cores.

Anyway wherever Raxx is FD must be confident it will be found. To be that confident it must be sitting in some Col, HIP or Shu Wei system.
I'D like for it to be far because far is where I'm at and am not planning a return to the bubble any time soon. When I do I'm buying a Sidewinder, in Colonia, and crashing into the planet and not accepting rebuy because I will be so spent on travel...I already am.
