Which live stream? The one from yesterday? Also where in the livestream was this? At what time?

Yeah, the Lavecon review one. I can't remember and honestly can't be bothered to go back and find them. One was middish way in, the other was almost at the very end, both times it was a response to something in chat, they never brought it up themselves. Sandro (I think) played over the first one as some sort of spider joke and the second time everyone just grinned and looked at camera.
