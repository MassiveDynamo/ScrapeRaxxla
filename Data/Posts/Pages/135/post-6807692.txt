Fair enough...although it being in the building bybble seems astronomically improbable. Besides...didn't I read/hear somewhere that the bubble is nearly completely discovered at this point?

If you go out from the star far enough, might even be in Sol.......perhaps off the ecliptic. Seem to remember a comment by MB along those lines (without actually giving any clue whatsoever, was generic about “things” not having been found, off the beaten path)
