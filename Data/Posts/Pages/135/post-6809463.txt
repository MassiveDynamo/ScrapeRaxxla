Apologies folks, I am not an expert at these things - how is the jump range of 467Ly achieved with the MkIII above? Is it to do with the fuel tanks?

Question...has anyone attempted this in a stock MKIII? Maybe by some wild chance the Cobra MKIII is the key. Seems weird he would specifically mention the Cobra MKIII. i'd imagine that to be the rough range of a few ships. Including Viper MKIV/ III. Where was this quoted anyway? THere may have been other hints in what he said. And while he may have mentioned range he seems not to have mentioned accessibility, permits and the like lol.

Also it really might not be in Polaris. Polaris is just a connection many have made. I'm wondering if it's just in a Col sector or something. Polaris might just be a future content thing, or other mystery.
