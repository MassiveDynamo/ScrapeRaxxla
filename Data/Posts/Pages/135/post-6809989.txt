I tried getting to Polaris with a stock MKIII, just in case there was any significance... It's not gonna happen, unless there are a chain of neutron stars, and there aren't. I ran out of fuel long, long before Polaris, and not long after the last outpost, which was only about 218ly from Polaris. I even tried efficient plotting and it maps the same as quickest plot, due, to there being little stars to select from and leaving me with no alternatives. I set out from Sirius space because they sell the MKIII. Either way I couldn't plot directly to Polaris, due, to permit blocking, but plotted to stars leading up to it.
