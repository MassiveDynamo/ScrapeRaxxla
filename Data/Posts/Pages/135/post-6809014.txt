Not quite. We've just always assumed that those missions were a reference to Raxxla.

Oh yes, Doc. I meant The Myth. Sorry.
The Myth is obfuscated in the outer rim. I just hope we are not chasing Cirag, Soontill (the true one) or Shangri La, but just chymeras as most of us are fond of ... Aren't we, Doc ?

But first we need to know: outer rim of what and when?

A Cmdr is telling to another Cmdr about the outer rim. What could he possibly be speaking about ? He is located out of the Solar System when speaking. So imho we can reject the 'SS outer rim', besides we never heard of such thing... Could be the outer rim of the Bubble which is what I am exploring due to the '190 Ly from Ticushpakhi pattern' of the E/F missions.
But again, I seriously doubt of our FDevs consistency in matter of story lines...
When ? Well, in this ED universe, where even light is faster than light, the 'when' (time) parameter is slippy ground ... That's why I never PvP a noob Sidewinder. Could be my double myself starting playing the game three years ago (in his proper time)...[haha]
