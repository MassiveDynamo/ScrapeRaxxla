Scepticism is good and indeed a requisite for the polite intelligent discussion of ideas and hypotheses about Raxxla that we undertake in this thread.

However we see frequent repetition of claims that it hasn't been found in X years so it can’t exist, or it must be located close to Sol because (for any number of weak logical reasons, plus an occasional one that’s sensible ), or it’s the friends/numpties/trolls you’ve met along the way, or it’s a journey with no destination, or ...

This is a friendly thread and we always welcome useful contribution. But there’s a difference between scepticism and rudeness/ trolling. We don’t have to listen to the latter. Personally I always put the latter on my ignore list.
