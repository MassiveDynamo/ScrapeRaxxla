There's no doubt that the search for Raxxla is frequently frustrating and I have felt the need to take a step back and just explore for its own sake, or race, or help out with Turning the Wheel, Op Ida or anything else that catches my fancy for when I am feeling burned-out. (Or when my fingers need a rest, like now). It is often when I take a break that I have an idea I can test (by which I mean falsify).

It is great that there are so many of us here thinking in different ways. Fundamentally, we have not made progress but that could change in an instant, with a single clue being found that had been missed before. We are throwing ideas at the wall and at some point one of them is going to stick. That first part is the hardest. So keep the ideas coming!

If in doubt, go back to the beginning, in-game. I think Tau Ceti is set up as being the starting point by the Codex, so visit the Tourist Beacons, land at the main stations (not all the Odyssey ones - not even sure how many were added but they are all procedural afaik, or is that an assumption to test?). Tug on those straws and see what comes loose. Somewhere there is a lead that has not been followed up yet by someone who realises it is what we are after here.

Fly safe and enjoy the ride! o7
