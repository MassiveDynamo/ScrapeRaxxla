Jokes aside, with all due respect, the last 1000 pages of this thread didn't produce any new ideas or insights into the matter. I have every right to sprinkle some skepticism into it, especially considering many of the contributors here are just feeding into their own bubble and retracing past steps for the Xth time. Learn to deal with skepticism and criticism, because it won't just go away on your demand.
Nothing wrong with founded criticism. Random accusations of dishonesty though are just flinging fists in the dark, they won't find their mark and are easily dismissable, being baseless - and pointless. Not sure what you're trying to achieve tbh. As I said, you won't change anyone's mind.
