They wouldn't place it around a proc generated Y dwarf to be found by pure chance. As the probability to be found would be less than Earth being hit by an asteroid in the years since the game released.



The rumors about Raxxla are as old as spacefaring itself, canonically speaking. Means that it's either just a myth and doesn't exist, or it's really close to Earth/Sol.



"Could be anywhere" equals "Isn't anywhere". You don't put company time in something random that will never be found, unless it's so easy to implement and so underwhelming that the prospect of finding it becomes uninviting.

Why wouldnt Fdev put it somewhere out of the way in an unremarkable system? Some people on this thread have been searching for 8 years... Ive been searching for 5. It could be a remarkably astute FDev marketing ploy to keep people playing! Don’t mistake wishful thinking for sound hypothesising based on game lore i.e. the rules FDev have set themselves.

‘"Could be anywhere" equals "Isn't anywhere" ‘ is totally false and illogical reasoning. The in-game rumour has existed since the earliest days of spaceflight does imply Raxxla should be in or very near Sol where humanity originated. However there is absolutely no lore that says Raxxla has actually ever been found by anyone! It might only have ever been a rumour (I’m not saying that, because DB and MB have both said it is in-game and MB has also said it can be found, implying it is an in-game object of some form). Moreover the myth of Raxxla might legitimately have arisen through in-game astronomical observations, which puts it back possibly anywhere in the game universe.
