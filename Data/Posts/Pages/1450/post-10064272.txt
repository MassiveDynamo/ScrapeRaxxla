As for the rest, I've read your theories and musings multiple times out of the 500 times you shared them. There might be something to it, or not. Far god knows.
All I ask is that any ideas be let develop until something approaching some level of proof appears. No one has found The Dark Wheel station so we really cannot be certain they actually exist. We all contribute towards advancing any viable ideas. Because, as of right now, we have rumors with many questions attached to them. Even I am not fool-hardy enough to claim what I have developed amounts to actual proof. Robert Garry could just be some random pirate. If anything, I haven't been able to help because we have more questions about what to trust than we have solid answers.
