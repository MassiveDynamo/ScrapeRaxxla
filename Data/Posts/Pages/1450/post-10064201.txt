The in-game rumour has existed since the earliest days of spaceflight does imply Raxxla should be in or very near Sol where humanity originated. However there is absolutely no lore that says Raxxla has actually ever been found by anyone!

It if was never found or observed by anyone, then there is no truth to the rumors and the myth itself and you're wasting your time. There has to be a progenitor of the story, otherwise it's just a fairytale.

Why wouldnt Fdev put it somewhere out of the way in an unremarkable system?

Again, it can be in an unremarkable system somewhere close, with clues pointing to it.
It won't be in an unremarkable system on the other side of the galaxy, with no clues pointing to it, because that's just an absurd waste of dev time and assets for something that probably won't be found in hypothetical 300 years.
