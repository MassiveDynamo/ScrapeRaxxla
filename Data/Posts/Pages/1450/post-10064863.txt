My advice: The history here is shady as heck. There are apparently one or more groups with an agenda that are not keen on letting the past be widely known. Re-evaluation of what we know may be necessary. This is why I am taking at least some time to re-evaluate what we know to see if other details appear that give a path forward. Small details can have big consequences.

I am partly doing this as a means to verify if existing conclusions and suspected direction the lore appears to be taking are on solid grounding. Think of it as double-checking to make sure the direction this appears to taking is actually reasonable.
