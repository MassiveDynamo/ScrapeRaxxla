Given recent developments on this thread, I switching temporarily to a more bio-focused research mode. Will report back as warranted but something about the lore up to this point involving Thargoids possibly doesn't fit well with what Thargoids are supposed to be like. I am mentally going over systems in hotspot regions of historical Thargoid conflicts and I really hope I'm wrong here.
