Nothing wrong with founded criticism. Random accusations of dishonesty though are just flinging fists in the dark, they won't find their mark and are easily dismissable, being baseless - and pointless. Not sure what you're trying to achieve tbh. As I said, you won't change anyone's mind.
Nothing about it is random, it wouldn't be the first time they are being dishonest. It's not really something personal, just how business works. We were led to believe that Thargoids had their own BGS in the past, until master Derin spilled the beans in a recent stream and told everyone that it was devs "playing chess" against the players.

You may not like it, but that's your problem, not mine. So I recommend you follow your own advice and stop flinging fists in the dark. I assume you have better things to do.
