I seen this before it's just players messing with the Heatmap image.

Agreed, check out the Fuel rats logo on the GalMap video if you haven't seen it. And the thing in the bottom left, to me, looks like a pretty good copy of the original 1984 Space Stations, if it is, whoever did that, well done!

Happy Raxxla to all at this time of year (we don't know its not a greeting so Im seeing if that does anything )
