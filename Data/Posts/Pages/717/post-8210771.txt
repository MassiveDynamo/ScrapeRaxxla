I figured out which thing is not in jameson atm. It's the local pilots federation. Should they be in jameson?!

Is it possibly signifigant that TDW is possibly running SD now?

NVM, found them in another station. But why are they absent from jameson. Has this always been the case?

Edit: Nvm, again. They own one base but are not a minor faction there. How were they removed from the system. They do not have minor faction status in any base in SD? If TDW gets that last base(s) will ownership move over? Local PF currently own one landable base and 3 NPC bases in SD.

Was local PF never a minor faction. I thought they were usually present to gain rep with. TDW also has 30.9% influence and is the major influence in the system. And all 100% of the influence is accounted for in the system between the existing 4 minor factions. I swore TPF used to have a minor faction there.
