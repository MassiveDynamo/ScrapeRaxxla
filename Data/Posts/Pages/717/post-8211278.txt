The name confusion is mentioned in a section of the Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophel_and_Stella

Personally I'm most intrigued by the actual title page (second edition. Not first, as I said in the previous post)
SPOILER

There are a few interesting bits.


A bit of text on the bottom is hidden.

I like the idea that there is a clue in the writing on the cover page. Could 'The jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies' be the ''In the Ring there is the Ruby sett'?
The reference to 'comly shape, & vertue both are mett' is the beauty of body and soul, although in an Elite Dangerous context it makes me think of Heart and Soul.
Could the jewel be in/around the Heart and Soul nebulae? Any systems that might match that description out there spring to mind for anyone?
