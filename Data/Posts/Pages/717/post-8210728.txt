1. At 38-39 seconds there are two odd artifacts from player actions. One is on the far left bottom and looks like a ship from the original elite. is this a cobra mkIII. If so maybe it's a hint and Fdev new of this space drawing from back in the day and what the codex stuff or other info about beign within jump range of a corbramk III means. Maybe it's from that position on the heat map.

2. There is a name on the far bottom right. What does it say? SPARNEEJUAH?

Later there is also a spiral pattern a few circles and boxes. KARAYA at the top of the map. I wonder if anyone found raxxla or anything and did this to mark it not expecting this to be findable. Do we know what all of those are?

Also, a perfect 5 pointed star and a star that is basically a bunch of lines intersecting a point. I assume bots were used to perfectly make shapes. also some boxes with angles making a point. Could Fdev been watching such a heat map and make clues based on potentially patterns made by people or bots trying to demonstrate they found certain things in the game?

Some of the 2d shapes are 3d:

Could any of this be pointing out important locations?
