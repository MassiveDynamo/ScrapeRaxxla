I’d be interested to hear your reasoning on that compadre!

I’m still working on Sol/Earth then Sirius/Lucifer for the first two lines, but am stuck on grief & woe. It struck me that Sol & Sirius are both permit locked. It could finally make sense of system locks if obtaining them is part of the “personal journey”. Triton could be the parent’s grief (death of Pallas) & Luna (Selene in greek myth) might be the lover’s woe, but we have no idea how to get those two permits (though I noted yesterday that a wiki entry has them as locked by Mother Gaia!). There must be a reason for system permits since FD inserted military convoys into Witch’s Reach...must be some gameplay involved there somehow!!!

Happy Christmas to all!
Dog had his second seizure at 03:00, so stunned & shattered in equal measure. Just having strong coffee so I’ll be fit to drive him round for vet inspection in a few minutes. Not a great start to Xmas!

Sorry to hear about the dog Jorki...

The thoughts on my path... well we start in the elysian fields... the resting place of souls and the closest thing to a jewel on the edge of our galaxy. Head out across the rift with a wanderlust through the errant marches and end up in the eagles circle which kind of describes the dark wheel logo on the edge of the void...where sirens are calling... currently guessing the dark wheel station is out there in aquilas halo. Slowly working my way there...
