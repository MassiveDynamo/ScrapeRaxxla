RAISING THE KING.
S.O.

The project to restore the Great Pyramid in the former state of Egypt on Earth is nearing completion. The final sections of stone facia are due to be erected in the next weeks, which means that the project should be open for public view before the end of the year. The public exhibition will chart the ancient history of the Pyramid, from its cosmic beginnings through modern ideas of its origins and purpose, its partial destruction and burial during the global war of the mid twenty-first century, to the recent reconstruction project. The project leader Lianne Dilingeris very happy with the progress made following the generous patronage of former Federation Executive Robert Lodge , without which, she says, the project would have collapsed.
