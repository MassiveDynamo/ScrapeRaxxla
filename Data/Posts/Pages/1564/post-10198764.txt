The pattern on that particular omphalos was unique I believe, it’s thought it may have been solely a decorative element to a larger work called ‘the dancers’, various omphalos stones were located all over the area at various temples across Greece, of varying sizes and shapes. No definitive record exists to identify what that pattern ascribed to, it could be a net, but more commonly a fabric pattern of cloth worn by priestesses, some ascribed the stone had a physical covering and was a callback to the myth of Cronos. Generally the stone has a mixed heritage and has at least 3-4 origin myths. On the context of Raxxla I highly doubt that pattern has any relevance other then an indication of an Axus Mundi.

Thanks for this - I forgot about the "dancers"
The dancers are the three fates… they are literally standing around the tree of life/axis - the strands of cloth that the fates weave are coming from the "omphalos" above... which is why it doesnt look like a swaddeling cloth - and why the omphalos is equated with the woumb - it is the ball of wool on the distaff (axis) before it goes to the spindle of necessity and the fates..... think Plato and the myth of Er.

Indras net is Fate - the Wheel of Fate... as a Net ... you cannot escape - its the same thing.

The wheel of fate of course being …the dark wheel…
