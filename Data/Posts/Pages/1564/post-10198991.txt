Ya Indras Net is what i think Holdstock envisioned for the universe machine that was to be the Talmor Lens.

I suspect raxxla to be more mundane - a gate or gate system tied to the axis (whatever axis that turns out to be). Maybe with Guardian AI at one end and The Far God at the other….

I do like the idea of a rift that takes us into into a pocket of space ( maybe the LMC) - the space inbetween…
