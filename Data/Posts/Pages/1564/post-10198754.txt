The pattern on that particular omphalos was unique I believe, it’s thought it may have been solely a decorative element to a larger work called ‘the dancers’, another structure which is on display in a museum where that image of the omphalos also resides, various other omphalos stones were located all over the area at various temples across Greece, of varying sizes and shapes it’s likely therefore this more elaborate design was decorative, whilst others were mere stone slabs (one theory ascribes early temples were built on meteorite strikes and totems carved from them!!!).. No definitive record exists to identify what that pattern ascribed to, it could be a net, but more commonly a net-like fabric pattern of cloth worn by priestesses, because there is no geometric continuity, some ascribed the stone had a physical covering and was a callback to the myth of Cronos. Generally the stone has a mixed heritage and has at least 3-4 origin myths. On the context of Raxxla I highly doubt that pattern has any relevance other than the stone as indication of an Axus Mundi.
