I agree that there is a good chance you can fly through a portal.
We already do that. This is more what in the heck is ripping open the wormhole? Not even a fusion power plant is actually capable of ripping a temporary hole in space-time. Fleet Carriers and our ships (per descriptions on FSD signatures) indicate something else opens the rift between systems. Get a FSD wake scanner and go scanning high wakes and low wakes. High wakes have an icon the looks like a wormhole. Low wakes looks like some sort of gate. I'd also challenge you to look at background stars (at approximately 60Â° relative to the tunnel) as you traverse the Witch-space tunnel (aka wormhole) and watch as space folds upon itself as you get ejected at your destination system.

Physics makes science fiction look mundane by comparison.
