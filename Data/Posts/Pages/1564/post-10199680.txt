Throwing this out there because we have a new entry to the Axis Mundi/Tree of Life/Yggradasil theorycrafting but it comes from Soontill Earth. You see Elvira Martuuk was correct in that Soontill Relics were an elaborate human fraud.



Hope this helps, @Rochester.

Consider this an unexpected gift from Martuuk.

As laboriously crafted objects, they testify to the concentration of power and resources in the hands of a small elite.

Elvira Martuuk is a well known explorer although she is rumoured to have once been a deadly assassin before heading out into black. Some have claimed she needed to 'cool off' after a particularly high profile case, so went exploring, but Elvira denies it. She is fascinated by all things alien, and has become expert at spotting human fakes. Her reputation is such that her base is rarely troubled by freebooters. She believes in being self-sufficient, and her tight-knit group grows all their own food. Develop your relationship with her to discover another engineer.
