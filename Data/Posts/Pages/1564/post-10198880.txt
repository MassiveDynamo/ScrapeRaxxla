I think Raxxla is something that you can fly through, which will transport you somewhere. The problem with this is what the player will find on the other side (and whether they can come back the same way!). The Magellanic Clouds or a distant star cluster are both options but what would one find there that we cannot already find elsewhere in the Milky Way? Alien ruins of the civilisation that built the gateway? Maybe - but it would require as many assets as the Guardians use right now, at a minimum. An active spacefaring civilisation is probably unlikely as that would require even more work to build.

Ultimately, I view the Quest for Raxxla as a Quest for Change. The objective is to find something that will teach us something profound about the history of our galaxy and our place in it. Something that will change how we see the Universe, change the context of our decision-making, so that nothing would seem the same afterwards. Epiphany.

No pressure, FD
