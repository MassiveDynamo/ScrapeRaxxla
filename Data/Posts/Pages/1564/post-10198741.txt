Indra is an indo-european storm god (think thor or zeus) - and mount meru is a navel with a net on it … just like the omphalos … both symbols of the world axis.

Im not saying it isnt swaddling cloth on the omphalos - but when you look at classical figures of rhea handing over the “swaddled “ stone -it looks like cloth. But on the versions of the various omphaloi- it looks like a net. At the very least they are different stories that seem to be describing something of very similar nature.
