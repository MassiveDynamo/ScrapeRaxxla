Also, if you own a fleet carrier you have a class-4 FSD. Carriers, megaships, and Dredgers use the same technology developed by Argent Almagmated Aerospace Inc. In other words, if you own a carrier, you have a Quest-class vessel.

MINER/PROCESSORS - A NEW DEVELOPMENT IN FUEL TECHNOLOGY

M.C.S

Engineers and technologists at the New Rossyth Shipyard are developing a new generation of mining machines capable of converting base nuclear ores into fuel suitable for use by the new ‘Class 4’ military drives. A redevelopment of the core reactor in the ‘Class 4’ enables the drive to use a wider range of semi-stable fuels with an improved fuel conversion ratio - in crude terms, there is more ‘thrust per tonne’ than in the old ‘Class 3’ engines. The new M/Ps can be transported and landed in the same way as the old-style mining machines and are designed to make use of the wider range of potential fuels by mining, extracting and processing the raw materials to create fuel rods in the format required by the new ‘Class 4’ drives. If it works, this innovation removes the one of the last barriers to infinite distance deep space travel, however, to be effective, the machines have to survive long periods unattended in a wide variety of planetary environments and this has yet to be tested.
