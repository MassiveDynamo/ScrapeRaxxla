Current obsession; 'The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia'. The potential correct source for 'Astrophil and the Spiralling Stars'

"a striking resemblance to the children's story "Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars" (and consequently became discredited)"

First written by Philip Sidney circa 1580 whilst he was in his 20s it originally was intended for his little sister, who was 8 years his younger.

The name Astrophil is a play on words for Philips own name, but what if 'Princess Astrophil' is in fact supposed to indicate the feminine aka 'Mary Sidney'... and it certainly was written for a child.

Mary Sidney was also synonymous with the 'Star Chamber' court later in her life.

"She claims she's found a map to some pirate stash, and all I have to do is loan her my ship so we can go dig it up. Maybe we should go find Raxxla while we're at it!"

Arcadia is a pastoral story but it does indeed contain pirates, and a hidden pirate stash...and Cora / Kore / Persephone could be infurred by Arcadias themes of rebirth.

"Much like the ancient myths of Atlantis, El Dorado and the kingdom of Prester John, interpretations of the story range from the skeptical to the outlandish"

'The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia' is also a source material for its own outlandish myth, namely wrapped around the very peculiar 'Oak Island' mystery.

There's no mention of an omphalos but possibly a 'tree of knowledge'. Which may or may not be linked to Draco and the pole stars...as an axis mundi...

Early days but I'm more and more inclined to think 'Arcadia' is the intended source material.
