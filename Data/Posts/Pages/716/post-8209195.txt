If you try it and open Pandoraâ€™s box on us, sorry.

Speaking of Pandora, it could be a real Nemesis. Not only does the planet Pandora and Nemesis exist in Momus Reach, also the station Tatrarus Point is in system. The tartarus is very similar to Hades in that it was a place of torment and suffering for the wicked and was the prison for the Titans.
Worth mentioning is that the box was gifted to Pandora by Zeus, and Zeus is the father of Persephone.
