So, reading up on a lot of the Galnet archives and looking for any resemblance to the Raxxla, Dark Wheel codex. The word Utopia seem to come to mind based on the idea of El Dorado, Atlantis, and Kingdom of Prester John which can be described as places of utopian ideas.

-El Dorado which is viewed as society reaching prosperity
-Atlantis was considered a powerful society
-Kingdom of Pester John a society of knowledge

Now I'm not sure how many of you went in the route of pledging to Pranav Antal who wants to set a utopian society based on "peace prosperity through the advancement of ethically aligned technology." A lot that aligns with the 3 mention mythological cities

But looking into more of the Galnet archive I notice one interesting information that popped out to me the most.

Sim-Archives

The Sim-Archive, located in the Antal system, is Utopia's greatest achievement â€“ a vast digital repository containing the collective wisdom of all their departed brothers and sisters. Like any system, however, the Archive requires constant maintenance, as a failure in the system could result in the loss of irreplaceable knowledge. Pranav Antal stated that Utopia's ambition is to digitize the human consciousness and thereby transcend our physical selves.

Has anyone investigated the possibility of flowing information that might be used to progress the information given to the commanders?
