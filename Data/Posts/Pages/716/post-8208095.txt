Me too now, didn't mean anything by my edit but that older sayings are full of prejudice that go unseen (pun intended). Not that anyone here thinks that way or anything else.

Anyway, back to subject, someone mentioned an unscientific and lateral approach...count me in, I can help there for sure Its all this science that baffles me. No approach is less valid than any other and no matter what we do its probable that someone will stumble on Raxxla rather than be following a path...if its accessible to all in the first place.

And there may not be any 'clues' as such anyway, depends who wrote the story imo
