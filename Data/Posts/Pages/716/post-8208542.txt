Quick follow-up on the Asteroid Belt Clusters :

Seems their in-game representation is bugged, since they nowhere near represent their total Mass as shown in the System Map.

Example (very high Mass distributed amongst only 4 Resource Belt Clusters total) :
View attachment 156517

However, upon checking those 4 (which should be massive), I only saw the standard generic low-Asteroid count ones that are found everywhere.
Seems like a Bug, since back in the V1.x era this used to be different. Drop-out was as far as 100km out, with many thousands of Asteroids offering good Mining Grounds.
All that is apparently gone.

If anything, I'd say a 5-10 Asteroid count Belt Cluster would make for an exceptionally poor hiding place for stuff - and it seems that's all they offer now, all of them.

I think the belt mass also accounts for all the small undetectable masses that aren't in a cluster. The gravity from the belt mass is presumably evenly distributed in the region we can see in the orrery map for the system.
