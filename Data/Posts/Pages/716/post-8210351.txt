Something about the Simarchive does strike me as suspicious. I like your thoughts on this. I think looking further into it could be beneficial.



4) I believe We’ve been provided tools to aid in this search for Soontill. Thargoid Sensors, Probes, and Links. They just haven’t been deployed in the correct area perhaps. I have a few places I’d be very curious to see if these objects have a reaction in. Prism near the star Ruby or Anticlea, Soontill System itself (low priority system imo), and Zephyrus (aka the West Wind and a genus of a species of bee, Fibonacci also confused Zephyrum with Zephyrus a bit) near Violet World (“if you were to understand it all seek Fibonacci’s Zephrum”). Thargoid technology is also supposed to react violently when near Guardian technology so perhaps deploying them in space by Lucifer or the Simarchive can evoke different reaction.

If you try it and open Pandora’s box on us, sorry.

Acquring a Thargoid Link from HIP 19026, then headed for Prism. Any particular area in Prism I should release the Probe, Sensor and Link?

Edit: Entraces collapsed at HIP 19026 B1 C. I have a bad feeling about this.
