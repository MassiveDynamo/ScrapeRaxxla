Odd note. I was just posting something this: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threa...hich-system-is-it.477422/page-13#post-8209228
I went to a wiki to find the DW codex info and found this: https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Codex

Not in game atm, but I just ground rep for all of SD at jameson memorial and I'm pretty sure only 4 factions exist atm. Did one get kicked out?

BTW, going off my post, does anyone know a list of all sectors in the bubble? That would make it easier to search all special sequence systems within those sectors.
