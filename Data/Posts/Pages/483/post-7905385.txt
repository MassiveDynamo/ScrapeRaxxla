Ok as much as I have wanted the Thargoids and Raxxla to be separate mysteries.. my current theory is they are related

Thargoids are essentially space bees... insects flying flowerships harvesting meta-alloys like pollen and taking them back to their hive.... Incidentally i think what we are witnessing right now is bee swarming... during the formation of a new colony .. someone really should find that queen and kill her or we are in for some trouble.

And nope i havent given up on Hecate ... there are some good similarites between inner symbol of the raxxla icon and the thargoid and barnacle symbols ... And of course Hecate is associated with bees... My current tinfoil is that the Thargoids are partially tamed by "Hecate" acting as a bit of a bee-keeper which is siphoning off "Honey" created by the meta-alloys the Thargoids are collecting. And this is being used to power the Raxxla gate.... So yes i am now thinking the Raxxla gate is in Thargoid space.
