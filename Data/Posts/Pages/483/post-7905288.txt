I've been trying them on the black holes that I've come across while exploring towards the bottom right corner of the map.

as far as how far I was before initiating the jump? I was close enough to get the lensing effect to kick in on my next jump system.
It was me talking about it. Didn't work for the closest bh in S171 8. ( For you jorki) Also, the destination was 22.6ly.

I won't be trying this again for a while as I've learned that the bhs on here scare the hell out of me and I don't quite understand why lol.
