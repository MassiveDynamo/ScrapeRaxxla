Has anyone figured out where that station is yet?

no, location is obfuscated

edit: my hypothesis that the start screen shows Raxxla as a station is based on MB’s comment regarding Raxxla that “there will be no clues, but you have to make it a little bit obvious”, and the original ED start screen is the only thing that could be described as being obvious.
