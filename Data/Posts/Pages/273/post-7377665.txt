no, location is obfuscated

edit: my hypothesis that the start screen shows Raxxla as a station is based on MB’s comment regarding Raxxla that “there will be no clues, but you have to make it a little bit obvious”, and the original ED start screen is the only thing that could be described as being obvious.

The old missions which have been removed could also be considered a little bit obvious since they did not mention the name Raxxla afaik.
