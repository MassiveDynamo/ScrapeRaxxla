Parallax

The figure enters the bar after 3 years of exploration, handing you a list of steps

Gain Elite Status
Land on Shinrarta Dezhra A 1
Take multiple photographs fixated on various stars in the night sky (Be sure to record your planetary coordinates and timestamp each screenshot.)
Come back to the same spots in 5 days time.
Photograph the same stars again at the same locations.
Stack the Photos you've taken and look for moving objects.
Using your friend SohCahToa calculate the distance of the objects that moved and compare them with the objects in the System map.
There WILL be 1 object that does not match the system map... It is there you will find what you seek...

As the figure walks away from you he whispers "Remember Parallax!" or was it Raxxla?
