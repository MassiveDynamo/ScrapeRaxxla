Has anyone figured out where that station is yet?

Still searching, people still look for the 8th moon of a gaz giant; the problem is in 500 ly around sol (what EDSM and EDDB was able to give us) there still 2334 systems (my own research in progress) that need to be check.

I was under the impression the DW station was a different type completely, though I could very well be wrong.
Pretty sure myself is will be an hidden undockable station with some audio logs (like the zurara) and once discover maybe Fdev will change it. Only way to know at the moment would be to find something by datamining.
