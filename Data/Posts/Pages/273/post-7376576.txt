I don't think Raxxla is a planet

Raxxla is a certain celestial body, The Myth, but also a place that isn't a place.
A scientist may assume it's kind of a Black Hole... (As many players already stated and investigated)
But any Buddhist here to really enlighten us ?
(About BH, we can fly into them and be low waked. Maybe a small planet is obfuscated there. Undetectable untill you enter the exclusion zone, because of the Event Horizon thing. Raxxla would be obfuscated beyond the EH ! A device, construct, that exploits the BH to manage a stable wormhole.)
'Hey Mike, where are we going to hide Raxxla ? It must be undetectable!'
'Mmmh, that's true, Dave. In the MW but... what about inside a BH ?'
SPOILER

Also, would there be a clue by understanding the odd difference (inside the mind of the FDevs) between a celestial body and a stellar body ? What does the (crappy) FSS reveal ? Celestials or stellars ?
