Bingo.

But, on second look, I do think that the WW on the right doesn't depict a moon. I noticed that no part of it is overlapping the WW planet. For the ELW and Gas planet that is always the case (within or at least overlapping). So, I would think that the last white stone work circle farthest to the right may simply be a a small icy planet typical of so many systems we see. If this is a solar system its contains a lot of uniqueness which is intrguing to me. Just the fact that it is a system of limited numer of main planets alone makes it interesting.

I really wish folks (not you) wouldn't attack me for just making a personal observation and suggestion. I simply said when I look at this garder "I see..." I never said anything was a hard fact - sheesh. If people get attacked for trying to throw out some ideas then no ones going to want to share.

I do think that the Miltonian interpretation is fantastic and, in fact, is not a conflicting suggestion. Remember, the Miltonian identifiers could be depicted in many, many forms both geometriclly and textually. But the reality is it could have all been intended to be imbedded into solar system imagery for a reason. In a sense, the system I described could be the "miltionian solar system" to be found.

I will just say that in retospect, if we all step back and realize that the game we are playing is a space game; its a game of a galaxy filled with solar systems - many and varied.
So when I look at this garden I simply see the obvious (to me). The odds that all of the unique items I see that fit so perfectly into a solar system description - like one we could see any day of the week out in the black, I find it highly improbable that it was just a coincindence. But that's just my honest opinion.
