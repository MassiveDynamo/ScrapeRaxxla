It's clear that stations containing gardens were in-game from very early (2015 mentions), but I think the question to be answered is when did that specific garden design enter the game? The earliest evidence I can see is the Gamescom 2016 video.
It should be noted that there are other garden designs visible e.g. 1:15-1:24 mins in
