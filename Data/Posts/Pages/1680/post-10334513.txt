I'm starting to think the opposite - if the current Garden designs date from 2016 and the interview where MB says, in regards to Raxxla - 'no clues, but you have to make something a tiny bit obvious' is also 2016, could the current Gardens be the 'something a tiny bit obvious'?

The only thing that gives me pause is that, as far as I can tell, the Codex was introduced in December 2018.

But remember the PF/DW missions - which did reflect upon Raxxla indirectly, by referring to the DW novella quotation. Also utilised Miltonian language. Then importantly, they were removed.

The Codex came afterwards.

We don’t know what the narrative nor resolution those missions could have evolved into.

FD much later, and only upon being pressed, admitted them gone ‘that story’ was removed. So if these gardens are related, they pre-date the codex.

They could have been a Miltonian reference linked originally to some unknown Miltonian pattern within the DW missions matrix / narrative.

FD has hinted that ‘environmental storytelling’ exists in game. These like the Trinkets are I believe at most, examples or archaeological information, ironically which we’ve been ignorant of for years.

Again if true it could give us a basic template to rule out certain systems, given my assessment that Raxxla is likely ‘upon the outer rim’ of the zone of Chaos, in a North Westerly local around Shamash or thereabouts.
