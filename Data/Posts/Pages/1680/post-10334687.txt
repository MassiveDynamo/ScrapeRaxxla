This pattern is supposed to represent a garden layout with pools of water, so IMHO the colour blue is likely meaningless.

I believe you are both correct, in as much it looks like they are meant to represent pools of water, with blue/green tilling/paving at the bottom.

Looking at the gardens in game, the blue/green texture moves in one direction (different in each 'pool') with a speckled white texture pattern overlaid on it, moving in a different direction to the blue/green.

Why is the water moving? No idea, I'm sure we can think up lots of lore/in world physics/in engine physics/creative reasons for that, but I'm going with 'a quick visual shorthand using as few gpu/cpu/memopry resources as possible'
