Ive long thought that the later garden designs might have been introduced to obfuscate the earlier one that might be an actual clue!

I'm starting to think the opposite - if the current Garden designs date from 2016 and the interview where MB says, in regards to Raxxla - 'no clues, but you have to make something a tiny bit obvious' is also 2016, could the current Gardens be the 'something a tiny bit obvious'?

The only thing that gives me pause is that, as far as I can tell, the Codex was introduced in December 2018.
