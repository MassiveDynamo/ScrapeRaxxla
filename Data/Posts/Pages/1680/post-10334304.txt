Been searching around places to find archival screenshots of these Tourist garden stations. I found a post on 3 April 2015 with some decent shots of the gardens.
Leonard Nimoy Station and the Imgur gallery linked there.
System: LHS 3006 -> Vulcan
Station type: Orbis
As you can see these are simpler designs - more 'plaza-like' and not overly symbolic.

Commenters around that time period also mention garden stations:
M.Gorbachev, Abe Lincoln, Li Qing Jao Stations - Sol
Galileo Station - Sol
Mars High - Sol
Gareth Edwards Park / Vonarburg Co-operative Station / Bokeili Station - Wyrd (whichever the "main station" there is)
Benlivia Station - Futhorc
Barker's Horizon Station - Futhark
Irkutsk Station - Alioth

[[Music Warning]] - timestamped video shows the full interior of M.Gorbachev Station at Earth. Video was posted 22 December 2014.

These 'palm tree' type garden stations like MGorbachev have definitely been covered over in more recent iterations.

SPOILER: EXAMPLE FROM 2020

Could this indicate FDev steering us to specific tourist stations, so players don't get sidetracked with these plainer wealthy stations. The systemic nature of their spawn conditions in the game - system type, population, economy etc, points to their locations being irrelevant to any "mystery" they may be pointing to. This would narrow it down to the Milton garden being a more generic clue.

Six station interior types for Coriolis, Ocellus, and Orbis stations are:
Standard / Industrial,
Wealthy / Service, - formerly a garden type with simple lawn + lake designs
Tourism, - the Milton garden type
Refinery / Extraction,
High Tech, and
Agriculture.
