I really wish folks (not you) wouldn't attack me for just making a personal observation and suggestion. I simply said when I look at this garder "I see..." I never said anything was a hard fact - sheesh. If people get attacked for trying to throw out some ideas then no ones going to want to share.

I'm not seeing anyone attack you in this thread - I do curate a pretty robust ignore list on here though, so they could be hidden from me!

If you're taling about @Jorki Rasalas 's and @Rochester 's discussion following your posting your garden interpretation, it reads to me like they're asking where you derived your interpretation, and robustly discussing the relative merits of the general relevance (or otherwise) of looking for hidden meaning in the Garden layout in general.

As for the Miltonian angle, honestly all of that goes over my head. I have a basic - like Wikipedia Summary basic - knowledge of the subject, and sometimes feel I should rectify that by learning more.

But I'm also basically lazy, so I default to remaining ignorant on the matter, and kidding myself my blind fumblings might help by providing a 'control check' for those better informed on such matters
