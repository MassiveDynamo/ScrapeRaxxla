He was talking about what existed at the time, so he had already provided some "clues"!

I think the Codex was "later clues" since the "Raxxla storyline in-game " had been mauled/removed

Quote from @Calaban 2Dec2015 "
Back in Beta (when we were all trapped in the "beta bubble"), the only station like that was the one in Wyrd. I think everybody had a little "oh WOW" moment the first time we whooshed through the entry port. The trees, the industrial areas converted into domed parks and gardens.
Its nice to see newer players still being surprised/amazed by it.
If you have the Sol system Permit, there are several in Sol- Gorbachev, Galileo, Mars High
