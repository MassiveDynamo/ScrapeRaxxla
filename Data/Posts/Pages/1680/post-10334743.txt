I'm not seeing anyone attack you in this thread - I do curate a pretty robust ignore list on here though, so they could be hidden from me!

If you're taling about @Jorki Rasalas 's and @Rochester 's discussion following your posting your garden interpretation, it reads to me like they're asking where you derived your interpretation, and robustly discussing the relative merits of the general relevance (or otherwise) of looking for hidden meaning in the Garden layout in general.

As for the Miltonian angle, honestly all of that goes over my head. I have a basic - like Wikipedia Summary basic - knowledge of the subject, and sometimes feel I should rectify that by learning more.

But I'm also basically lazy, so I default to remaining ignorant on the matter, and kidding myself my blind fumblings might help by providing a 'control check' for those better informed on such matters

Its usually not so much what a person says in the facts and matters, but how they say it, or they nature in the way they express it that is disparaging.

Yeah, I'm all done. I will never post here again. Too bad because I am in fact one of the very top commanders in this entire game's history by accomplishment and have a lot of things I've never revealed about the Dark Wheel that I know. It's sensitive matter and I would never just share it with anybody. These forums clearly are not that place for me.

Ill leave with this advice (that no one cares for). Do not hunt only for Raxxla, you have to unravel the mystery of the Dark Wheel first.
