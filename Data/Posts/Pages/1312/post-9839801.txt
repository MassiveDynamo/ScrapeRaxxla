Yup - noted, I wasn’t aiming for accuracy just referencing the general linkage between the alchemist metals to astrological bodies.

Again this is only one of many possible links, we are attributing the symbol directly from its alchemist history, the symbol is still generally regarded as meaning Sol generally, to focus on base metals alone may well paint us into another corner, much like focusing upon John Milton and his spheres.

All may be relevant, but likewise they all may not. If we attribute a great deal to MB we still haven’t thought of his other influences such as HP Lovecraft and Norse myth. We also may not be looking at other influences such as DB or Allen Stroud.

Again it may not actually mean anything, but they collectively may allow us to understanding the ‘language’ used when creating/seeding Raxxla, does it mean anything directly?

Or is this just poetic license. It could equally mean nothing, or everything… we just need more evidence.

At most I do believe Sol to be of significance, either Raxxla is in the Sol system or more likely very close to it.
