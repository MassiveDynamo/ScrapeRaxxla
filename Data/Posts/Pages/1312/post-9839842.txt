Yup - noted, I wasn’t aiming for accuracy just referencing the general linkage between the alchemist metals to astrological bodies.

Again this is only one of many possible links, we are attributing the symbol directly from its alchemist history, the symbol is still generally regarded as meaning Sol generally, to focus on base metals alone may well paint us into another corner, much like focusing upon John Milton and his spheres.

All may be relevant, but likewise they all may not. If we attribute a great deal to MB we still haven’t thought of his other influences such as HP Lovecraft and Norse myth. We also may not be looking at other influences such as DB or Allen Stroud.

Again it may not actually mean anything, but they collectively may allow us to understanding the ‘language’ used when creating/seeding Raxxla, does it mean anything directly?

Or is this just poetic license. It could equally mean nothing, or everything… we just need more evidence.

At most I do believe Sol to be of significance, either Raxxla is in the Sol system or more likely very close to it.

Re Sol- Gaia (Sol faction) could certainly be the Mother of Galaxies. It may be worth noting that Saturn is sometimes called the ”Crown Jewel of the Solar System” because its ring system looks like a crown (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moons_of_Saturn). I tried to make sense of the Whisperer and Siren in this context but so far failed, however Saturn IRL has a moon named Pandora, which might match the grief & woe line.

And has anyone at FD ever said why Mimas is missing from Saturn’s moons? Herschel discovered both Mimas (missing from game) and Enceladus (in game) back in 1789.
