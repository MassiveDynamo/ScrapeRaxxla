However neither hexagons nor Metatron exist within John Milton’ Paradise Lost, this is pure pareidolia. Is it related who knows, likely not, but MB was brought up catholic.

With enough insight the arrangements of the crumbs of a Bourbon biscuit could be interpreted as a message from another dimension…doesn’t necessarily mean it’s true.

Although it could just represent a station, or a hidden station.
