Well the moon is just not land-able, whereas Triton is permit locked., even though the moons TB says it's off limits .

There's a basic problem for FD with the moon - from space it looks like the moon, but you cant have a fully mapped body on the ground, so landing there would be problematic for the game engine. Therefore handwavium is employed in the TB and the moon is not a land-able type in game. Pity really..
I'm sorry, I didn't quite understand about the Moon. I remember in Frontier you could land in seven Earth cities.
And the Moon and Triton remind me of artifacts from Clarke's Odyssey.
