I was watching oak island. Isn't the dot and circle the alchemical symbol for gold? I think this has been covered, but maybe you have to be able to use a triple partial circle symbol(is that combat target or a specific ship function?) and target gold. That fits the being in a belt theory. Not sure what the rest of the symbol could mean.

I think I looked a long time ago, but doesn't something have that three part partial circle symbol. I think one obvious one is upside down compared to the image. I'm not sure if an corrected oriented one exists.

there is one. What type of weapon/ship tool is that triple circle. I don't think that is exact, but that might be showing us a type of tool to scan a gold roid with to find something.
Here is another one:

BTW, does that reticle match any from previous games?

Maybe raxxla is just an invisible meteor ring base centered in a region of gold.

Why do so many people think that the Raxxla emblem has something to do with finding her?
I wrote about it a long time ago in this thread.
To me it is a schematic drawing of a map of the galaxy. And just from this I discovered that the points on the emblem are coordinates on the map itself.
This has already been discussed in this thread.
