However neither hexagons nor Metatron exist within John Milton’ Paradise Lost, this is pure pareidolia. Is it related who knows, likely not, but MB was brought up catholic.

With enough insight the arrangements of the crumbs of a Bourbon biscuit could be interpreted as a message from another dimension…doesn’t necessarily mean it’s true.

Howdy Metatron!
Nice set of pinions there!
But what have you done with Rochester?

Now that’s blatantly wrong! Everyone knows digestives are the seer’s preference, plain or milk chocolate are ok
But beware the other variety,
for that is the way to the Dark Side!
