FD have obviously seeded the ED game with content within or around the bubble. Early statements by FD iterate that they planned for space travel to be far more difficult, so for instance getting to Sag A would have been very time consuming and by their own attribution rather dull, so they are very likely to have seeded Raxxla somewhere near the bubble.
"...so they are very likely to have seeded Raxxla somewhere near the bubble." - It makes sense. moreover, the codex states that it is possible that some dictator or organization already controls it for their own purposes (aka a minor faction)*. We can only find a dictator or an organization in an inhabited place. At the time of release in the Pleiades and Delphi and other things were not yet. Only the bubble remains.

* possibly in the English localization, a sinister group or a lone tyrant is mentioned
