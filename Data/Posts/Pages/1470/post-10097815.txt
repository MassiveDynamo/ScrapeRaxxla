I know the Independent Raxxla Hunters discord has details on the landscape signal as it was called. I can see if I find a synopsis of findings. Of note, there is weirdly shaped region to the right of Sagr A* with rumors of Guardian sites in that area. Probably wouldn't hurt to map which regions have globular clusters present.
The question here is not about Guardien, they appeared in the game much later. judging by the interview, Raxxla was from the release. After the release, we didn't have such long jumps as we do now, and getting to the center of the Galaxy was another story that can be compared to aphids to suicide, or to heroism. And perhaps there was (or is) some kind of game mechanics that allows you to solve this issue or easter egg

If there is any information about the signal - I will be grateful. We already sorted it out somehow, but did not find a solution
