By the way, the S-0x designations appear to be on all orbital stations, outposts, fleet carriers, and surface ports in the lower docking area (written on the walls). Possibly linked via Sagr A Cluster of stars ( see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*_cluster ). Noteworthy, in "Alien World: A Complete Illustrated Guide" globular clusters are specifically mentioned in reference to Talmor Lens (but nothing has been established in-game). This may partly be due to a long-time hesitancy to include some of the other books written by Holdstock alluding to the Raxxla myth.

My only contributions on this were linking the S-x designation to something possibly near the core and finding stars with similar designations.



* - Unsure if this hints at an alignment of key structures towards the core of the galaxy.
