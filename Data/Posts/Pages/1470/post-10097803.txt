In theory with asteroids in Sol, the interview confuses me, when .. I don’t remember now, but there was information that someone had already flown through the system with Raxxla, pilot simply didn’t notice. In the Sol system, a huge number of players fly by, not just one

But here's what I wanted to clarify, maybe someone remembers how long ago we discovered singing when you aim at the center of the galaxy? was it a signal from the very release of the game? Are these the same sirens from the codex?

If in the Raxxla emblem the circle with a dot really means Sol, which, as it were, means the starting point, then we turn to the call of the Sirens, and something may be on the way to the center of the galaxy (if my map is correct, then Sol is very conveniently located on the boundary line between the sectors and the direction the path is more or less clear)
