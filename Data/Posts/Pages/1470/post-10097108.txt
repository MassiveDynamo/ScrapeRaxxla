Woe and grief upon a highway to hell

Just re-read Paradise Lost in relation to a passage that touches upon ‘asphodels’; the flowers which carpeted Homers Hades (and in game close to Pandemonium).

@Han_Zen @Emperor this all links back…

In it there is a passage on Sinne and Death, and I just felt (and I know others have touched on this too); that maybe the passage in the Codex reads: Lovers woe = Sin, and Parents grief = bereavement ergo Death.

Paradise Lost: Book 9 (1674 version)
Terrestrial Heav'n, danc't round by other Heav'ns That shine, yet bear thir bright officious Lamps, Light above Light, for thee alone, as seems, In thee concentring all thir precious beams Of sacred influence: As God in Heav'n Is Center, yet extends to all, so thou Centring receav'st from all those…

But what could that mean, well Sin and Death were the offspring of Lucifer in Paradise Lost, and resided in Hell / Underworld, and guarded hells gate, and built the great viaduct, out of hell to the crystalline sphere…where Lucifer ‘wandered’…

All have been discussed previously, I just wondered, if we take them literally as a literary reference, not just points in space; in relation to the potential hint of Cora being Kore / Persephone, then together it all just might refer to: take a journey to hell.

Where it takes us from there, is anyone’s guess but I feel it’s directing us to a specific area, in the underworld set out in game, I no longer believe it’s coincidence, there are too many correlations, plus it fits with the ‘on the outer rim’ theory, as this area is on the outer rim of a sphere of influence, set by the date 2296…does the journey start on the highway to hell.

Currently, on route to Persephone to nvestigate this underworld for any additional clues, it always looked too obvious…maybe it is?
