So, you're saying they were overly ambitious and did it bit by bit. Though, in a way that doesn't exactly preclude the possibility that as game engine and assets were improved and increased Raxxla was modified to be closer to the ideal version that was planned. That said Omphalos Rift may not have changed but I always assumed the Omphalos Rift had some way connected to surface infrastructure.
Jepp. Everything has been done bit by bit. The ten year plan.
