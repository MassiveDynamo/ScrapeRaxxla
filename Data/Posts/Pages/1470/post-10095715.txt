As much as I like this sentiment about asteroid bases, we have to remember that they also exist in all far flung nebulae.

For this hypothesis to have relevance, we need evidence from inside ED to support such exterior historical lore. Remember Stroud, if it’s not in game currently, it’s not really canon.

The far flung nebula stations were effectively implemented to assist exploration, if I recall correctly. FD has a habit of ignoring logic, I think it’s safe to assume they haven’t considered any lore application, many of these stations may just be recent occurrences.

One element I miss from early development proposals was Braben’s idea of inflatable stations, where a Cmdr with a big ship could transport a pre-fab fusion device to an asteroid, and let it melt itself to the core, then heat it like a glass blower and then inflate the centre to build a station… so technically such quick stations are possible… sadly such a mechanism has been lost to the purge, I doubt we will ever see them albeit in maybe some rudimentary poor application maybe...

However they should not be discounted, it’s possible they might identify something, but what?
