Just some winking cat thoughts….

Rackham was pointed out to be Calico Jack a reference to an old pirate. Pirates tend to have eye patches (wink). And Calico is also a type of cat (maybe we've never been shown the winking cat logo for a reason). The tying in with card games also makes me think of One-Eyed Jacks… someone who has two sides to their personality. And lets face it .. for an ex pirate .. turning into an art thief isnt much of a change.
