Milky ...is because it is Milk of Hera (Hecate) spit when she pushed out Heracle. So ...we have a system

But I don't see fancy names on EDSM. Need to visit for installations though.

Surprisingly, I checked my galmap, Ive already been to and scanned that system, no instalations besides the two starports listed on EDSM
