That makes a lot of sense to me. I didn't have a clue what Cassiopea was.
I only have a Worn Texan hat being an ED Nomad of sorts (since Horizons) just etching a living wherever I lay my landing gear and not an explorer as such.
On another note, does "The Holdstock Report" hold any water?
Bit's in there about the Guardians also mention OISIR-RAXXLA or more specifically the phrase "Raxxlan robotics" indicating it is or was an actual place, or is this totally unrelated.

-_-" No idea, to be honest, but im going too look into it, thats for sure, lmao
