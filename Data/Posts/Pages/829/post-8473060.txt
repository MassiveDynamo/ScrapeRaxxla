My best opinion on the Mother of galaxies, would actually be the center of our entire Universe, the place wher "the big bang" happend. But I cant apply that location into the game or the poem
There is no center of universe because big bang happened everywhere simultaneously. It's just space-time expanding. Think of it like changing the scale of units of space.

In the relation between Sag A* and the stars of the Milkiway I cannot find an analogy to being a mother. What Sag A* does to a star coming to close is to rip it into pieces and suck it in. Not quite like giving birth...
On contrary, when sup mas black hole eats mass it also generates around self so much energy, that it creates galactic waves of matter thickness with creates new stars en masse. You should read about that. Of course super energetic quasars make so much energy that it can push gas just away and stop star creation.
Also interesting about galactic spirals:
