I had recently been back to NGC 7822 just because how pretty it is and still close enough to the bubble to not miss any of my bgs work. Anyways, after looking at some of my pictures i realized, from the right perspective it could be something written in Braille. I wasnt there when i though this so i didnt get to look from all angle, just a thought.

Idk if braille is the same universally or not but if it is it would be a good way to include all languages

Any pickies??
