I have been lurking more than contributing as my local shop has not had any tin foil recently (panic buyers and all) but I have not seen any debunking from a certain psychotic penguin. Anyone know if he is still hunting/parallaxing?

Not appeared here for a long time. Did find one of his posts not so long ago on a thread when I was doing a forum search. Perhaps he was inducted into TDW and cant talk any more to the tinfoil brigade!
