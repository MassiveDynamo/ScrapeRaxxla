To the whisperer in witchspace
I always thought it is NS. If you target it by FSS scanner it will whisper like ghost. Also it is related to WS as it boosts fsd.
To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies!
Lately I have 2 options - W-R star as it can do spirals OR/AND HOT NS like Jameson Lighthouse. Those NS has over 3Sols Mass which is impossible and billion degree near. Also it has special picture in witch space - it is huge shiny thing.
