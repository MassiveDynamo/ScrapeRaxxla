2. To the whisperer in witchspace,
Some Thargoid system? Maybe Polaris(That was the locked one right?)

3. the siren of the deepest void!
The sister Systems? Pleiades? There where Tharogoid things too right? Is there a black hole maybe?

4. The parent's grief,
I have no clue, maybe also some greek mythology stuff?

5. the lover's woe,
Also - no clue what it could be to be fair.

Could mean the Dark Wheel System? Or maybe Raxxla itself?
