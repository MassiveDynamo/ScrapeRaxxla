Am I right in thinking the clue to the "mother of all galaxies" isn't cassiopeia? Andromeda is a constellation as well as a galaxy? Her constellation is found near cassiopeia. Is our galaxy named after the same person? Sorry if this is a really stupid question, I don't know much or can grasp astronomy to well.
I believe, in mythology, Cassiopeia was the mother of Andromeda
