AND BTW, thanks for the link, i finally got 5 min to sit down and use it, edit it with my coordinates, but THANKS, huge help, now I can triagulate from any 3 systems I want, I've got a few I wanted to try, but its been so long I gotta look em all up again, lol

But thanks, I got a different result for centroid using your code than the picture I was given, so im going to check out about 20 or so systems around each one... they are not far far from each other, but slightly off...
check main at bottom, code can do 2 different calculations - "center of inner circle" and "mass center" which are different points. mass center is commented out by // there. Remove that sign to have that link too.
