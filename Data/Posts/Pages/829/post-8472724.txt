That makes a lot of sense to me. I didn't have a clue what Cassiopea was.
I only have a Worn Texan hat being an ED Nomad of sorts (since Horizons) just etching a living wherever I lay my landing gear and not an explorer as such.
On another note, does "The Holdstock Report" hold any water?
Bit's in there about the Guardians also mention OISIR-RAXXLA or more specifically the phrase "Raxxlan robotics" indicating it is or was an actual place, or is this totally unrelated.

Robert Holdstock wrote The Dark Wheel novella that accompanied the first Elite game back in 1980s. He also wrote other scifi under other noms de plume and OISIR-RAXXLA was an alien race in one of those books. Hence he was the first to coin the word RAXXLA and wrote it into the Elite novella. Raxxla has been, for the first time, implemented in-game for Elite Dangerous. We have it on good authority that itâ€™s in the Milky Way, but we dont know what it is.
