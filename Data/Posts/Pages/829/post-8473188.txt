There is no center of universe because big bang happened everywhere simultaneously. It's just space-time expanding. Think of it like changing the scale of units of space.

On contrary, when sup mas black hole eats mass it also generates around self so much energy, that it creates galactic waves of matter thickness with creates new stars en masse. You should read about that. Of course super energetic quasars make so much energy that it can push gas just away and stop star creation.
Also interesting about galactic spirals:

The Milky Way has satellite galaxies, the Local Group which includes the two Magellanic Clouds plus some others. Hence Sag A* could legitimately be viewed as the mother of galaxies.
