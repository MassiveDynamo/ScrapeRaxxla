AND BTW, thanks for the link, i finally got 5 min to sit down and use it, edit it with my coordinates, but THANKS, huge help, now I can triagulate from any 3 systems I want, I've got a few I wanted to try, but its been so long I gotta look em all up again, lol

But thanks, I got a different result for centroid using your code than the picture I was given, so im going to check out about 20 or so systems around each one... they are not far far from each other, but slightly off...
Or maybe 6 systems.
1. To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies!
2. To the whisperer in witchspace,
3. the siren of the deepest void!
4. The parent's grief,
5. the lover's woe,
6. and the yearning of our vagabond hearts.
...
To Raxxla!
