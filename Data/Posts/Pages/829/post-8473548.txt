Yes, Cetus’ Bane is still in-game (Algol, one planet is surprisingly 100% metal. I thought it might be one of the Guardian Ark ships but could find no evidence); I posted on it just last week.

Cetus’ Bane is a reference to Perseus who killed Poseidon’s sea monster Cetus (turned it to stone using Medusa’s severed head) to save Andromeda, who was chained to a rock as a sacrifice to Cetus in order to appease Poseidon. Andromeda’s arrogant and vain mother Queen Cassiopeia had claimed she and her daughter were more beautiful than all the Nereids, the daughters of the sea god Nereus. This brought the wrath of Poseidon, ruling god of the sea.
Poseidon is Neptune. Idk if that is connected.

I wonder if lover's woe could refer to Penelope, Odysseus' wife, queen of Ithaca Odysseus was an Argonaut who was lost for ten years while returning from the trojan war in The Odyssey. There were siren songs in that tale. And Poseidon/neptune.

I think we chased this rabbit before or we might still be lost in its hole...
