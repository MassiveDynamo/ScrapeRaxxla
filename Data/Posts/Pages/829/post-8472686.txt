Oh sorry, I could have worded it better. Thinking about it for a while, I should have said something like..

Sag A* being the super massive black hole at the centre of our milky way Galaxy and everything in the Milky Way orbits around it is (metaforically speaking) akin to something like a mother would do to keep to watch over her children (stars), Much like what every other Galaxy that has a super massive black hole at their centres are doing.

If anyone could word it any better then please do.
Just a discussion and I also could have described better why I do not think that SagA* is this "mother of galaxies" (just my opinion): For me the mother of a galaxy should somehow be the reason why the galaxy exists. And about SagA* I think its part of the galaxy. Surely SagA* is the most heavy end extreme part – but still a part of the galaxy. And that's why I do not believe that SagA* will help us here…
Anyway, I have somewhat run out of ideas about the whole Raxxla thing and a theory that can be discussed is something I appreciate, even if I don't agree.
