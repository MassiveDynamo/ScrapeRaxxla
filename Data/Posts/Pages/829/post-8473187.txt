On parents' grief and constellations i got this excerpt from a wiki

The constellation is said to have astrological influences as well. It is said that any man born at the same time Andromeda is said to rise from the sea will be one without mercy; he will be emotionally unmoved even in the presence of grieving parents.

Another reference to Andromeda and Cassiopeia by proxy.

Some will have been around for the medusa cobra thing that happened in game, im not sure if its still doable or not but in the end you're led to a cobra 3 npc with a medusa skin named Cetus Bane. Cetus was the name of a sea monster Poseidon created to punish the world for Cassiopeia's claims of being more beautiful than the gods.


Edit: completely unrelated to this but I've recently decided that I think Felicia Winters and A Lavigny-Duvall are clones. Have fun

Yes, Cetus’ Bane is still in-game (Algol, one planet is surprisingly 100% metal. I thought it might be one of the Guardian Ark ships but could find no evidence); I posted on it just last week.

Cetus’ Bane is a reference to Perseus who killed Poseidon’s sea monster Cetus (turned it to stone using Medusa’s severed head) to save Andromeda, who was chained to a rock as a sacrifice to Cetus in order to appease Poseidon. Andromeda’s arrogant and vain mother Queen Cassiopeia had claimed she and her daughter were more beautiful than all the Nereids, the daughters of the sea god Nereus. This brought the wrath of Poseidon, ruling god of the sea.
