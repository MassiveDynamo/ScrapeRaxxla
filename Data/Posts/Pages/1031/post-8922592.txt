Encountered the green glow twice today in Sol. The first was extremely strong (bright) and the second was very dim. Recorded both, will upload later today or tomorrow.

Edit: Because @Merlin StWahgwaan brought it up, I also noted that this glow only appears after exiting the system map. It dampens my expectations a bit, since that seemed to be a recurring theme in @Jorki Rasalas' videos as well. If the system map is a common trigger it's most likely a bug.
I feel like given the nature of the location being just a place in open deep space it would be otherwise impossible to find without opening the system map multiple times to check your location relative to where the belt should be. Also I feel like if that was the case you could repeat it every time just by opening and closing the system map
