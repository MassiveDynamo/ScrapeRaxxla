Is the green light observable in different parts of the belt or only in one place?

I’ve flown around the belt many times-I initially started this in order to explore the asteroid cluster notification in the hud left holographic display that Koben (I think, apologies if it’s someone else!) mentioned. The only place I’ve encountered this green glow is in sector 16.
