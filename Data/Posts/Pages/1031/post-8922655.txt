Doesn't look like a graphical glitch to me.

My guess: The light is actually far away; it's a spot/cone light with a very small opening angle.

The reason is that the lighting angle within the cockpit does not change, only the intensity changes.

I disagree. The lighting angle does, to me, seem to change a little between the examples in the videos I managed to get. But I think I am triggering whatever it is and passing beyond it before it reaches full brightness.
