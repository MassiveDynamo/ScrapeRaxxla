So, your video shows you were around the same position (~1500 ls from Sol) that I had my vivid encounter. Must compare video but in yours the light source seems to me to be coming from below your ship in the direction of the Magellanic Clouds ( it’s very difficult to keep track of the ship orientation!). I think that’s the same ship orientation as my video. The first example I had (weak glow) the direction seemed to come (if I remember correctly) from slightly astern, above and right & I was at ~1328 ls from Sol with Sol on the left and just slightly above the plane of Jupiter, which I think is there below the plane of the asteroid belt as shown on the sysmap. So the light source seems to me to be “South” of Sol, in sector 16 (or 15, need to recheck the videos and my counting) and within the plane of the asteroid belt. Need to recheck all this tomorrow, I’m tired!

Did any of your chums spot it when you did? Is it a phenomenon that can be observed simultaneously by several pilots (e.g. in a Wing) ->perhaps a light cone from a real source, or only one at a time->perhaps laser beam or lighting bug?? Does everybody see it when at the same location?

Keeping track of orientation is a real pain! Some of the guys I was working with in Independent Raxxla Hunters (btw you should get on their discord, we have an investigation going) talked about it coming from above their ships, but then again orientation is hard to track, it could be the same direction as you and me.

We did suggest hunting in a wing but at the time it was 2am and I needed to go to bed.

Really yea, check out their discord as there's more than just my observations available to go on and we can share info easier. If I get a chance I'll link as much of our findings as I can here.
