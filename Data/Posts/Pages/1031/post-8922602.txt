I feel like given the nature of the location being just a place in open deep space it would be otherwise impossible to find without opening the system map multiple times to check your location relative to where the belt should be. Also I feel like if that was the case you could repeat it every time just by opening and closing the system map
thats also a good point i hadnt considered... since there is no live on screen like system coordinates, that would be basically the only way to know for sure if your in the right area i guess.... hmmmmm...... very interesting.....
