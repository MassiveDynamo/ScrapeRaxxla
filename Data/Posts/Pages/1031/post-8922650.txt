I have a few ideas on how to search for this a bit better in SOL, I just wish I wasnt litterally like exactly 50% of the way out to Sag A* ...... and also not on my xbox, lol, since most of my plan would be 10000x better with atleast 2 ppl working together, the more the better though....

If anyone has a group of atleast 2 ppl who want to try to give this a 'brute force' search (in game, not data mining, just to be clear), here is my best idea so far.....

SPOILER: SPOLIER




































Again, not saying it would be easy or fast, ,but an idea of how to do it that would align with some previous quotes and information about it being eaiser with more players ect.....
