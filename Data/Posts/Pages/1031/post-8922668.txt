I did not get a look unfortunately

I tried for a couple of hours last night and that was the only time I got it. Others in the Independent Raxxla Hunters were able to get it more consistently and start making guesses on locations. Interestingly they were getting it outside of the so called Sector 16 and slightly above the belt too, they tended towards the "North East" area, or 0-~75° clockwise.

So, your video shows you were around the same position (~1500 ls from Sol) that I had my vivid encounter. Must compare video but in yours the light source seems to me to be coming from below your ship in the direction of the Magellanic Clouds ( it’s very difficult to keep track of the ship orientation!). I think that’s the same ship orientation as my video. The first example I had (weak glow) the direction seemed to come (if I remember correctly) from slightly astern, above and right & I was at ~1328 ls from Sol with Sol on the left and just slightly above the plane of Jupiter, which I think is there below the plane of the asteroid belt as shown on the sysmap. So the light source seems to me to be “South” of Sol, in sector 16 (or 15, need to recheck the videos and my counting) and within the plane of the asteroid belt. Need to recheck all this tomorrow, I’m tired!

Did any of your chums spot it when you did? Is it a phenomenon that can be observed simultaneously by several pilots (e.g. in a Wing) ->perhaps a light cone from a real source, or only one at a time->perhaps laser beam or lighting bug?? Does everybody see it when at the same location?
