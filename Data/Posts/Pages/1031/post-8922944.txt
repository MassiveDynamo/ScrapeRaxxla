Posting this from my phone so I won't be able to elaborate or directly quote other messages.

In the video I'll (hopefully) be posting tonight you'll see that orientation didn't matter much in my encounter. In fact, I was facing the sun and my ship was outside of the asteroid belt, so if the glow is coming from another system I would be curious to see how my alignment compares with Jorki's. I was also in a completely different region, somewhere around sector 30.

I had also considered the possibility that the green color matches earth-like orbit lines and to some extent the grid. I doubt either of these would trigger a visual bug, but stranger things have happened. In my opinion the strongest evidence for this being a bug is how the light saturates brightly lit portions of the ship and doesn't respond to movement like we would expect to see (such as in starlight).

Finding the direction this is coming from, or verifying if it's even visible from multiple cockpits would almost surely put a huge dent in the bug claim. I suggest a few wings fly around the system for a couple of hours with a navigator at the lead focused on keeping them oriented. At this point the information would be extremely helpful.
