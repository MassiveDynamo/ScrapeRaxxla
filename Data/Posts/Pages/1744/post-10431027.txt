which anyone could stumble across accidentally, but of course knowing what would trigger a misjump is itself a really broad question even if the rest of the theory was right.
It could involve precise timing with the high-wake loading bar, like boosting just before or turning the ship power off...
It sounds silly, but worth trying (what isn't worth trying anyway, eh?).
Maybe the ships have hidden features.
Or... "Observers speculated that Thargoid Sensor interference could be to blame for the mis-jump." [Jacques Station]
Should we carry one ??
