They are, they can be obtained still. FD did not scrub them for some unknown reason. It is an unknown if they have any function.

Also: any idea why for some odd reason i can't MULTI-quote anymore in this thread? Only seems to be occurring on this page 1744 though . Anyone else notice this too? ( obviously i just multi-quoted from replies on page 1743 ^ , so it's weird how the forums are acting differently now for page 1744 -- And i'm able to multi-quote on ALL other forum threads & sections & pages. Just not this page 1744 for some strange reason. )
