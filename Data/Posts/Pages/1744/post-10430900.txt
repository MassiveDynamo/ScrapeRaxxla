I'm quite willing to believe that the landscape signal has nothing to do with Raxxla and is merely intended to be "the sound of the galactic core";
I don't believe it. Fdev closed the ticket as "work as expected" so the sound is correctly positioned. I understand the game can be quite faulty at times but we shouldn't assume it's a technical issue, unless provable (and yes, that requires understanding HOW the considered feature works), at the risk of missing something.

We may NOT like it, because it throws into the bin tons of complex theories elaborated over several years but the position of the signal fits the bill for Raxxla :
On the brow of (an instance of) the (remains of) mothers of galaxies
Spiralling stars
For those with "eyes" to see (meaning, senses to perceive as ears to hear would have been such a giveaway).
Sirens of the deepest void
It's a tiny bit obvious, but not more than necessary
Everyone has to do the travel for themselves.

If that's correct then TDW found the signal, but whether they succeeded in reaching it remains to be seen.
A way in is plausible, the door that is also the key hasn't been found yet.
