I think the problem with Raxxla itself being in the bubble is that it then needs a really good explanation for "why has no-one - including centuries of NPCs! - accidentally found it by now?"
I look at this like Hutton, if that was not marked, no one would have found that by now either.

Excluding following NPC's but I doubt they have the programming for TDW or Raxxla.
