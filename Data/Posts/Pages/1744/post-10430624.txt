With all the megaships moving to ShinDez neighbour V886 Centauri, I thought of an old observation made by Corr: that star was nicknamed "Lucy" because, as a white dwarf under crystallization, it's effectively a colossal diamond.

So the jewel on the brow could be a white dwarf... or a carbon planet (e.g. 55 Cancri e, named Rho Cancri I ingame).
