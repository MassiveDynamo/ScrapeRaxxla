That triangle of reference points is pretty much a isosceles, Is there any view point that might mean the red dot aligns with the middle. or even the apex?


I dont have the tools or knowledge to make those models , but the other systems mentioned by IRH are as follows,

JUENAE AC-B D1-10264
JUENAE PS-L A7-41
JUENAE AJ-C C2-1768
JUENAE ZI-C C2-3115
STUEMEAE GG-Y C4801

If you add those in, you could argue that from a certain view point they would make a polygon or a pentagon in the centre?

Then tbh, your not to far from finding a 6th, that when looked at from the correct angle forms a hexagon.. and while i agree you can make that anywhere, something that was around this signal in that shape would hold far more worth. Especially if the source was centred. (stretching ideas now i know, but hey you asked for a possible direction )

Worth trying. I'm right there (have been for about a year now) so I'll try this and report back.
