I think the problem with Raxxla itself being in the bubble is that it then needs a really good explanation for "why has no-one - including centuries of NPCs! - accidentally found it by now?" that would nevertheless allow someone who knew what they were doing to track it down fairly easily - whereas even a few hundred LY out in a non-descript system the level of concealment required to ensure no-one accidentally stumbles across it is so much lower.

I don't buy the "there was a reference to it in 2296 so someone must have got there by then" line of argument; the earliest known references to both the existence of the Moon and attempts to reach it long predate 1969.

I don't believe it. Fdev closed the ticket as "work as expected" so the sound is correctly positioned.
"Correctly positioned" doesn't mean "has anything to do with Raxxla", was my point. If it turns out to be unrelated there are other reasons Frontier might have put a sound in deep space.

I do like the theory that it has something to do with Raxxla, incidentally - it fits fairly well with a lot of the Codex, and I went out earlier this year to try some experiments on reaching the source (without success, naturally) - but there remains the possibility for non-Raxxla explanations which don't require its position to be a bug.
