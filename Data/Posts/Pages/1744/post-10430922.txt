I as much as anyone appreciate the work done on the landscape signal concept but…with respect.

I find the logistics of separation between this evident element and locations indicated in the codex, to be too distant!

Such a separation in key information makes no sense.

In the codex there is an evident locational clue in respect of Tau Ceti; there is also a temporal clue in respect of 2296!

In the codex the reference to Cora comes home drunk, is likely a reference to the myth of Demeter and Persephone!

In the codex there reference to Atlantis and the Cities of Gold is likely a reference to the ‘Lost Realms’ zone!

Again the various allusions in the text conspire there to be a link to MB’s Legacy, based in Artemis, as does the Brookes Tours, which equally pass through that zone!

It’s evident then the codex is telling us to focus efforts in the bubble, if this were not the case why provide such information if it concerns a signal at the centre of the galaxy, which can be heard at any point in space?!

No - I do not believe it’s the objective.

I suspect it’s linked, or maybe an Easter egg, but such distances surely allow for too much interpretation?
