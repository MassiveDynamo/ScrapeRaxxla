ok so since i only purchased the "entire" game 5 months ago as 'Elite Dangerous: ODYSSEY' , then i'm just permanantly defaulted into that version.

Which is fine of course but then my next question is: Am i missing anything by not ever swapping into 'Horizons' or 'Legacy' version?

Like for example could i miss out on RAXXLA related content or old Dark Wheel missions/rewards, materials, & such ? And would any of that carryover into my 'Odyssey' defaulted version anyway?

ok right but so then this is why my grand "discovery" of The Dark Wheel faction system the other day wasn't anything really to get excited about at all , eh?

Sort of a bummer , but oh well. ( i still grinded to green Allied status there anyway for fun )

whoa awesome ! Like an epic Community goal/war type situation? Are there any old forum threads ( stickied ) about this historcal time in EliteD ?

One of my pilot buddies ingame ( who is a vet of this game ) told me the other day he still has one of those quest reward things. But he has zero interest in RAXXLA at all. ( he's strictly a hardcore PVP'er ) -- So now i'm wondering if they are droppable/tradeable ?
--------------------
Also, side note: i was looking again at the RAXXLA 'hexagram' symbol image ... There are 6 black polygons around the outer edges, yeah? Well, there's also 6 letters in the word R-A-X-X-L-A . And, in the middle of that image , there are 3 broken curved lines around that tiny black dot in middle. Well, 'The Dark Wheel' = 3 words . i dunno...random thought i guess. ( sorry if this was already discussed ad nauseum within this now 1700+ page thread )

The dark wheel is a group of organizations, the faction is a front to please the founders from a legal standpoint, that is to say, if they have a faction they're complying with PF rules.
