The core problem with Raxxla is understanding whatever Raxxla may be is a huge matter of debate. It helps not one bit that understanding the larger story of Elite Dangerous involves a not insignificant amount of misinformation. Some of it intentionally due to propaganda and still others unintentionally via so much changes rapidly that old mixes with new. Realistically, the only way to do is analyze everything we thought we know and see where that leaves us. Just getting this far was not easy. I just hope that if anything this gives us a framework where we can honestly start evaluating why some things got obfuscated and others didn't. Only in knowing what happened in the past, can we properly evaluate what we are told in the present and determine which path that leads down. Raxxla seems to exist so early as a rumor as to indicate that if it were found at that point, it would have had a profound impact. It would, quite frankly, be relieving if the group that found it could be located so we had some idea of what precisely we are searching for exactly.
