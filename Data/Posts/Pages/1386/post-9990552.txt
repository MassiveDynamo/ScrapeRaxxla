That’s a good start.

But we have to be mindful of Allen Stoud’s information; namely the historical information was developed separately against the current narrative.

That means there really is no definitive information on drive distances at that time. You also have to ask the question of re-fuelling opportunities.

I suspect the absence of this information is not evidence of information, but simply complacency. The lowest common denominator, but don’t give up, don’t mind me I’m in a cynical mood this morning..
