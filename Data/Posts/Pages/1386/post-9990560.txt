Yes…

In theory due to the absence of definitive data one could only apply averages.

Work out the distances between all systems discovered upto 2296. Do we know definitely what the starting points are?

Work out an average speed needed to travel to all these systems via Sol, is there a mean average, then use that to draw an area of influence around all systems discovered upto 2296, does that average fit, eg what is the average travel time based against equal lengths and shorter / longer lengths, where does that take you, what does that correlate with currently.

The theory is sound but we cannot utilise definitive data because we don’t know it so you have to assess the average. This can be useful if you keep to the math.

It could correlate to a key information gap it might not, it might expand the search area, but you need some form of correlation to back it up. Such as a later system, it’s very open to interpretation only only applicable as a method of assumption.
