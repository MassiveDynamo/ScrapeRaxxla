So would it be smart if possible to create a Sphere of influence based on year?
Say if I were to were to draw a sphere stretches from Sol to Tau Ceti. Then move the sphere at the center of Sol then I would have a possible sphere of influence of that year.

Then if I were to draw sphere of influence between Sol and Achenar and move that sphere so it is dead center of Sol I would have a possible sphere of influence of that year.
So on and so forth. So we get a hard estimate of possible travel time they made between years and match up what we can in-between?
