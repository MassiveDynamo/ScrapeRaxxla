Mmm, Ive been banging on about LAWD 26 for ages. It’s a HUGE anomaly within the game which clashes with DB’s stated love of astronomy and goal of scientific accuracy for ED.

If LAWD 26 actually contained a Wolf Rayet it would be brighter than our own sun! IIRC the nearest IRL is Gamma Velorum, of Guardian homeworld rumour, which is over 1000 ly away but is still visible to the naked eye!

And WR isnt the only possible solution to “Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars”
In regards to LAWD 26 I actually contacted FD Support regarding this very issue.

Now Support is Support, they are not Developers, so many of their responses will not have a grounding on known facts, but are practical.

I gave them a pretty solid question very similar to what @Jorki Rasalas has already prescribed. They gave me a semi long response back (I can post if required), that basically stated it sounded like a bug, and so not important enough to throw past the Dev team - best report it as a bug.

I don’t accept that as definitive truth. as we ourselves have identified that Support have limited knowledge - if you asked Support tomorrow about the DW missions they will state they are working and active, this has been proven to be false, likely because Support are not told everything.

But the process of reporting a bug - both via the bug report system and in the official forums (not here in Lore) and via the Com Dev inbox, is a viable one, which might get a FD response, if not at least increase players interest.

There are numerous astronomical bugs in game, it is not outside the realms of belief that such an anomaly can exist and is simply due to human oversight.

I say we test it by reporting it as a bug and via the Com Dev team, highlighting the scientific inaccuracies not it’s relevance to Raxxla and see what that shakes up.
