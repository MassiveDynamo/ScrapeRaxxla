The 7 ly jump range from Elite is just for one specific ship. We fly a Cobra MKIII with Calcop navigation.
There is no reason to believe that other ships didn't have different jump ranges, in the same time period.

GalCop Space Licensing Authority had more or less full control over the ships of their licensed pilots.

There are quite good descriptions of this, in the novella 'Imprint'. http://www.dream-ware.co.uk/elite/books/imprint/

This story was written in 1991. It seems that part of it's purpose was to bridge the gap between the original game and the full Galaxy that became available with FE2.
