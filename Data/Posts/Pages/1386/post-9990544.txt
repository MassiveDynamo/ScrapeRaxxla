Hopefully I'm doing this right

If you based on the start of Fall which begins between 22-24 Sept and then add the days following to 1st of Jan of next year that is around 101 total days at most give or take.

It's 117.05 ly apart between Beta Hydri and Achenar.

In a straight line (which is obviously not possible) they would need to clear an avg. of 1.16 ly a day to make it on time. But since it's impossible to fly in a straight line. They would have to clear average of 3 to 5 ly cause they are going as fast as their slowest ship. Not sure not sure if the Capital Ships existed then.

Anyone can think of a way to calculate distance and time let me know lol.
