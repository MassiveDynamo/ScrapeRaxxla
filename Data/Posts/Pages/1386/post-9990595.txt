Mmm, Ive been banging on about LAWD 26 for ages. It’s a HUGE anomaly within the game which clashes with DB’s stated love of astronomy and goal of scientific accuracy for ED.

If LAWD 26 actually contained a Wolf Rayet it would be brighter than our own sun! IIRC the nearest IRL is Gamma Velorum, of Guardian homeworld rumour, which is over 1000 ly away but is still visible to the naked eye!

And WR isnt the only possible solution to “Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars”
That's actually pretty terrifying! (star brighter than the sun) Thanks for that new existential nightmare

I'm be extremely interested in interpretations of Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars. As per my post a while back, I can't help but think it means the Thargoid starmap spiral - but I'd like that not to be the case
