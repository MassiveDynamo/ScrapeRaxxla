2097. It is stated but only indirectly (only the year is mentioned) so you have to do a bit of piecing things together. In First Encounters journals it is stated plainly, she left on the Mayflower 97 which was the first generation ship. See "Galactic News: Generation Ships".
The Mayflower 97 is probably still going full speed. At least it was in the 3250s. They reached Tau Ceti a planned, but chose to continue to travel. It would be great if it showed up in ED, at some point.
