what year was Tau Ceti become a settlement?

What year did Empire settle in their spot? This should be correct dates right?

"2151 - Following the return of an interstellar probe sent to the Tau Ceti system, the first human colony outside of Sol is established in Tau Ceti on Tau Ceti 3, where the first alien life is also discovered."

"Achenar was charted and settled in 2292 by a colonial mission led by Marlin Duval, who sought to establish an independent government outside the rigid bureacracy and social conformity of the Federation."

These dates appear in-game, and therefore we must treat them as facts unless/until there's anything that shows otherwise.

I can't find any solid information on when Duval's expedition left Earth though.

If you're attempting to calculate pre-faraway FTL speeds, I think your best option is this the Beta Hydri info that @CMDRCorrMorningstarFelian highlighted that you talked about before:

Edit: You already did that
