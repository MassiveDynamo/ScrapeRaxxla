That's interesting. When I was recently taking my 'codex only' run at Raxxla originally I actually interpreted the "Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars" as possibly a wolf-rayet, but I thought they weren't actually in the game so I discounted that entirely without checking (stupid).

Then @Thatchinho, @CMDR Davanix, and @CMDRCorrMorningstarFelian a few posts back were discussing that odd system, Lawd 26, which I also didn't know about, that's close to Sol and seems to contain:



That would be something astronomically interesting (right?) reachable within our timeframe.

Mmm, Ive been banging on about LAWD 26 for ages. It’s a HUGE anomaly within the game which clashes with DB’s stated love of astronomy and goal of scientific accuracy for ED.

If LAWD 26 actually contained a Wolf Rayet it would be brighter than our own sun! IIRC the nearest IRL is Gamma Velorum, of Guardian homeworld rumour, which is over 1000 ly away but is still visible to the naked eye!

And WR isnt the only possible solution to “Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars”
