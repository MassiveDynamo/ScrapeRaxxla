Well. My copy of Tour of the Universe by Malcolm Edwards and Robert Holdstock has arrived. Sadly there is no index but I'm still hopeful that I'll find a reference to Raxxla somewhere among the pages. I flipped it open and on the second page found a reference the the Galactic Co-Operative (GalCop). I'm increasingly losing hope that finding Raxxla in Elite: Dangerous will somehow rely on digging through Holdstock's fiction to find the path but I'm also becoming more interested in untangling the path that led Holdstock to writing The Dark Wheel then I am in actually finding Raxxla inside the game universe. I guess I'm engaged in 'literary archaeology' to try and understand what Robert Holdstock's original concept of Raxxla was.

I'll, of course, pass on anything I find that appears relevant.

And that sums up exactly the problem. ED is a great game let down by the narrative reveal process which constrains the way players can interact with this multimedia experience, to the point that the actual game is less interesting than the related media. For me it’s these forum threads that keep me invovled. Hope things start to improve with ch3 and ch4- weren’t these needed to implement “the personal narrative” concept?
