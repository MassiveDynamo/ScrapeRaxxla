KEY
a keystone in an arch (no idea here)
--------------------------------THOUGHTS-------------------------------------

Gimme your thoughts, I have pennies.

I am not sure who came up with this so it's not attributed to myself; however, there's the Hercules Key Stone Asterism:

I checked out one of the stars in it in the galaxy map - it's WAY above the galactic plane, and you'd never be able to reach one of the stars in it. The other stars, I believe are fairly local - in galactic terms.

Apologies, that's the only thought from me, and it wasn't mine
