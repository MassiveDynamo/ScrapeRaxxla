Right, Pa. As I said, perhaps we need to know exactly what Raxxla is in ED for us to find where Raxxla is in ED.
We mostly assume it's a door that is also the key and a place that isn't a place. A celestial body obfuscated in the outer rim. I hope it still is so.
The RH's definition is very clear. A planet inhabited by people (a TDW schismatical party) with a portal..etc... (Rafe Zetter's stuff)
Hopefully you can find the thread between both, Doc. Otherwise who will ?
