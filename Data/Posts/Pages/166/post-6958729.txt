This is the only comet I've ever seen, and it's a ball-ache getting to it, even when you know exactly where it exists:

One situated at some random unknown distance, in an unknown system, would be all-but totally obfuscated.

thanks! I read with interest the close orbit of the station(s) around the comet.
I have postulated in the past that the station shown in the game startup may be a clue, but that was pooh pooed on the basis that it was too close to the small body to be in orbit & therefore must be artistic licence by FD PR department. Well this comet thread seems to contradict that argument, and to have part of the Raxxla clue shown on the game startup would indeed as MB said be “just a little bit obvious”. So can anyone track down the background star field?

my alternative hypothesis is the Elite Griffin symbol shown on startup, which seems to me to be highlighting a spacific star between its wings/horns. how about a star field match on that?
