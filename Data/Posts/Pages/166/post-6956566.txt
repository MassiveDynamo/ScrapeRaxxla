This thread doesn't appear to go places, so let's break it down a bit....

--------------------------------PART ONE-------------------------------------

"A certain celestial body. Place that isn't a place, door that is also the key. The myth."

A certain celestial body

A certain vague description. Not much to go on. The whole game is comprised of celestial bodies. However, body could refer to 'corpus', in which case "star-map" and celestial body aren't that far off.

Place that isn't a place

Utopia (Greek: οὐ ("not") and τόπος ("place") and means "no-place" or a more loose translation: "nowhere". (Often misunderstood, due to its pronunciation in English, is that Utopia is derived from eu- (eὐ), "good", and "topos", which would mean "good place".) Now, it is commonly used to describe an idyllic, imaginary society. Does this Raxxla story not talk of an elite class wanting to preserve their 'kingdom of heaven' on the other side of the gateway or some such?

Fictional and real places related to the Utopian legend/myth are: Eden, Atlantis, Arcadia, Acadia, 'The New World' aka America, renaissance period Europe,

Door that is also the key

DOOR
a means of access or participation
the critical part that, when opened, creates an entrance

KEY
the key to a riddle (yay, more obscurity?)
a system of tones and harmonies (a sound-bite is the gateway?)
the set of instructions governing the encipherment and decipherment of messages (if the door is also the key, that would be some state of the art encryption)
a keystone in an arch (no idea here)
the key to a map (legend or instruction set to find RAXXLA?)
a literal key to open a door (find the RAXXLA and it will open itself!)
a key in a dictionary (system list? celestial body list? RAXXLA is an abbreviation?) giving an explanation of symbols or abbreviations
an arrangement of the salient characters of a group of plants or animals or of taxa (taxa, raxxla? close enough ) designed to facilitate identification
a clue (but a certain someone promised no clues, I'm confused)

Any other input from the rest of you? More thoughts on this? What doors are keys and what keys are doors? List all of the theories and then we'll see what's applicable to our Elite galaxy.

The myth

Alright, a mythical door-key non-place. Great! [haha] Myth might point back to that Utopia bit or it might be another piece of the puzzle. Or 'non-place' and 'myth' are really just there to say: 'stop looking, the dude was mad and got in a fight with some nasties in his quest for Raxxla. Not much else to it..' I hope the latter isn't the case.

--------------------------------PART TWO-------------------------------------

"on Raxxla there's an alien construct that's a gateway to other Universes"

"On": It can't be a star if this is canon. It might be a celestial body

"an alien construct":

Either an alien (non-terrestrial) or exotic (strange, supernatural, ...):
complex idea resulting from a synthesis of simpler ideas
concept, model or schema
assemblage, structure, building
