I’d add that although Raxxla is likely to be in the place it’s always been since beta, we shouldn’t assume that it is as it’s been since the beginning. The zurara evolved along with the new tech implemented in game prior to its discovery. So perhaps Raxxla was an “unremarkable moon” durning beta and prior to Horizons. But it could have been sunstantially added to since then. Or even revised. Perhaps interaction with it (if there is/was any) was via an orbital station in beta and before horizons but since then that could have been amended to be surface artifacts/stations/ruins etc.

Since I'm late to the party, I'm sure I'm rehashing "old news", but it would not surprise me at all if Raxxla is a Guardian world, perhaps even the Guardian home world. This relates to your comment since many Guardian ruins are on "unremarkable moons", but with the new exploration tools, they are easier to find in a system now, with new ones being discovered since 3.3 dropped. I have found "things" in previously-discovered but not mapped systems, so I'm using the FSS to full effect in any system (in my current search sphere) that hints of interesting possibilities.
