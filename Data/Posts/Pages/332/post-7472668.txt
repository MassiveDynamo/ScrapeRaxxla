The discussions in the thread lately have been really good, all around.
Something I'm noticing as of late is the multiple references to HP Lovecraft which seem to be increasing daily.
Looking at this collection of stories I've found that he has some interesting titles containing keywords in this whole thing.

Stories by HP:
Polaris- Do I need to say more?
Hypnos- In the story they go to the Coronae Borealis constellation (Northern Crown). In 8 Gamma Coronae Borealis you will find the station Love Enterprise. Is this the jewel on the brow?
The Nameless City- (Colonia Pirate Faction The Nameless in the Carcosa system. Carcosa is a mythical land HP wrote about. GG w/ 8 moons in system.)
- Whisperer in Witchspace?
- In Witchspace? We have a Witchhead nebula in the pupil of Barnard.
- Princess Astrophel?
- Seems like a pretty good challenge we're all working on.
- The Persephone agricultural theme-ish.
- This alchemical reference of Ra being spoken of lately.
- Tests? Gimme more tests.
- Omphalos stone?
- Perseus killing Cetus to save Andromeda with Medusa's head?
- The door that is also a key?
- Lucifer Device? Sirius?
- The Dark Wheel?



"As we previously discussed, H.P. Lovecraft’s “The Whisperer in Darkness” may have been the “keystone” tale in which the Universe expanded from one into one including hundreds of millions, if not billions, of galaxies."

One note on the silver key it was the silver key needed to open the silver gate.
Lovecraft’s first mention of Azathoths throne is that “Aterrible pilgrimage to seek the nighted throne of the far daemon-sultan Azathoth."

In the story that turned into, a guy wanders the dreamscape to find the “Shining City of paradise” he had seen many times in his dreams, but then was gone, lost. So he set out to find it. After a varied and meandering journey to find it he eventually thought he was on his way there. But it soon became obvious that he had been tricked and was heading to Azathoths throne (where he deffo didn’t want to be). He had been fed misinformation by the people he had believed to be the descendants of the people who knew where this paradise city was.
So he leaps from the bird carrying him to the throne and lands, to his surprise, in the city of promise he had been looking for. Which was... Boston Massachusetts (yeah boi represent *thumps chest*) the paradise city he had been looking for had been at home all along. It is interesting then, that the Raxxla symbol has at its center the astrological symbol for Sol. Idk what the three rockers around it or the dotted hexagon (not quite correct in the user made representation. In the codex the dots don’t always land in the corners of the hexagon) might mean etc. but it would seem to me that the circle and dot it is probably representative of Sol. Weren’t there rockers in the Gaurdian map that meant something?

Or maybe we start in sol and come full circle somehow through a pilgrimage. Would seem to me that previous successful attempts to find it (otherwise we wouldn’t have legends of it, and we have the benefit of knowing its out there so they have to have some kernel of truth) had to start at sol. Which is the only system we are allowed to see the constellation map from (if thats significant in any way. They don’t always look right and it would seem to me some, even well known, ones are missing).
