2) “no clues” but “some of it is just a little bit obvious” so people know where to start. For something stated as being obvious, to my lnowlage, nobody knows what this “obvious” thing is. So I assume it’s thought of as obvious to people (Braben) Who actually knows where it is and mustakenly thinks that it’ll be obvious to the people who do not. But “knowing where to start” to me indicated that detective work can lead to its discovery.
That's getting into reaching territory. Let's just have the full quotes so it's clear.

Q: Where is Raxxla?
A: Well, it's in the Milky Way, but I can't tell you where at this stage, it's a journey that everyone has to travel for themselves.

Q: You have always said there won't be any clues though haven't you?
A: Erm, that is true... erm, but I think you have to make some of it a tiny little bit obvious just so people know what they're doing, erm, but, yeah... but there's nothing to be revealed at this stage.
