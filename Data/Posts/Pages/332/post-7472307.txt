Raaxla noob here, questions follow:

1) Raaxla is in the game, yes?
2) Assuming #1, have developers indicated that Raaxla is actually in a location than can be deduced via detective work and not just located in some RNG system out in the galaxy?
3) Related to #2, how were sites like the ghost ship in Formidine Rift first found - were there "clues" that led to their discovery?

This thread intrigues me, but I don't want to get too invested if it's all just for naught.
Hey cmdr, welcome to the thread!

Macros has already covered the first two, so just to come in on the third question - yes there were clues - cryptic and obscure clues but definite clues.

My advice in terms of getting involved would be to take the quest itself on its own merits rather than looking at a potential endpoint / payoff. If you're only interested in the destination then it won't be a fulfilling experience. If you like the look of the journey, then get involved. It's a wandering & meandering journey with no signs whether it's even in the right direction, but the beauty of that is that it's ripe for ideas, and anyone could find something or come up with something which might turn out to be significant. Best place on the forums in terms of lore related stuff IMHO.

It's an EBL discussion free zone though - we might have to get you to sign a disclaimer!
