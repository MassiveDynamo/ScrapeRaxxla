Raaxla noob here, questions follow:

1) Raaxla is in the game, yes?
2) Assuming #1, have developers indicated that Raaxla is actually in a location than can be deduced via detective work and not just located in some RNG system out in the galaxy?
3) Related to #2, how were sites like the ghost ship in Formidine Rift first found - were there "clues" that led to their discovery?

This thread intrigues me, but I don't want to get too invested if it's all just for naught.

1) yes
2) “no clues” but “some of it is just a little bit obvious” so people know where to start. For something stated as being obvious, to my lnowlage, nobody knows what this “obvious” thing is. So I assume it’s thought of as obvious to people (Braben) Who actually knows where it is and mustakenly thinks that it’ll be obvious to the people who do not. But “knowing where to start” to me indicated that detective work can lead to its discovery.
3) the rifters were successful in finding where the rift was (before it was listed on galmap) as well as a number of other locations and decifering a few clues along the way over a number of years. The final discovery of the Zurara, however, was the result of its location effectively being handed to the community via some very blunt clues later.

I’d add that although Raxxla is likely to be in the place it’s always been since beta, we shouldn’t assume that it is as it’s been since the beginning. The zurara evolved along with the new tech implemented in game prior to its discovery. So perhaps Raxxla was an “unremarkable moon” durning beta and prior to Horizons. But it could have been sunstantially added to since then. Or even revised. Perhaps interaction with it (if there is/was any) was via an orbital station in beta and before horizons but since then that could have been amended to be surface artifacts/stations/ruins etc.
