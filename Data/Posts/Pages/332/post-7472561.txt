I was studying those drawings too, since Mr Braben said we may want to write down stations numbers.
No conclusion yet.

Do you remember where Braben said that? [Edit: Found it, he just says "we have numbered stations in Elite: Dangerous! You might want to write those numbers down."]

Someone also said that FDev said to "Follow the missions".

I'd love to see the context & cite for both of these, they would be pretty good hints if true.
