Do you remember where Braben said that? [Edit: Found it, he just says "we have numbered stations in Elite: Dangerous! You might want to write those numbers down."]

Someone also said that FDev said to "Follow the missions".

I'd love to see the context & cite for both of these, they would be pretty good hints if true.

Think we resolved the whole 'numbered stations' some pages back: p417
