Another thought that occurred to me - we were meant to be able to find R before the codex existed (at least it's implied). I started going over what information that already existed that you might go on for a lead.. there is _so_ little ! The players manual is an obvious possible source - I spent some time examining the technical drawings on the covers etc. - very little of interest in the drawings, but there is a drawing number, and there are several distinct sets of numbers:

749 942 12 229 Front cover top left & back cover
942 W 12 229 Front cover bottom right & back cover

C 749 942 PL W 12 229 Internal pages bottom left mirrored - this one seems to be the complete number...

Other than that a few quite well know systems in screen shots - nothing odd looking - they do show Styx in the gal map and Ovid has a ship stored. Also Arcturus is in one shot too.

Since we're clutching at straws ;-)

I was studying those drawings too, since Mr Braben said we may want to write down stations numbers.
No conclusion yet.
