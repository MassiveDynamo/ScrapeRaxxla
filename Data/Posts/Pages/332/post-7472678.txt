Since I'm late to the party, I'm sure I'm rehashing "old news", but it would not surprise me at all if Raxxla is a Guardian world, perhaps even the Guardian home world. This relates to your comment since many Guardian ruins are on "unremarkable moons", but with the new exploration tools, they are easier to find in a system now, with new ones being discovered since 3.3 dropped. I have found "things" in previously-discovered but not mapped systems, so I'm using the FSS to full effect in any system (in my current search sphere) that hints of interesting possibilities.

I’ve wondered myself if the gaurdian stuff may hold a clue. Raxxla has alien stuff on it and the guardians are one of but two known sentient alien races in ED.
The shape of their ruins (and the map that represented them) has always been of interest to me. There seems to be something more deleiberate to its design other than its “cool alien looking”. The design certainly seems to incorporate symbols we’ve seen in maps before, could be that their ruins are a map of their home system and has clues about how to find it.
