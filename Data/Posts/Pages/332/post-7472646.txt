So I dig the deeper dive into Odysseus but how come people have written off the Cora story?

Analysis

'Cora comes home soused and raving with wild stories, a new one every night. She claims she's found a map to some pirate stash, and all I have to do is loan her my ship so we can go dig it up. Maybe we should go find Raxxla while we're at it!"

'pirate stash'

"dig it up"


"Maybe we should go find Raxxla while we're at it!"








The only thing that disappeared around this time?





If the non-human relic was stolen from Mars by pirates, This mysterious treasure could very well be the relic. It just so happens that there is a system that has a myth about buried treasure:




Sali'naman === 96.47LY ===> Sol
Sali'naman === 89.79LY ===> Tau Ceti


I know how much ED players love a good scavenger hunt so maybe I can get a few extra hands to tear this planet apart. Regardless on whether or not we find something Raxxla related this planet has a secret to discover.

Excellent deduction. I wonder if the new mapping tool would shed some light...I'm in that vicinity I may have a gander.
