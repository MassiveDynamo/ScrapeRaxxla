The discussions in the thread lately have been really good, all around.
Something I'm noticing as of late is the multiple references to HP Lovecraft which seem to be increasing daily.
Looking at this collection of stories I've found that he has some interesting titles containing keywords in this whole thing.

Stories by HP:
Polaris- Do I need to say more?
Hypnos- In the story they go to the Coronae Borealis constellation (Northern Crown). In 8 Gamma Coronae Borealis you will find the station Love Enterprise. Is this the jewel on the brow?
The Nameless City- (Colonia Pirate Faction The Nameless in the Carcosa system. Carcosa is a mythical land HP wrote about. GG w/ 8 moons in system.)
The Whisperer in Darkness- Whisperer in Witchspace?
The Dreams in the Witch House- In Witchspace? We have a Witchhead nebula in the pupil of Barnard.
The Book- Princess Astrophel?
The Challenge from Beyond- Seems like a pretty good challenge we're all working on.
The Green Meadow- The Persephone agricultural theme-ish.
Imprisoned With The Pharaohs- This alchemical reference of Ra being spoken of lately.
The Last Test- Tests? Gimme more tests.
The Man of Stone- Omphalos stone?
Medusa's Coil- Perseus killing Cetus to save Andromeda with Medusa's head?
Through the Gates of the Silver Key- The door that is also a key?
Satan's Servants- Lucifer Device? Sirius?
The Dark Brotherhood- The Dark Wheel?

-Lovecraftian Science-

"As we previously discussed, H.P. Lovecraft’s “The Whisperer in Darkness” may have been the “keystone” tale in which the Universe expanded from one island galaxy into one including hundreds of millions, if not billions, of galaxies."
