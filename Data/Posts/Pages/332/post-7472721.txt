Is there any clue / evidence that Raxxla is "cloaked" or otherwise hidden, like the mythical planet of Aldea in ST-TNG, and thus requires some sort of "key" to reveal it, or could we find it through a "brute force attack" and / or "dumb luck" (scanning every single system in a growing sphere centered on Sol) using regular exploration tools?

Not that I’m aware of. I don’t think the game can cloak things but they can set a minimum discovery distance anyway (for POI’s). I did read a beacon that says that meta alloys bend light but I don’t think the game can cloak a planet.
