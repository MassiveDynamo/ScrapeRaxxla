Yeah, and if I’m not mistaken, Ian Bell said at some point that Holdstock’s Raxxla and ED were fundamentally incompatible.

very interesting.
Then it turns out that it has something to do with either time or the passage to another galaxy.
Well it is not sad, but they give one more confirmation of the theory that it is impossible to find Raxxla in ED.

(The first reinforcement is that if someone finds it, then immediately write about it on the forum and about it will know at once ALL).
