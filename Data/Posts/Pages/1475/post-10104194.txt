D-2 had a chip, the Guardians also had implants.
She's merely the one the Pilot's Federation and Azimuth Biotech had to be honest about the facts involved. How exactly do you think the Rescue Rangers find you?

Technology 8: Now I understand. This was the missing piece. The monolith network was augmented by vehicle-based communication systems, personal devices and even implants. These were designed to operate seamlessly with the network to provide ad-hoc coverage. Having implants that you can direct communications to you directly would revolutionize communications as we know it. I can only speculate what this would have felt like, but it might have even gone as far as a technological telepathy of sorts.

In short, CMDRs aren't entirely what we have been told. I get the feeling that Monolith Network forms the basis of The Pilots' Federation infrastructure. The CMDRs are likely either genetically enhanced or cyborg (cyborg eyes are an option).
