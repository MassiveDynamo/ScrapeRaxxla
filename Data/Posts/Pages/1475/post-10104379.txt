But I do throw out the novella and Elite1 & 2 & 3!
If not explicitly referenced in ED then it may not be canon, see Allen Stroud’s posts in this thread.

By the time of the start of ED the Thargoids had slipped into myth, with many believing they did not exist. It’s either in the Codex or a Tourist Beacon.
Or a planet, station, etc...

I have to ask why? The gazetteer even stated which frontier system seemingly had traces of alien civilizations. TDW novella also seems to have fairly obvious hints about locations that might be important.

I mean you do what feels comfortable for you, but seems like you are making this harder for yourself.

I am just saying...maybe trusting the space monk that seems have some ideas that can be backed with in-game evidence may not be the worst choice you could make.
