I like the "There's legends, ....erm that need to be tracked down" bit.
The only legends I can think of are Thargoids and Raxxla. Thargoids appeared without much/any tracking needed. But Raxxla still hasnt been found, but the “needs to be tracked down” phrase seems to me to be a hint that there are/were storyline clues to support that tracking...otherwise he would have said “that needs to be blindly stumbled upon”
Well, if you don't throw out the novel TDW and Elite1, the Thargoids are no legend. Ordinary, albeit hostile, aliens.
