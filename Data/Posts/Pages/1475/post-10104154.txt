I think Monday’s galnet post is a strong hint to go look for the Thargoid Listener Lady, Seo Jin-ae, in Ngaruayanka! A clear hint that there’s something relating to the current storyline there.
Shangdi was an interesting choice too...

Shangdi, (Chinese: “Lord-on-High”) Wade-Giles romanization Shang-ti, also called Di, ancient Chinese deity, the greatest ancestor and deity who controlled victory in battle, harvest, the fate of the capital, and the weather.

Chinese salvationist religions
Some scholars consider these religions a single phenomenon, and others consider them the fourth great Chinese religious category alongside the well-established Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism.[3] Generally these religions focus on the worship of the universal God (Shangdi), represented as either male, female, or genderless, and regard their holy patriarchs as embodiments of God.
