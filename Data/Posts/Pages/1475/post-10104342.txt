Well, if you don't throw out the novel TDW and Elite1, the Thargoids are no legend. Ordinary, albeit hostile, aliens.
But I do throw out the novella and Elite1 & 2 & 3!
If not explicitly referenced in ED then it may not be canon, see Allen Stroud’s posts in this thread.

By the time of the start of ED the Thargoids had slipped into myth, with many believing they did not exist. It’s either in the Codex or a Tourist Beacon....
Or galnet...
