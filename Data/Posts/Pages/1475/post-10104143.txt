This one. Holdstock has part of the Talmor Lens built incorrectly at Earth. That said, Talmor Lens had millions of pieces spread out over a large portion of the galaxy aimed at a specific globular cluster - possibly Omicron Centauri. Omicron Centauri globular cluster is visible from Earth and thought to be the remains of dwarf galaxy. Kapteyn's Star nearby Sol is an ejected star from this cluster. Holdstock also had another species living on Mars when it was wetter before the terraforming that sounded like Guardians.
