Well, if you don't throw out the novel TDW and Elite1, the Thargoids are no legend. Ordinary, albeit hostile, aliens.
You forget that TDW novella also has the Oresrians that look extremely similar. Truthfully, we don't know exactly what we are fighting at the moment. I believe this is partly why there is so much secrecy. The Dark Wheel and human leadership at the time worried about breaking news to humanity about contact with another species especially if they looked similar to a species we fought previously.
