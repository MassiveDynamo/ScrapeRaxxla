Yeah, and if I’m not mistaken, Ian Bell said at some point that Holdstock’s Raxxla and ED were fundamentally incompatible.

(I’m paraphrasing but I do remember the quote a bit more accurately.)
The fix that they put in the game to unify the whole thing is Church of the Path in Shibboleth system and Universal Cartographics. Sol is mentioned directly in the first manual alongside the Lakon Spaceways Transporter (oldest ship in the entire series - Type-6 is derived from the original as is Keelback). Similarly, TDW novella makes repeated references back to Sol system and Earth in particular. The problem is that every power had their own name schemes until Universal Cartographics.

Shibboleths are cultural passphrases that distinguish one group from another - historically with mortal consequences. You can locate systems via planet names and stations pretty reliably. Also, the trick with Frontier gazetteer was that several systems had the Federation/GalCop entry and then a second with the Imperial entry (e.g. Alioth was known to the Imperials as Quphieth). Quphieth notably mentioned Donaldson starport which is only in Alioth). This is nothing more than a game of figuring out historical references from past vs current era. The lore is there.
