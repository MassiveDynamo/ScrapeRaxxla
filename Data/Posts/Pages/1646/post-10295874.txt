Do player factions get to build stations and CGs??
Not currently, but it was allowed in the pre-Interstellar Initiative era and it was fairly common for Frontier to run a player-submitted CG on behalf of some PMF in the weeks they didn't have anything plot-related going on themselves (which was often). The later ones like that one were often a bit more formulaic (trade+bounty+creates station) - and there was quite a queue with much more demand than supply for CG slots, so it was pretty random whether or not you could get one.
