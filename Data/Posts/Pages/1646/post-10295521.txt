Though since you're poking around near the centre of the galaxy for the landscape signal, "spiralling stars" works as a pointer to that too.
(Not that they actually spiral unless they get fatally close to Sag A*, but the visual impression nevertheless works)
The Milky Way stars are (mostly) located in "spiral arms", so I suppose they could be described as "spiralling",
I mean as soon as you start accepting poetry as valid clues then literal meaning flies out the porthole...

Nice to see the Landscape signal being further explored, though don't see how it fits any of the clues. Also more investigation into Guardian beacons...the name always struck me as odd, what are they "illuminating"? Why "beacon"?

I think the Brooke Memorial Tour is being undersold. I suspect there's a reason for the route, and particularly for it ending in a system which is embedded in the highly visible string of stars leading to Orion...might well be FD are fed up with us waiting to solve the puzzle and are giving more clues... can't imagine anything else that so closely resembles "a golden chain". The final TB message quotes the Milton passage for heaven's sake.
