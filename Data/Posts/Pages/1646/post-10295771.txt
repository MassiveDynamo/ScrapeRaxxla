If she said "no" she might having been saying "yes"!
Sally definitely says "no" quietly.... lol.... I had audacity open so threw it through a couple of filters to try and reduce Will and the chap speaking lol

and just as the smile is replaced with concern.... just before saying quietly.... nooo.... lol
