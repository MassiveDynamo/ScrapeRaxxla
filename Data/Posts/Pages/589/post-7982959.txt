Certainly a polite 'no comment' would be better than nothing but I'm not sure that the Community Managers even know.

DB knows, MB knows - we know that for certain (we know for almost certain that they know whether its there or not is what I mean)

Who else knows? We don't know, but its unlikely to be many, 1 'chief programmer' (showing my complete lack of IT experience and job titles here) would know if they had to put it in somewhere, maybe 1 graphics designer, 1 audio engineer etc or could DB do it all himself?

Drew Wagner almost certainly does not know (imo 100% he does not know). An author may know but we don't know which one, 3 were mentioned by DB or MB as 'helping' with the background universe in another one of those vids I don't have a link to and I cant recall their names.

If it's in there at all, which we've been assured it is by DB and MB it's probably a [placeholder].

That would be about the only safe way to keep it out of reach of anyone who might leak details.

[Edit: And that's internally, don't forget people have been digging through the game files as well]
