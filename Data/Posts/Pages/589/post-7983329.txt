Ok, so straw poll....

If I (or any of us) found Raxxla tomorrow....Would people want to:

1) Know it had been found, but nothing else.
2) Be given some clues
3) Not even know somebody had found it
4) Be told exactly where it is
5) Something else

Okay, I've given it some thought and my answer is:

It depends.


If, for example, somebody randomly finds Raxxla without any 'process' for unlocking it, then I'd take option 4.
However, if there IS a process then I'd go for option 1, because I'd rather figure it out for myself.
That said if the process is 'stupid' (by my definition of stupid - which, for the record includes quite a lot of the suggestions I've seen in this thread ) then I'd rather not know at all (option 3), so I can carry on pretending that there's a logical puzzle to be solved.

Edit:
As for what I'll do when I find it, I'd keep the details somewhat secret - again, based on what I did to find it.
