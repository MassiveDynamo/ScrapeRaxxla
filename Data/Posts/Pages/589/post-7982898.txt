I am a little annoyed that I received no response to my "Are Raxxla and TDW discoverable in the game?" question. Even if the response was a nicely worded "Go away and don't ever ask me that again!" I did think that a community manager, being a community liaison and all, might have actually responded to an active member of the community in some way, rather than just blatantly ignoring me.
