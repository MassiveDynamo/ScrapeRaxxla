few things

1. DB has a history of putting major easter eggs into games and keeping it secret for years until someone finds it.
2. DB has a history of creating an illusion that we all buy into and enjoy (Raxxla was in the 2nd & 3rd Elite games and definitely in the PC version )
3. DB stated in another of those vids how 'happy I am that someone has finally solved' the (sonogram) puzzle that the Thargoids beacons or UA were transmitting. He was happy that it had finally been solved, at no point was he going to give any more clues or even a hint that there was something there beyond MB saying 'Have you tried listening to them?'

So I don't think keeping it secret is really all that hard, at the end of the day its someones job on the line or a NDA even, and future employment prospects would be affected. Plus its just an issue of trust, most people are trustworthy and will not betray company secrets as they are professionals.

I was having a drink or two with Dave as we know each other quite well. We got to tequila and I had to pop in the question... is Raxxla a thing? He downed his shot and pointed his finger upwards. For a brief moment, I thought he was pointing at the sky but actually he was ordering another round. Then he said, "Raxxla? It's actually in Planet Zoo. You can breed a Rex wassname and a Zebra." I assume he meant a Tyrannosaurus Rex which I assume might be in an update or something. I was going to ask for more info but he buggered off to the toilet leaving me to pay for the drinks. Stuff got hazy after that.
