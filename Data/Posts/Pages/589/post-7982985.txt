edit: probably 3 to above poll

few things

1. DB has a history of putting major easter eggs into games and keeping it secret for years until someone finds it.
2. DB has a history of creating an illusion that we all buy into and enjoy (Raxxla was in the 2nd & 3rd Elite games and definitely in the PC version )
3. DB stated in another of those vids how 'happy I am that someone has finally solved' the (sonogram) puzzle that the Thargoids beacons or UA were transmitting. He was happy that it had finally been solved, at no point was he going to give any more clues or even a hint that there was something there beyond MB saying 'Have you tried listening to them?'

So I don't think keeping it secret is really all that hard, at the end of the day its someones job on the line or a DNA , NDA even, and future employment prospects would be affected. Plus its just an issue of trust, most people are trustworthy and will not betray company secrets as they are professionals.
