I'd be more interested to know how the puzzle was unravelled, but hey - thats why I'm hear - to enjoy the rustle of tin-foil.

Is that (5)? or sort of (4).

It takes a certain strength of character to keep quiet about a puzzle for 5 years and not lead people along when they all missed it completely. I suppose we do have the codex now, but even so..
