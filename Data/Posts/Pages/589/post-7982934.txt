I am a little annoyed that I received no response to my "Are Raxxla and TDW discoverable in the game?" question. Even if the response was a nicely worded "Go away and don't ever ask me that again!" I did think that a community manager, being a community liaison and all, might have actually responded to an active member of the community in some way, rather than just blatantly ignoring me.
Given the communities propensity to go screeching off on wild tangents, "bug... off!" may be the safest response they could come up with. I wouldn't take it personally, that secret will out in it's own good time.
