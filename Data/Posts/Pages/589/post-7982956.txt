Certainly a polite 'no comment' would be better than nothing but I'm not sure that the Community Managers even know.

DB knows, MB knows - we know that for certain (we know for almost certain that they know whether its there or not is what I mean)

Who else knows? We don't know, but its unlikely to be many, 1 'chief programmer' (showing my complete lack of IT experience and job titles here) would know if they had to put it in somewhere, maybe 1 graphics designer, 1 audio engineer etc or could DB do it all himself?

Drew Wagner almost certainly does not know (imo 100% he does not know). An author may know but we don't know which one, 3 were mentioned by DB or MB as 'helping' with the background universe in another one of those vids I don't have a link to and I cant recall their names.

Yes. And " off" would have been fine. I have people (readers) I don't know contact me frequently to ask questions ranging from very good, to down right silly, and so far I have managed to respond to every single one of them. Thats all I'm saying.
