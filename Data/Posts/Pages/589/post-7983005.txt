Ok, so straw poll....

If I (or any of us) found Raxxla tomorrow....Would people want to:

1) Know it had been found, but nothing else.
2) Be given some clues
3) Not even know somebody had found it
4) Be told exactly where it is
5) Something else

The implication here is that someone ELSE is going to find Raxxla. I refuse to accept that as a possibility.
