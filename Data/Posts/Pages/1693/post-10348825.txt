The Jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies could be system Diadem of the constellation Coma Berenices. It represents Hera's diadem who is, according to Greek mythology anyway, probably the closest thing we have to a mother of galaxies since they believed the milky way was her breast milk.
Was looking there again only a couple of days ago, and first looked about 18 months ago...
Nowt found!

Edit
Also revisited Ithaca at same time which is near to Diadem -from Homer's Odyssey...whisperer in witchspace (Circe), Siren of deepest void (the sirens), parent's grief (father Laertes, mother dead), lover's woe (grieving wife Penelope, beset by suitors) and vagabonds yearning (Odysseus' crew desperate to return home after many years)...
Ditto!
