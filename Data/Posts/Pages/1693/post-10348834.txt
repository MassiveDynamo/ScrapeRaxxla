Technically they all are in the hotspot. They’re all good candidates. Have recently been investigating Diadem myself.

I don’t seem able to get Spansh working on my devise - it could be my migraine but considering the garden Theory, I think we need to focus on systems with a minimum of 5 bodies?

How many systems are there in a rough area of the Thetis, Sheela na gig and Fall which have between Four to Five bodies and maybe just one ringed body?

If the garden design is valid its vagueness may not be intentional, it may just be very literal, and its identifying a candidate system, based upon the limited number of bodies unique to that system?

The objective may not be directly apparent (at least initially)…on entering the system, nor either by its naming. Of course having no map legend only Obfuscates interpretation of the garden design (unless that too is likewise hidden in another garden)..

Most simplest interpretation of the Garden Theory - if correct, may indicate it’s on/around/is a singular body in that system, possibly one with a ring and or singular moon. In a system with a maximum of five bodies?

If that’s how we’re supposed to interpret it of course.. it may just be a garden after all…
