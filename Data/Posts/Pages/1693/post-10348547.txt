I allways thought (and still thinking), that if you directly point the galaxy map view to Raxxla (or the system where Raxxla is), will give you a special sound. Don't know why... but I think "sound" is so much more in Elite Dangerous. We just didn't figured it out

Good work @simulacrae.

Maybe itâ€™s the only place where there is no sound!
