Just popping this here in the hope a CM can inject some guidance, I know we’ve covered this before, but I don’t seem able to get through the FD Support anymore… I’ve been thinking a lot about the DW Codex, especially in respect to the perspectives presented for potential new players, in that the text is either counterfeit or obsolete.

@Paul_Crowther and @PhilWeeks I was wondering if FD could confirm if the references in the Dark Wheel Codex is ‘currently’ accurate or broken?

The codex is seemingly ambiguous to the point of being counterintuitive. In that it doesn’t really establish anything, other than the DW faction in game, may or may not be applicable.

Anything else is purely speculative, except the new data of a gas giant location, granted such information is however equally insignificant in the context these locations are in fact prolific.

I am not sure if FD are aware, but there are certain statements online where persons have confirmed on separate occasions, that they know officially that the faction is or was intended to be bogus, which ties into the implied context of the codex.

Likewise I asked this question some time ago and was told the faction handed out a special mission, but when I questioned this against previous statements, about those same missions I was told they were actually removed?

So logically either the codex is incorrect, or intentionally misleading or something is broken?

I wonder if FD could elaborate on the purpose and intent of the DW codex, if it doesn’t give out any actual information is it just an example of environmental storytelling and not part of any current game mechanisms or is it now simply redundant?

Many thanks in advance O7
