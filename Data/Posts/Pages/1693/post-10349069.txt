All parts of the Odyssey that resemble the toast are on the Apologoi - the middle section of the poem, composed of Odysseus' flashback to the Phaeacians who then sent him home at last.

The jewel on the brow is the hard part, so a good reading of the source might be in order.
The only other female obstacle on his way (and thus candidate for "mother of the galaxies") seems to be the nymph Calypso; though it was the hardest one as she kept him as a lover in Ogygia for seven of those ten years (long followed by Circe who only managed a single year).

EDIT: Perhaps we were looking on the wrong place all along. After all, Paradise Lost was seemingly modeled after the Aeneid - whose plot is in many aspects Homer's epics in reverse, where the gods themselves give the protagonist the duty to reach Hesperia (Italy) so that his descendants can found the city of Rome.
Aeneas' nostos is described as the longing to return to the ancestral home of the Trojans - a place that he's never seen
The witch Circe and the Sirens are obstacles here as well, though they're averted with relative ease
Queen Dido, the legendary founder of Carthage, falls in love with him at one point - but gets reminded of his duty and leaves her, the lover's woe getting so unbearable that she commits suicide in a funeral pyre
A recurring theme is dying ante ora parentum, or before the parents; an obvious source of parent's grief
In Ancient Rome, the Forum hosted the Umbilicus Urbis Romae - the navel of the city, from which all distances were measured
...same location of the mundus Cereris, a gateway to another world (the underworld) which they opened three times a year
