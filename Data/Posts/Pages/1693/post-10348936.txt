Was looking there again only a couple of days ago, and first looked about 18 months ago...
Nowt found!

Edit
Also revisited Ithaca at same time which is near to Diadem -from Homer's Odyssey...whisperer in witchspace (Circe), Siren of deepest void (the sirens), parent's grief (father Laertes, mother dead), lover's woe (grieving wife Penelope, beset by suitors) and vagabonds yearning (Odysseus' crew desperate to return home after many years)...
Ditto!
The usual suspect is Cassiopeia because of the Andromeda galaxy, but Hera is indeed overlooked!

Also, a key word on Odyssey is nostos - the longing for home, from which derives the word "nostalgia" - which is the exact opposite of the German fernweh.

Meanwhile I was looking up how other mythologies see it and uhhhhh would you look at that:

A 2011 article from a British historian called "The Milky Way: Path to the Empyrean?" - the title alone triggers all of our alarm bells! - which describes common patterns among some pre-Ptolemaic cosmologies across the world. The Egyptians in particular deserve a good reading, as they believed that human souls could cross the underworld, reach a cosmic tree that provides eternal sustenance and (for the most elevated of them) reach a golden ladder at the top of this tree, which leads to the circumpolar stars.

Also, curse the Mandarin Chinese penchant for words with minimal tonal differences! A while ago I said the Shui Wei sector, notably centered on Achenar, was named after an asterism with no visible relation... but that's the Shuǐ Wèi ("water level") - they added new ones by the late Ming dynasty with help of European star charts, including the Shuǐ Wěi ("crooked running water"), which is composed of Achenar, Zeta Phoenicis and Eta Phoenicis.
