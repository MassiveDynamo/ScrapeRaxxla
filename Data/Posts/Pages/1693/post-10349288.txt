From Wikipedia entry on Dido:


Port Elissa in Carthage - station | Elite:Dangerous | INARA
The companion site for Elite:Dangerous with the game database, market data, trade routes, outfitting, engineers, blueprints, crafting, Thargoid war, squadrons, logbooks, galleries, galaxy information and much more...

Is there a chance that this is a reference to Elyssia Fields from the TDW novella? Especially given Elissa is so very similar to Elyssia. Yes, I realize it is reference Elyssian Fields.

The Elysian Fields themselves appear halfway through the Aeneid.
Aeneas, our hero, wants to see his late father Anchises in the underworld; to enter, he needs to show Charon a golden bough (meant as a gift for Proserpina). Then, upon reaching Elysium, he finds his father by the river Eridanus.

We could say then that every superpower capital represents a paradise of its own: Sol as Eden for obvious reasons, Achenar (as one of the endings of Eridanus) on the Elysian Fields and Alioth for the celestial Northern pole, to which the pyramids aligned - Mizar and Kochab, specifically, as the joint pole stars of that time - as the pharaohs hoped to join it.

(speaking of which, Mizar CD 1 is a gas giant with nine moons...)
