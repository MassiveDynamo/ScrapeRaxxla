I know at some point this probably has come up, But what if the Guardian sites have something to do with Raxxla, because the Dark Wheel missions lead to the guardian sites, Makes it sound like Raxxla is a guardian device. Do the locations of the guardian sites have any correspondence with the mythology map thingy you guys have?
