Tinfoil time! (and a little experiment with Pratchett-esque footnotes)

If the Dark Wheel is an allusion to Aeneas and his Trojan fleet¹, with Raxxla being the site of Rome, the Pilots Federation might very well represent Carthage. Assuming the DW faction is the real deal², them being together is a distraction from duty not unlike the love of Aeneas and Queen Dido³.
Also, the Codex explicitly states that the Shinrarta Dezhra faction emerged in 3300 - the starting point of ED, just like the Aeneid begins with the Trojans' arrival in the city.

Which means that taking control of Raxxla could make them the PF's greatest enemies - and the cause of their downfall.
Foederatio Nautae delenda est, I suppose...

¹ On a less serious note, perhaps a way to infiltrate them would be sending a horse-shaped megaship as a "gift" - though I'm not sure they would fall for the same trick twice
² Which Grandma Farseer's quote in their Codex entry seems to imply
³ Notoriously caused by divine interference, similar to the onsets of fernweh which are suspected to be of Guardian origin
