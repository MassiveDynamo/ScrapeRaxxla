All parts of the Odyssey that resemble the toast are on the Apologoi - the middle section of the poem, composed of Odysseus' flashback to the Phaeacians who then sent him home at last.

The jewel on the brow is the hard part, so a good reading of the source might be in order.
The only other female obstacle on his way (and thus candidate for "mother of the galaxies") seems to be the nymph Calypso; though it was the hardest one as she kept him as a lover in Ogygia for seven of those ten years (long followed by Circe who only managed a single year).

EDIT: Perhaps we were looking on the wrong place all along. After all, Paradise Lost was seemingly modeled after the Aeneid - whose plot is in many aspects Homer's epics in reverse, where the gods themselves give the protagonist the duty to reach Hesperia (Italy) so that his descendants can found the city of Rome.

There's an Aeneas system in game. I don't know if I have passed through or not. Per INARA it has an unnamed (no proper name) gas giant with 8 moons (Aeneas 4). Is this in the right region? Also, as former Latin student for many years (way back in highshool - some 20+ years ago), I love this idea. It uses Odyssey from Greece but flips the story. It is great way to hide something in plain sight.
