Interesting and fascinating to be sure.
First station in Sol is really important. Daedalus was Icarus' father and warned of the danger of flying too close to the sun. It is one the reasons I investigate the way I do. The obvious things tell you the current situation but nothing further. You often have to look at shadows from past or even rumors to get the fuller tale.
