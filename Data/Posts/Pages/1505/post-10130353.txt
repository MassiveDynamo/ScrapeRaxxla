Remember there is a compass drawn with stars in the game!

The four wind gods of Ancient Greek mythology

A series of systems representing the Anemoi; the Greek and Roman Winds (compass) referenced throughout Greek mythology do exist in game, but are not real world stars.

Anemoi, Greek Gods of Wind: Overview & Mythology | Who are Anemoi? | Study.com

Boreas = north
Zephyrus = west
Notus = south.

Traditionally there is no agreement on the east of the Anemoi, however many attribute this to being either: or (both in game) but these with the N, S or W represented by the Anemoi in game, but, technically you don’t really need it, I presume this is intentional.

I feel it’s evident these systems were put in game for a reason. Are they accurate, are they in error, where do they point, what systems align along the Anemoi north and south?

These are interesting - couldn't help playing around with myself. I added in eurus - east.

Although they dont all make a nice cross - if you line up the east west and the north south ... they kind of do... which is pretty cool. Normally i like making a nice map - but ya 3d was better for this so...
