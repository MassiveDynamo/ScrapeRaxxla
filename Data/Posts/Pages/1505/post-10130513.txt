PSR B1257+12 - Wikipedia

PSR J1300+1240,[6] is a millisecond pulsar located 2,300 light-years from the Sun in the constellation of Virgo, rotating at about 161 times per second (faster than a blender's blade).[1] It is also named Lich, after a powerful, fictional undead creature of the same name.[7][5]

The pulsar has a planetary system with three known planets, named "Draugr" (PSR B1257+12 b or PSR B1257+12 A), "Poltergeist" (PSR B1257+12 c, or PSR B1257+12 B) and "Phobetor" (PSR B1257+12 d, or PSR B1257+12 C), respectively. They were both the first extrasolar planets and the first pulsar planets to be discovered; B and C in 1992 and A in 1994. A is the lowest-mass planet yet discovered by any observational technique, with somewhat less than twice the mass of Earth's moon.



Its located far above near the Bootes void (Siren of the deepest void?). Maybe we go there look down at the galactic plain that would look like spiralling stars and super cruise to the jewel that burns on the brow V886 Centauri the Diamond star? or Sol life?

I have always thought the line… to the jewel that burns on the brow of the galaxy, to the whisperer of witch space siren of the deepest void. Could be read as we have to first go to the siren to see or head to the jewel rather than the jewel being our starting location.

also I know this does not make much sense with the lore surrounding Raxxla’s location being within about 100 ly from soul, but what we could be looking for is a door that is also a key, a jump gate that you go through that takes you to a permit locked system where Raxxla is guarded by the Club under lock and key. LFT 509

Another point… If true that DB said that "Hutton Orbital is a walk in the park compared to Raxxla", then it could be a clue that we may have to do a Super cruise in a said system? When he could have just said the journey to Maia is a walk in the park compared to Raxxla
