Yes I did initially notice that perfect triangulation! Been on my mind for ages… wonder what is along its north path?

There is a Yggdrasil system in the upper hemisphere which is likewise very close to it, my notes aren’t available at present, will attempt to track it down tomorrow. But that’s just wild hypothesis, it could mean anything?

I did a quick check for the "center" of these points - its (-13.9/4.91/-27.31) closest system is G 175-42
of course unfortunately as they dont really line up - boreas isnt north of the center etc...
