The whole dam thing will never work, I'm afraid. TDW novella was included with the Elite game, as a piece of marketing. Holdstock put it in an approximately similar universe to the game (that he probably never played) and reused some names from his previous work (reverse marketing probably). He also put things in the novella, that aren't in the game at all. This includes Raxxla, Ophidian-class vessels, Faraway and Oresrians.

The next two games ignores TDW completely. No mention of the organisation, Raxxla or the Ryders. By the time of FFE it seems Braben has a pretty good idea of where he wants to go with the Thargoids. There may even be hints in the news about a third race of sentient space travellers.

When FD starts to float the idea of Elite 4, they begin with a kick starter. This invites pledgers to come with ideas for the new game. Lots of them want Dark Wheel and Raxxla. At this point Braben and Brookes have to come up with a back story for these. It's quite likely that Braben didn't even know what Holdstock had originally intended Raxxla to be. He never seemed to interested in that aspect of the old lore.
It's at this point, that the past is created. They probably did their best to make it fit the old and discontinued lore, but Raxxla / TDW was probably not at the top of the priority list. It was not to be presented to the licensed authors, so details weren't needed. As long as FD keeps this part of history as vague as they have, they are free to write new history as they see fit. We can only guess. There are no answers until someone finds something.

Yeah, and if I’m not mistaken, Ian Bell said at some point that Holdstock’s Raxxla and ED were fundamentally incompatible.

(I’m paraphrasing but I do remember the quote a bit more accurately.)
