Mars Relic being so close in date is suspicious as hell to me. 16 years is plenty of time for rumours to grow and reach Tau Ceti.

In the DJ Truthsayer interview Michael Brookes did hint that Fdev did know what the Martian Relic was. Skip to 14:50. MB's expression seems like he's very much not saying stuff.
You know the games Deliver us the Moon and Deliver us Mars suspiciously line up with Elite lore. Helium-3 lines up nicely with the kinds of projects that the group that founds Sirius Corporation would have worked (especially given it can be created via tritium decay). I would not strictly rule out hints being present, especially as Deliver Us Mars was a Frontier Foundry project so Frontier Developments had direct impact on the project.

Also, you should really read the lore connected to Sacra Oculus. If that isn't a Frontier Developments employee squadron it may be KeokeN B.V. International's employee squadron. The lore is absolutely phenomenal ( https://inara.cz/elite/squadron-about/9966/ ). They also have a minor faction which may or may not be linked to Zende Partners that provides a megaship taxi service to Guardian territory. VandeZande's World is featured in a number of Holdstock works. It has time anomaly storms on the planet. Would have been similar to rocky light atmosphere worlds.
