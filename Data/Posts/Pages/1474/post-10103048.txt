vortexes? is that a translation difference and do you mean "maelstroms" in the English version?
Riiiiiiiiiighttt. I hadn't realised that

So @SergMx you mean that because our Guardian-based tech shuts down, you question how the Guardians beat the Thargoids?

Easy. The Guardian-Thargoid war was about 1-2 million years ago.

Thargoids can NOW shut down Guardian tech because of the backfire of the Proteus wave where it seems like Thargoids 'hacked' the Guardian-based Proteus wave and reversed the field.
