For now let's practice an agree to disagree strategy. I have thought about your post and I have concerns about what you proposing especially this bit:



This throws the baby out with the bathwater. Jason Ryder's ship Avalonia is an Ophidian-class vessel. This is not in Elite Dangerous. You also loose the Ryder clan and with it the first hints of Raxxla. You loose a vital connection to Earth. Earth is fundamentally part of the Raxxla mythos and one cannot exist without the other. This is why the in-game description of Lavian Brandy mentions oak barrels from Earth. You further toss out The Dark Wheel because its' first mentioned in Steven Eisler's (really Robert Holdstock) "Alien World: A Complete Illustrated Guide". This is just the tip of a very deep set of content you would loose. Besides, Elite Dangerous includes Jjagged Bbanner (and thus Dream-Ware and Insight sims), Jaques, and CIEP (by way of Soontill), amongst others. For it to work, you have to have the whole damn thing. Wisdom like stars comes from the deepest darkest realms. You cannot have light without a dark nebula collapsing first. In the beginning, there was only the black void of Hydrogen (oversimplified but you get the point).

There’s loads of that which you don’t lose out at all as they’re in ED.

And you can’t have the whole thing.

It’s been said many times already, but Elite and the The Dark Wheel novella are set in a different universe to ED. So Elite and TDW as a whole cannot be considered canon for ED, and from that point it’s a question of which aspects of them have been made part of the ED universe.

Which takes us all back to the best way of handling them being to consider them as myths and legends, and treat them accordingly.
