Mars Relic being so close in date is suspicious as hell to me. 16 years is plenty of time for rumours to grow and reach Tau Ceti.

In the DJ Truthsayer interview Michael Brookes did hint that Fdev did know what the Martian Relic was. Skip to 14:50. MB's expression seems like he's very much not saying stuff.
