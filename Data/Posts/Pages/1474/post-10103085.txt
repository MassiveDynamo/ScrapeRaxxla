Riiiiiiiiiighttt. I hadn't realised that

So @SergMx you mean that because our Guardian-based tech shuts down, you question how the Guardians beat the Thargoids?

Easy. The Guardian-Thargoid war was about 1-2 million years ago.

Thargoids can NOW shut down Guardian tech because of the backfire of the Proteus wave where it seems like Thargoids 'hacked' the Guardian-based Proteus wave and reversed the field.

I would agree that was first experienced in the old proteus wave system and then the maelstroms as far as I know...

In terms of why it now happens... unintended consequence of Salvations weapon or Thargoids knowing about it in advance and doing something?... who knows...

Although who's sure it as a weapon anymore and not just Salvation uploading himself to the Guardian Internet for his own pleasure....

The only thing we do know is that the Guardian obelisks used to like to ask for Thargoid stuff before Salvation started messing with Guardian stuff and the obelisks started glitching (think we know why now!)... and the Thargoid bases don't get on too well with Guardian stuff as do the space lettuces themselves.... Which would suggest the Guardians were messing about with Thargoid materials and their own technology way back when... most likely to help defeat them at the time?

Think the last two are Thargoid requests?
