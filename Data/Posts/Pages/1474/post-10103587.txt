so I've been thinking again, and started over from the beginning using ONLY the stuff found in the codex and in game. I have treated everything not in game as rumors and speculation (at best),

From the Knowledge base: Raxxla was first mentioned in 2296 in Tau Ceti.
Tau Ceti 2 [Taylor Colony] (or 3 according to the history part the Federation Codex, there is inconsistancy here) is the first extra-solar Human colony. 2161 Tau Ceti colony rebelled against the Federation. Tourist beacons in Tau Ceti says it's Tau Ceti 2, the Codex says Tau Ceti 3.
2250's (give or take) Marlin Duval founded the Achenar Colony.
22nd Century (2100's) saw interstellar exploration taking shape, early hyperdrives.
2190-2230 Delta Pavonis, Beta Hydri, and Altair was explored and colonized.
2280 - NonHuman Relic found on Mars (Included for context that things were still being found in Sol even this late)
