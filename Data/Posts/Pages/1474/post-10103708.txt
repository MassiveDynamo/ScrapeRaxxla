Since we know Raxxla is an "alien planet/artefact" then examining the known aliens is a logical exercise imo.

We've never had any indication of any technological aliens other than the Guardians and Thargoids, so if Raxxla is/contains an alien device it's likely to be either Thargoid, Guardian, or some as-yet completely unknown alien. If it's the latter we can still try to see where that unknown alien race might fit into what we know of "Galactic History".

For example, if Raxxla was an "other" alien world:
When did the 'Raxxlans' emerge? After the Guardians died out, or before?
Did they also encounter the Thargoids?

There's always that "Alien" Martian artefact (that Jorki loves ) to fall back on for another species! ;-)

Just a thought... ;-)
