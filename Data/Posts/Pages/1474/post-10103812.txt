I was interested in it being refered to as original behaviour whilst having a different grid pattern and audio.... however it's quite a long thread now so I didn't see a full explanation...
It’s just people being a bit loose with their terminology.

It’s original behaviour in the sense that the grid of triangles is active and changing with patterns where it’s unclear if they are simply random.

It’s not actually their original behaviour as you say though.

That’s for the display though. I hadn’t seen anything about the audio changing so can’t comment on that.
