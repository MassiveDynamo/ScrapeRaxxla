2200s, not 2400s.

The Empire didn’t move to Achenar. The Empire was founded in Achenar. Duval and co wanted to break away from the Federation and made the long and hazardous to a system far enough away to be able to out of reach of the Federation in practical day to day terms. They chose Achenar and they arrived there in the mid 2200s (as in the century not the decade). The Empire wasn’t founded until later.

You are quite right. 2296 is the founding year. Still tho, taking up and moving along with her followers to found their settlement in Achenar May well have left Some empty starports. Especially in the early days where population would have been lower. Even so, 140ly being considered quite far at the time, far enough to be outside immediate influence of the bubble at the time would seem, to me anyway, to suggest that if we are to look for an abandoned port from a little before then, a search area of 100ly radious of Sol would seem sufficient.
