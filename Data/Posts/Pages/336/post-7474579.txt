If you search for Beor, you will be led to CD-64 139, so it might be ingame, too.
Thirty of the systems build kind of a cluster - two are more off the path: Ra and Beor. Ra is kind of interesting: it has an Unauthorized Installation called "Steelhook Hold", orbiting the 8. moon of a brown dwarf - which is kind of a slightly bigger gas giant ;-). You normally will be immediately attacked by pirates, if you enter the site.

So while you maybe looking for Raxxla, you may need the help of the Dark Wheel first (No not that mob in Shinrarta Dezhra); now where could you find them...? If only FD provided a clue....

"The Dark Wheel operated (and perhaps still do) from a disused starport that orbits the 8th moon of an unnamed gas giant. The station is a Toroid, hence a 'wheel' and ran at minimal reduced power to remain unnoticed, hence 'Dark'. This starport is supposedly the only way the Dark Wheel can verify its identity to new inductees."

So any links between the Dark Wheel and the original game? Original planets? worth a look....

So are there any systems with a gas giant with 8 moons..... Yes and only one... Ra 13 h

Could this non-landable ice planet have such a station? Well the unauthorised installation (Steelhook Hold) orbiting the moon isn't Toroid, but it was a bit exciting dropping in on it in the vain hope it might hold a secret or two....

If anyone is tripple elite it might be worth a look about (I am only double Elite and so the Dark Wheel may not contact me.... do you just need to be elite or 3 or 4 times over??).
