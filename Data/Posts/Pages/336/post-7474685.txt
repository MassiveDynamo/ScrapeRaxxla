So while you maybe looking for Raxxla, you may need the help of the Dark Wheel first (No not that mob in Shinrarta Dezhra); now where could you find them...? If only FD provided a clue....snip...

Edelgard checked RA 13 H, Steelhook Hold: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showt...-Find-Raxxla?p=7466997&viewfull=1#post7466997

Edit: Saw pirates on pirates, Mob Of Ra infighting. Destroyed a few, nothing more.
