I am not really proficient at this and have been trying very hard to figure this out. I was wondering if anyone here knows how to check metering. So I have a theory that in the raxxla codex there may be something to the meter of it. This is meter for those that don't know: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre_(poetry)
The reason I am suspicious is because of this Astrophel and Stella is written in metered Iambic Hexameter, Hexagons are everywhere in regards to raxxla

Anyway I have worked through part of it and there seems like maybe there is something to the metering of the codex??? I am not sure because I am poetically stupid and can't figure this out.

I have absolutely no clue what I am doing and was wondering if anyone can help me write this off.

I wonder if Drew is proficient in metering.
