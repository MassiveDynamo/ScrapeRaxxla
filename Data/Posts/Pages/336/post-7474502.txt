posted this last night this is how I ran into Stone's Legacy in Lawd 26

Just backread, interesting.

I think we need to unlock a series of progressing missions to garner contact with TDW. Whether that is via tip off missions or nav beacons is the question.

Iâ€™m going to cease exploration towards 8+ moons on gas giants for the time being and concentrate on those two avenues.
