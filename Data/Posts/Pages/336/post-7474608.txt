Long time lurker here. I donâ€™t think the sonnet has anything to do with TDW or Raxxla. The codex refers to Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars as a childrens book, not a ridiculously lengthy 15th century poem.

Homage to Alice in a Wonderland -> portal to another dimension

Pleasence Alice fell spiraling [hehe]

White Knight explains song to Alice with this words:

" The song is called Ways and Means
The song is A-sitting on a Gate "

Real girl used for inspiration had a second name Pleasence
