Regarding Shinrarta's logs, i have this:

SPOILER: SHINRARTA DEZHRA'S LOGS

The crash at ID 68 doesn't only happen in this system, but even to others (i still doesn't figure out why, it's not related to station type)
Hope it can help

Edit: Once you done all stations, the next ID to search crash the galmap, so stations are the last 'objects' to be detected.

Mmm, 12 comets in Shinrarta seems a bit excessive! Not seen the “SmallBody” data type mentioned before, but then not looked in the journal specification for a long time, it’s probably been updated...

Edit: have you got a journal specification later than v32? In 3.2 the only body types enumerated are:

15.7 BodyType values
"Null" (eg the barycentre of a binary star system)
"Star"
"Planet"
"PlanetaryRing"
"StellarRing"
"Station"
"AsteroidCluster"
