They don't appear on left panel as "Comet x" but as an unknown signal source threat 0 with no icon (exploration, piracy, ...).
We see the name with logs.

And to clarify: the signals are present in game but when you drop in these signals, there is no implementation of any comet!
But i agree with you, they should have been implemented after such a long time...
No they don't, but they do appear, with names, on your main display for your current location when you drop out, atleast, if they are named I guess,
As per CMDR Pyroboros pic

Anyways, yea, its all about levels of implementation, there question of existence isn't one to be asked, anymore, lol
