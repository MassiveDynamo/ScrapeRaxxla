I guess with the quantity of comets specifically that are being found in some systems, I can give Fdev the BFTD that maybe they don't want to overload us with things to be FSSd or that would be visually distracting or create clutter, especially to new CMDRs.

But still... maybe implement only large ones, or only small ones, idk... but give us somthing, right?
