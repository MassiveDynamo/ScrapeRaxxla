You can locate them, SC to them, drop out at them, and have the name of the comet show in ship panel
They don't appear on left panel as "Comet x" but as an unknown signal source threat 0 with no icon (exploration, piracy, ...).
We see the name with logs.

And to clarify: the signals are present in game but when you drop in these signals, there is no implementation of any comet!
But i agree with you, they should have been implemented after such a long time...
