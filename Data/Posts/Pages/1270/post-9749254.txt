Did you manage to head out/find anything?

Just curious, cuz a singularly named system is probably not proc gen right?
I am still on route out there while also scanning a ton of undiscovered systems, Its between Rho Cass and NGC 281 nebula near IC 1590, it is not Rho cass itself.

I am unsure if it is Proc gen, It seems it is but its a singular one, TBH due to my playtime being very narrow wit hwork I will give the system as a gesture of good will Lyrient KK-C d14-0 its mostly manual navigation through Pludgao and HYPHEEH from IC 1590 and a route wont map, I hope i got my distance correct if not id advise having adleast 40ly jump range or an FC
