Also may I add i found a somewhat hidden system, only 1 of its name, and unless you type most of its name into the map it wont show, Its under RHO out by the rift but until I get there I wont share the name, its not on EDSM or anywhere else

(Edit) just looking at distances, it is just about reachable with 31ly although you have to be very precise with your jumps or you would never path it, auto path does not target with anything less then 40ly jump range and still brings you around it with neutron stars instead which im avoiding
Did you manage to head out/find anything?

Just curious, cuz a singularly named system is probably not proc gen right?
