Mmm, 12 comets in Shinrarta seems a bit excessive! Not seen the “SmallBody” data type mentioned before, but then not looked in the journal specification for a long time, it’s probably been updated...
Comets are in the game since a long time (2017 at least!), but they are not visible until you target them in the galmap, then you can find them with scanner (concentrated signal sources).
But when you drop in them there is nothing.
And some systems have more comets than bodies (can't remember which one as i'm mapping them) but i can tell Isinor have a lot of comets.
