I think there is still some confusion over the Isinor permit. I think I read on the permits thread that FD wanted to keep that system for development testing but accidentally released the permit, so some people had it and subsequently it couldn't be obtained. Worth consulting current permit states on that thread
So Isinor permit is no longer obtainable for people that doesn't have it?
