patch notes for the 1.2 Wings release mention LFT 509 and two other systems:
"Adding valuable salvage convoys to three permitted systems: LFT 509, Isinor, Witch's Reach"
Third bullet from end of “Tweaks & Fixes:” https://forums-new.frontier.co.uk/t...ngs-1-2-wings-content-update-incoming.123776/

HOWEVER nobody has yet reported a means to get the permits for those locked systems (despite some troll on Reddit, unsurprisingly!). The argument goes that there must be a way to do so since FD would not spend dev effort creating stuff that could not be accessed.... This argument seems eminently sensible, or wildly optimistic given FD history, depending on your personal philosophy
I think I already posted my views on that, with some a analogies of how agile projects work ;-)
