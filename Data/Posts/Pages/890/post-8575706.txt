I have permit to Isinor. That fraction is present on near systems. Maybe LFT 509 has or HAD fraction present near, then fraction could be kicked out and lost?
Maybe there is something to do with these 3 systems.
As Isinor permit is obtainable, maybe there should be something to do in Isinor that will lead us to witch's reach then to lft 509.
Afterall, lft 509 is the only connection with isinor so far in logs.
And yesterday when i tried to get witch's reach system data, i saw a second star in galmap exactly as for lft 509 (didn't save the screenshot sry, i'll add it later).
