Hey there. Have there been in history of this search ever considered a connection to the supernova Cas A? As being the jewel. I've seen there has been an expedition to actually find the place this supernova took place, but to no avail, with devs saying it was not in the catalogues they used to build the galaxy map. Was it before or after the Raxxla myth was released? Have there been any updates in the systems that were supposed to be the happening place?

As an offshoot from the Formidine Rift search back in 2016 Cmdr Jaiotu set up the Cassiopeia Project (https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-cassiopeia-project.297941/page-5#post-4667843) to search for Cass A remnant. After some fruitless searching FD owned up to it being absent from the game because it hadn’t appeared in the star charts/databases they used when populating the galaxy. The Raxxla myth has been around since the game release (well actually since 1980, but confirmed only in-game for ED), though I don’t think the Cassiopeia Project was set up with that in mind specifically.
