Hey there. Have there been in history of this search ever considered a connection to the supernova Cas A? As being the jewel. I've seen there has been an expedition to actually find the place this supernova took place, but to no avail, with devs saying it was not in the catalogues they used to build the galaxy map. Was it before or after the Raxxla myth was released? Have there been any updates in the systems that were supposed to be the happening place?
