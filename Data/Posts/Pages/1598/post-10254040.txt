What do you mean it fits the description perfectly??

also i was thinking about the movie we see when opening the game, little srv looking at a planet with a station orbiting it.
of course that cannot exist since you can't see a station from a planet, but i can't help but notice how the station has no lights.

Maybe a little easter egg about the dark wheel? fits the description
The only descriptions, or rather speculations from Rafe Zetter.

"Rafe chuckled and shook his head. ‘You see, that’s the big question. Your father was chasing the mythical planet Raxxla. Does it exist, or does it not? If it does, then on Raxxla there’s an alien construct that’s a gateway to other Universes, and all that’s in those Universes in the way of bounty, and treasures, and aliens, and life…"

and

‘Raxxla’s no alien, Alex. It’s a ghost world. A planet. A legend…’

Planet, ghost world, alien construct. It sunds a lot like that ruin.
