quick contribution - as I havenâ€™t seen this mentioned yet, but Cassiopeia is the mother of both the Milky Way as well as Andromeda

In Welsh folklore, Gwydion is associated with the Milky Way and Don, his mother, is associated with the Cassiopeia constellation.

Apologies if this is duplicative, but it does solidify for me that Cassiopeia is the mother of galaxies from the toast
