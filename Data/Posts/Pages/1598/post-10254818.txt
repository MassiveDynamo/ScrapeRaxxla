That article was indeed the basis of my statement; this is a game after all, so why would FD promote such a concept so heavily, so early on, unless it was a running theme, a precursor of the Guardian narrative?
Do you know why I think Raxla and the Guardians are connected? I've played Elite1, Frontier and a little bit of FFE, but nowhere is there any mention of the Guardians !
