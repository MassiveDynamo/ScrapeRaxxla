The initial missions from the Federation of Pilots, gave the opportunity to gradually find the ruins of the guards, after the ruins found these missions removed from the game.
I think this is the case. At least for the SAP 8 Core missions that hinted of a crystalline map. The finding of the first ruin, did not go as FD planned it. It was likely supposed to link to the vissions of Hasley. Some NPC character requesting SAP 8 core for decoding the crystalline map, was probably part of the original plan. About the same procedure as FD ran with Ram Tah. We missed parts of this story, because the ruin was found to soon. The speed and accuracy of discovery makes me think that there was some datamining involved. The official story is that the system was found by triangulating stars in the release trailer sky box. This is doable, but it went a little to quick. Finding the right planet went way to quick.

There are several examples of suspected but not proven datamining, in the history of discoveries. The finding of Jaques station and several discoveries regarding the UA and unknown probe comes to mind.

I think this has made FD very careful with how the implement mysteries. In the case of Raxxla there is a good chance that FD have had to redo the entire consept. There is even a fair chance that the first guardian ruin was intended to be Raxxla. It fits the description from TDW perfectly.
