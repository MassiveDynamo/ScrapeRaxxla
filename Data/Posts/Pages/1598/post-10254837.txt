True, what we are seeing of the Guardians now is what has survived for maybe two million years - and we're only able to visit worlds with thin or no atmosphere.

A shame we don't have more of the Guardians' cultural heritage, such as the best-known myths, legends and stories. I wonder if they created Raxxla but thought it a routine construct, or if it is so hard to find that in 6K years they never became aware of it.

I still wonder how we found it so soon after going interstellar... .
