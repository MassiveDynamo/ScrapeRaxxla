They had a neural net and essentially evolved into a higher life form / or murdered by an AI (take your pick). Maybe it’s that boring old trope - we are the guardians and we’re in our own simulation, we’re just playing humans vs Thargoids…
There was a very weird GalNet from very early on (26 APR 3304) titled "Utopia Plans for Humanity's Extinction" that seemed to suggest this is giant simulation or something very similar.

Relevant text:
An announcement from Simguru Pranav Antal, leader of Utopia, has addressed the possibility that humanity may lose the conflict against the Thargoids.

“For many years, our Sim-Archive has bridged the past and the future by digitally preserving the memories of countless deceased individuals. Should there come a time when our physical selves no longer exist, it is the Sim-Archive alone that will preserve humankind’s essence.”

“As such, in these volatile times, our priority is to ensure that the Sim-Archive survives humanity’s potential extermination. We urge all galactic citizens to join Utopia and help the collective soul of our species live on.”

Is finding Raxxla the way to escape the simulation?
