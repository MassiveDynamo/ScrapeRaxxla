Hmmm. Just thinking about Guardians possibly being related to Raxxla generally.

Guardian hyperdrive was better than ours. Guardian civilisation was older than ours when they went (functionally) extinct (iirc about 6k years spacefaring). We know at least some of them left mainstream society.

We can reach the galactic core in a few hours. Why aren't there Guardian ruins and structures EVERYWHERE?

We built a space station near the core, it makes sense that other species would too. Within literally a few years of FSD being widespread we've got hundreds (or more) of space stations and megaships scattered across the galaxy outside the bubble. Include Fleet Carriers in that and there's thousands, at least. Imagine how full the Galaxy will be in a thousand years at this rate, let alone several thousand.

Did someone or something remove most of the Guardian debris, sort of cleanse space? If so, why? There's Thargoid probes in every singe system everywhere in the galaxy that contains an Ammonia world, so... did they enact a campaign of disposing of all the Guardian stuff over the last million years? Did someone/something else do it? Or did Guardians just not feel the need for random spread and exploration?

Thoughts?
