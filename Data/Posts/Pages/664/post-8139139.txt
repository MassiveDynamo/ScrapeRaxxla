so it is ! Curious that its not in EDSM by HIP number. This is the correct star, but what a boring place.. just the A star and nothing else - in RL its an eclipsing binary, so really there should be a secondary star.

Now just because there is nothing there, doesn't mean its not of interest - it maybe that its part of a trail map or location line etc.

thanks for the corrections !

Coma Berenices is related to the tale of Ariadne and Dionysus. Ariadne the Minoan, the half sister of the Minotaur. Dionysus (also known as Bacchus) brings us back to the

Catalogue numbers like HIP are always searchable in-game, for stars that have them. EDSM lacks this function. Both EDSM and the game lacks 'part name' search. This cam make it tricky to find real stars.

If you want to find HIP 76952 you will find it in-game, but not in EDSM. If you were to search for Gamma Comae Berenices(Bayer designation), you wouldn't find it in either.
In ED it's called 8 Comae Berenices(Flamsteed designation). Sometimes the game even combines the two. The name would then be '8 Gamma Comae Berenices' (It's not).

Prioritization of names in ED seem to be approximately:

1. Real name
2. Bayer designation
3. Flamsteed designation
4. Flamsteed / Bayer combo
5. Special catalouge number (Gliese, Wolf, LTT, HR etc.)
6. HD number
7. Hipp number
