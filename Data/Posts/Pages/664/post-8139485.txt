Something completely different. As Raxxla is mentioned very early in history, I wanted to take yet another closer look at the Sol system. More specifically, what is missing?

We know that ED doesn't do bodies below 137km in radius, so nothing smaler is considered missing.

1. Ceres: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceres_(dwarf_planet) . Ceres is big and close. It orbits in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and has a radius of about 470 km. That's about the size of Sedna. No idea why it isn't in the game? It was(landable) in FE:2 and FFE, so it's probably not Raxxla material.

2. Dysnomia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysnomia_(moon) . Dysnomia is the moon of Eris. It's radius is about 350 km, making it larger than the Dwarf planet satellites Vanth, Actaea and Hi'iaka, that are all in game.

3. Chaos: . Chaos gets an honorable mention because of the cool name. It's only about 300 km in radius and orbits a bit outside Pluto. There are several similar and larger Dwarf planets, with boring names.

Here is a complete list:

The other thing that is missing in space though is in the system view is the asteroid belt itself.. (AFAIK)
