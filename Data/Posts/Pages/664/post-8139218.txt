I suspect Huneterwithgreenscales is trolling, or at least making stuff up. Unless anyone can substatiate what he said, I think you have to take that all with a pinch of salt.

AFAIK the original game has been reverse engineered and no mention of Raxxla exists within it.

Holdstock's Alien World book does indeed mention Raxxla, and its quite likely he borrowed from it when writing The Dark Wheel novella.

Anybody got Micro:bit mags from the 1990's to see what he hinted at? And the ninth Galaxy - anyone care to discuss its provenance? Definately only 8 in both the BBC and Commodore versions.

[Edit] Hunter with green scales would describe a Raxxlan in the Alien World book, btw..

then we have no clues, which is sad.
Do you have information about the Veliaze system?
As an option, I remember that one of the developers said that in-game news should be read between the lines
