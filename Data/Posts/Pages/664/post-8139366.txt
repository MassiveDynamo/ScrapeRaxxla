Well, I think there have been some clues, “for those with eyes to see”, plus the Codex. They’re not obvious......
Yeah. The no hints comment was made by MB at the start of the DJ Truthsayer interview. To me it's quite obvious that MB means that he want give any hints to Raxxla, in that interview.
When his ED book was released he commented that he hadn't written about Raxxla, because the Raxxla narrative should play out in-game.
