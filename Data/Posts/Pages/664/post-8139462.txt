Someone kindly pointed out my error above - the Northern crown is corona borealis - I wrote Coma Berenices which is Bernices Hair, a constellation that also incorporates a jewel star called Diadem, hence the conflation - its obviously not my day today ! Fortunately it didn't change the thrust of the argument..

I'll return to my cave now for further self flagellation and reflection..
