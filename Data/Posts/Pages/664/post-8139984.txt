After years of playing the game I finally decided to get in on the Raxxla/Dark Wheel hunt and i've been getting up to speed on this forum but here's my take:

The only definitive clues we really have are in the codex surrounding both Raxxla and TDW. The omphalos rift really stood out as "Omphalos" is described as a religious stone artifact. In Ancient Greek, the word ὀμφᾰλός (omphalós) means "navel". According to the myths regarding the founding of the Delphic Oracle, Zeus, in his attempt to locate the center of the earth, launched two eagles from the two ends of the world, and the eagles, starting simultaneously and flying at equal speed, crossed their paths above the area of Delphi, and so was the place where Zeus placed the stone.

Coincidentally the Delphi system has the "Oracle" orbis station. Delphi is home to none other than the Aegis Research division who has been a large part of the center of the Thargoid war. One of the Aegis minor factions is the "Aegis Core" which operates Eagle Eye (possible reference to Zeus' eagles that he dispatched to locate the center of the world). Eagle Eye is a surveillance initiative established by Aegis to monitor Thargoid activity. Using an array of six orbital installations. The Raxxla symbol contains 6 branches all coming together at the center which resembles an eagle eye.



The initiative, called Eagle Eye, involved placing six orbital surveillance installations in systems around the Pleiades Nebula, namely HIP 17225, HIP 17692, HIP 17892, HR 1185, Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55, and Pleiades Sector KC-V c2-4, in order to monitor known Thargoid Surface Sites and collect data on Thargoid behavior outside of combat zones.[1]

I'm curious if we triangulate the center of these systems if there may be something there...I will be investigating this in the coming days.
