Coincidentally the Delphi system has the "Oracle" orbis station. Delphi is home to none other than the Aegis Research division who has been a large part of the center of the Thargoid war. One of the Aegis minor factions is the "Aegis Core" which operates Eagle Eye (possible reference to Zeus' eagles that he dispatched to locate the center of the world). Eagle Eye is a surveillance initiative established by Aegis to monitor Thargoid activity. Using an array of six orbital installations. The Raxxla symbol contains 6 branches all coming together at the center which resembles an eagle eye.
