Ben Ryder is the father of Jason Ryder. Jason was killed for his knowledge of Raxxla, according to The Dark Wheel(Book).

Ben Ryder is also a player in ED. He was part of the group that worked for a station in Maia. One of the factions in the system is named 'Ryder's Revolutionary Party', after him. He is also active in Power Play for Utopia.

It's not likely that the historic Ben Ryder had any special knowledge of Raxxla. 3125 is the year when Elite starts. There is no conflict with any Raxxlans in this period. The first Thargoid conflict is in progress though.
Most likely the events of The Dark Wheel happens some time before 3125. The story in the book is a legend so it's not dated, but we can assume that the Ryder family is real.
There is no indication in the book that Ben Ryder is still an active spacer or even alive.

Corona Borealis the Thetis, Lave and Tionisla are all interesting in the quest, in their own way. I would rule any of the out completely.

About a year ago I read on the wiki of the elite that there was already contact with the Targoids, after that they used biological weapons and they stupefied and are now back. I also read it, but most likely this information has already been lost, I remember that the fleet accidentally stumbled on a foreign ship for the first time and on the admiralâ€™s order they attacked it, it seemed like this
