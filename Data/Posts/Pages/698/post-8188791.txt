Well the space between the stars in Elite Dangerous is witchspace, and Thargoids do seem to spend a lot of time in witchspace, so you may be right there

I seem to remember from somewhere a statement (Macros-is the source listed in OP?) that the thargoids are also looking for Raxxla. If this is true, and given the fact that they only seem interested in their own or Guardian technologies & tend to otherwise ignore humanity unless attacked, I surmise that when (if!) we find Raxxla it will be a Guardian or Thargoid colonisation ship. I seem to remember Ram Tah said there were three of the former, while thargoid ships can be up to the size of a planet (I did hypothesise early on that Merope 5c is one of the latter to explain the goids interest in that system-UA/UP still point there I believe).
