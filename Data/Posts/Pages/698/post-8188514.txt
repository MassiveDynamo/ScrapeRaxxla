I visited them in DW2 earlier this year. At the time one site was being overflown by 3 aggressive NPC. Seem to remember I landed some distance away and visited by buggy.

That sounds like a quest where I die trying something stupid..I do have that 1 efficient small Beam Laser for Guardian Beacons....nah Ill take the advice and land far away

I wondered about the Old Worlds, but on Sunday while I was reading through the codex I checked their Wiki entries. Most were colonised after the first reported rumour of Raxxla. Together with the emphasis on them in the original game etc I think this decreases the liklihood Raxxla would be located there. Cant be conclusive though.

I do think the DW station is significant in the quest though, and I donâ€™t think the star types are correct for that.

Just being really pedantic. Colonised after doesn't mean not discovered beforehand or in use (mining etc). Id like it to be connected to the old worlds and the old lore somehow, not necessarily in the system just connected somehow or a link to them, if its not its not. I don't think it rules it out is all.

Im not sure anything is ruled in or out at this stage though so that's no big thing.
