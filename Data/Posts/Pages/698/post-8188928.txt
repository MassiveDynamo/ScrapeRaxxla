Well the space between the stars in Elite Dangerous is witchspace, and Thargoids do seem to spend a lot of time in witchspace, so you may be right there

Heres another thing about what you mentioned bluewolve. May be unrelated but I thought it was fitting.

Between the stars: An album by Flyleaf.
In it is a song that was vaguely related to another article. The Church of Eternal Void was led by Cardinal Hieronymous. Now, Hieronymous Bosch is another famous artist who painted Ship of Fools.

That Flyleaf album had a song named Ship of Fools the lyrics follow sorry for the wall of text:
SPOILER: LYRICS




















The imagery generally falls in line with my thoughts on this thing. Could just be me reaching again.
