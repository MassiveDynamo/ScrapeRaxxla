Maybe the RamTah missions related to the Guardians might require you to have at least knowledge of his existance?

I haven't done them or unlocked Ram Tah or even visited where he lives (its not Meme but Ill go with that for now) so can test that, will let you know. Got Palins side quests for random Thargoid stuff before unlocking him though so chances are probably the same mechanics.

If we are introducing random (albeit brilliant geniuses) artists as possible sources then Id like to throw The Grateful Dead into the mix.
