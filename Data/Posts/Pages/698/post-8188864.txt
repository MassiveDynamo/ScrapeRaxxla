I think you guys are all correct. Until we find it, or at least see, it we won’t know for sure. Based on all the random stuff I’ve read and the connections I’ve noticed there might be a way to make the search easier will take me several days of testing though. If it doesn’t work then brute force and checking opposite directions of CGs might be the only way.

We have a CG starting tomorrow though so I think we’ll have to choose between going the opposite direction of the CG or falling for the distraction and getting that paint job.

Im pretty sure there’s an audible component to this as well so listen carefully out there.
I was hoping to make an appearance at the CG to at least qualify for the paint job, but realistically I have soo much on my Elite To-Do list and never enough time haha so it may not happen. In either case, if I do get over there for the CG it will likely be only to drop in for a session.
