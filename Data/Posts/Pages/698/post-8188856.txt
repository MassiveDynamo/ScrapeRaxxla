I seem to remember from somewhere a statement (Macros-is the source listed in OP?) that the thargoids are also looking for Raxxla. If this is true, and given the fact that they only seem interested in their own or Guardian technologies & tend to otherwise ignore humanity unless attacked, I surmise that when (if!) we find Raxxla it will be a Guardian or Thargoid colonisation ship. I seem to remember Ram Tah said there were three of the former, while thargoid ships can be up to the size of a planet (I did hypothesise early on that Merope 5c is one of the latter to explain the goids interest in that system-UA/UP still point there I believe).
Well Thargoid hive ships are definitely a thing, as the INRA logs pointed out. Hey, was the hive ship CMDR John Jameson hit with Mycoid ever found? From the base he left from (Trianguli 12) to the system his ship was found (HIP 12099) is not a straight line but is in the general direction of the Pleiades kind of. The Cobra MkIII is a wonderful ship, but does have its limits, so how far could it realistically have travelled to the hive ship? Could Merope 5c be that ship or is that pushing it?
