Sally definitely says "no" quietly.... lol.... I had audacity open so threw it through a couple of filters to try and reduce Will and the chap speaking lol

and just as the smile is replaced with concern.... just before saying quietly.... nooo.... lol



Worried Will was going to break the golden rule me thinks

The way she then smiles, I presume means that Will was winding them up.... but you never know...

I don't think they know about Raxxla. I think I remember Ed saying once, that the community manageres did not know anything about Raxxla.
I think sally is concerned because she know that as soon as Raxxla is mentioned, people go mad in the comment section.
