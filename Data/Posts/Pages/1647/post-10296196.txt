Re: The Link

"Hey CMDR,

Thanks for getting in touch.

So, the faction "The Link" in NLTT 46621 system is a player faction. Its description was submitted by the player so typos can occur.

In regards to your second question:
Is there an ongoing or future narrative purpose to this system?
I'm afraid we won't be able to answer this question."

So that answers things partially. The question is: is that blanket cageyness regarding narrative purpose telling or not?
