It's been 10 years and all we have is conjecture about raxxla and dark Whell. Can anyone really stand up and point out the clues? The Codex has information that needs to be confirmed, but we still have no clue about this. I believe that the aluminum hat no longer holds the heat from my frying brain in relation to this...
When you get told there will be no clues.. but you have to make it a little bit obvious it's damn hard....

Plus there so much going on in the game (especially in the last year) and so much to look for, the needle in the haystack is hard enough to find but when the haystack is the milky way, 3 races (to date) and a war going on we may never find it....

However if the looking is not fun, then you have to sit and wait .... and accept we may never know....

But I personally have learned (and forgotten!) So much about history, literature, the cosmos, mythology, encryption, etc, etc... so there are upsides to the hunt

P.S. Page 1 and the first post is what we know (or think we know)....
