It's been 10 years and all we have is conjecture about raxxla and dark Whell. Can anyone really stand up and point out the clues? The Codex has information that needs to be confirmed, but we still have no clue about this. I believe that the aluminum hat no longer holds the heat from my frying brain in relation to this...
Personally - I believe yes we can.

There is very strong evidence in this thread to solve at least two parts of the Codex, about Art Tornqvist and Cora and the segment about Atlantis etc, which I believe points out a zone or Easter egg dedicated to Robert Holdstock which seemingly is corroborated by FD inserts of the Brookes tour into the same location.

And likewise FD inserts of a Miltonian reference identifying potentially what Raxxla might be and where, with a recently discovered Miltonian model cosmology, plus a whole bunch of weird links to fall down; so yes I feel weâ€™re more closer than ever before this thread moves pretty fast and some of the concepts are rather vast.
