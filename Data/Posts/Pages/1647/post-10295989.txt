I suspect a fair number of employees know about Raxxla, its easy to keep such secrets, but I propose it’s irrelevant as to if they know or not, or how much. Fear of loosing one’s job security and reputation being a better incentive than any NDA.

It’s evident FD don’t wish to openly talk about it, that’s possibly due to one of several reasons.

One could be it’s simply not that big a deal for them; it goes against their core narrative eg it’s not what they want us to focus upon; or it’s narrative.

In regards to that video it’s open to interpretation, but I feel Will is simply annoyed by the (rather underhanded) attempt to hijack the stream and his response was sarcasm.

Sallys reaction is potentially just bemusement; those streams must be rather dull to present; I generally can’t stay awake during them, I bet they probably felt the same; mixed with a delayed attempt to make the best of a bad situation and milk it for drama.
