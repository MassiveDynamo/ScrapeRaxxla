How do you make the spectrogram so refined? where do you get these audios from?
Audacity is the tool most people use and the audios come from recording the game (music off) through Audacity.... spectrogram settings take a bit of fiddling with... if you're trying to repeat someone else's findings generally they publish the setting they use... there's a few examples in the last few pages on here (especially for the landscape signal currently being investigated)

P.S. those two pics are from the cannon discord... not mine.. ;-)
