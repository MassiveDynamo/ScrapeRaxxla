Yeah well, remember that anyone with something to sell, also has an incentive to keep you buying.

Any supposed ‘hidden truth’ is not in their best fiscal interests to reveal, why give the cow away for free if you can charge for the milk over time (you don’t actually need to even own the cow), and keep their audience always wanting more.

‘Hey I might know a little something’ but first listen to this…..’.

Note said person had also provided counter intuitive anecdotal information via other channels to indicate the initial statement made by DB to themselves, was in hindsight potentially, open to contextual interpretation!

So salt / pinch.
