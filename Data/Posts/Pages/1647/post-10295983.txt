went to check CD-58 16 and can confirm previous findings.
empty orbital line in proximity to the star visible only from fss.
only degraded emissions, furthest one was 5k ls from star, nothing unusual there.
checked the two bodies for poi, checked distress signal and irregular markers, got some escape pods that i forwarded to s&r in nearby pandemonium system. nothing unusual.

the only thing that struck me a little weird was the accumulation of signals around the moon (s-one). there were like 5-6 signals in space and more than a dozen around the moon, while none were around its parent body (suontaka). those signals were even close enough to the moon, that the debris you can find in them was being pulled by the gravity and started falling as i dropped in. which was cool, but the only other place i saw this accumulation of signals close around a body was in pleiades... dont know if this is common or indication of something more rare.
