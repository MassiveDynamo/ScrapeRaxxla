ITs an in game RP attempt to remove Sirius (affiliated at least to The Cub in novels) from power. It will probably all turn out to be connected one day.

Caine Massey - the relevant details are:

A lot of 'crashed' ships have Caine Massey containers.
A lot of 'crashed' ships show signs of combat before crashing.
Some of them show signs of maybe Thargoid weapons.

So assuming Thargs did shoot them down and assuming it was because of linked to Caine Massey.....(and this is as far as most people got)

The Thargs didnt pick up or destroy the Caine Massey containers?

1. They didnt know about them, it wasnt linked?
2. They dont have the ability to pick up from surfaces (proven untrue) or to destroy surface object (proven untrue)

Which leaves one possibility, that most people didnt pick up on. And is the answer as it turns out.
