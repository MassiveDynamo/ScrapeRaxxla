Astrophel means star-lover.

I thought the same, but "-phile" means "lover", "-phel" means "cork".
On a side note, if you LISTEN to the Codex entry for Raxxla, Astrophel has a peculiar pronounciation. It's pronounced A-strophel (accent on the O), not Astro-phel. Don't know if it means anything, I just found it unusual.
