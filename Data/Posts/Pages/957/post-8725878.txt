I guess if i were to pick a mythological link to Mother of Galaxies these days it would be Rhea (Daughter of Gaia)

Rhea is the Mother of the Gods... The myth of how she saved baby Zeus from being swallowed by Cronos incorporates both the Omphalos as well as the Galaxy.
Rhea wraps a stone in swaddling clothes and pretends to give it milk ... it spills and becomes the Milky Way... from mothers milk (Galaxias being Ancient Greek for Milk).
The stone Rhea used is apparently often described as the Omphalos stone that became the "navel of the world".

As to the Jewel on the brow... I got nothing .. I suppose it could be the Omphalos itself?

The Jewel Box Cluster is roughly 6k Ly from Sol (just saying) But between there and sol, about 250-300 Ly is the Coal Sack nebula, and I have reason to believe that is the general location of what we are looking for.
