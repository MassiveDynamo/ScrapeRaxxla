Theres a lot in the Codex thats unsourced or left open.

Some people assume that means a Google search of history will help, some don't assume this at all, some assume the opposite, some people probably think something else, some people at Frontier are probably laughing at us all

Its possible that all in-game non-referenced sources are either unsourced or refer or hint at other in-game narrative or lore. Its perfectly possible that the 2 authors introduced in the game are one and the same person, its also possible that the one we do know about is meant to say that authors exist in game and that the Codex entry is meant to stay in-game if not sourced. That its just another in-game author but is meant to be taken at face value, ie the relevant info is that the theory is discredited.(retcon or correction or pointer).

Personally I take the Codex as the retconned version of events, if it says its discredited its because thats now not the story. Looked at that way its quite good at saying what isnt true anymore, from all the rumours over all the years, and what may still be.

Unless it turns out to be written as propaganda, in which case the opposite is true. Look at what it discredits instead
