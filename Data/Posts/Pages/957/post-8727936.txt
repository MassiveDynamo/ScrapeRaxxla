Star Cork - uncork and drink 12 bottles of Lavian Brandy at a Black Hole, dock at the nearest Fleet Carrier, wait 3 months and see what happens / where you are when you wake up?

This was the text that lead me to explore the 'far reaches' of the system.

I get hooked on those. Some are definitely tied to in-novel stories or lore. Some are connected to pmf descriptions or faction descriptions. Some seem to point at a certain system (those around Shin Des). Some are maybe tied to events that maybe happened in GalNet, or past in game events.

Which leaves some, I love them but boy are they confusing and annoying with no solid lead.....yet.

the one you show, my first thought is, is there an illegal installation or a pirate / anarchy installation orbiting one of the far planet?

Anything on the logs from the crashed ship? Inbox message? Still there are re-log? If not just flavour , you still get the money for handing in the data.

Oh, and look around nearby systems in GalMap, you may well find a few similar descriptions. I do love them and theyre easy to miss especially when more than 1 jump and dont bother looking at GalMap every jump.

and NOW they are active in creating Thargoid Weapons in a marlinist attacks (being an oxymoron as Marlin promoted pacaficim and co-operation)

Theres no actual proof of that. So far we have Empire saying they have evidence that 4 cargo ships docked from NMLA....we havent seen even that yet. Im never sure how much we are just supposed to take at face value for story without any evidence and how much we are supposed to question or 'see through'. We only have the one version and the reply / denial from the Marlinists, nobody from the NMLA has officially commented on this aspect, yet.
