So, interesting find on the 8th Moon of System well within the bubble.
A Crashed Ship - Anaconda
The Ships Data Core - Scanned (nothing?)
Thargoid Sensor
Interesting Crates
SPOILER: CRASHED SHIP ON AN 8TH MOON?











I couldn't re-scan the Ship's Data Core even after closing Elite and re-starting, but I don't know if that's usual or not so if anyone can clarify what's expected there that'd be great! I might have to come back with a corrosive rack to pickup the Thargoid Sensor...

It also seems like Galaxy > System Descriptions might actually have some in-game alignment (who'd have thought), I found this after getting curious with the description I noted, so I'm hoping the others I'm investigating might also turn up some interesting stuff.

Then I was forced off the game for an update - so will have to wait to explore further later!!

Edit: Did some follow-up research and the boxes sound the same as those from the and . So could be re-used graphics, or leading us to investigate Brewer Corp and Caine-Massey more?

Oh, I just realised my screenshots didn't have the system! Sorry!

It's Skeggiko O B 8 - there are 3 Human Signals, Cabot's Inheritance, Hewish's Inheritance, and the Crashed Ship.

This was the text that lead me to explore the 'far reaches' of the system.
