Do you think it could be a red herring? It's weird how it says that the resemblence was eventually discredited. I wonder how it was discredited. I'd also like to know if it's just a coincidence that there is a real life story with the same name or the author of the codex knew. I had a look into the failed author in galnet archives. He wrote a series of books called the corsair King which again there is a real life book of the same name. The real life version is about a pirate. The corsair king is also a game of thrones character which seemed interesting. The in game author does a runner after his fans keep demanding he changes the narrative to suit them
I'm having trouble following your reasoning here. In the Codex the book is called "Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars". How does the Corsair King come into it?

Sir Philip Sydney's poem is call Astrophel and Stella. Astrophel means star-lover. Its not a children's story for sure and its not about or connected to a princess. It always seemed to me to be one of those Google coincidences. Certainly there have been many theories about it but none convincing. I wonder if its possible that its a book cipher as its a large text of which there are only I think 2 variants easily obtainable. To apply it as one would require a cipher text , usually numeric in nature. I dont think we have a candidate for that.

It would be unkind, to say the least to give what is a very direct hint about gg8's and then to wave it off as a fake. On the otherhand if we asume that the base in And Here The Wheel is one of TDW bases, then it wouldn't fit the 8th moon bit either.

I'm sure that a thorough search of the Lanaest/Grandamort area was performed previously - perhaps someone could pipe up and say what was searched etc.
