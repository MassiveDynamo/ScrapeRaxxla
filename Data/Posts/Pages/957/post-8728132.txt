Oh, I just realised my screenshots didn't have the system! Sorry!

It's Skeggiko O B 8 - there are 3 Human Signals, Cabot's Inheritance, Hewish's Inheritance, and the Crashed Ship.

This was the text that lead me to explore the 'far reaches' of the system.

The crash with UA that I visited was Mandhrithar, B3 (36.29, -178.43)-nearest UA/TS to Palin at Arque! Apparently similar at Solati, Halla (-70.99, -156.44) and DT Virginis, A2a ( -3.55, 112.13).
Still cant remember where I got the information from, but reasonably positive it was an online utility.

but found this Reddit post with associated surface site list
