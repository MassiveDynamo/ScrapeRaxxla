With google searches comes Cruel tricks of fate with players creativity going into places devs didn't know existed.
With my experience of Valve and their args, straw grasping for Half life clues had it's drawbacks, because the name Gordon Freeman, is not unique to Half Life, and one of the portal 2 potatoes arg, was interpreted in such a way it led to an old text which had the name Gordon Freemen, coincidence???? Well actually, yet it was.
There is even an author called Gordan freeman, (https://www.amazon.com/Gordon-R.-Freeman/e/B0037E3TR2?ref=dbs_a_mng_rwt_scns_share)

Coincidence, life imitating art, dev's can cruely read public messageboards and slip in snippets of fans headcanon/theories into the game forming a weird bias-confirmed-feedback-loop.
The original portal team did this when they saw a fan who noticed the initials for Apeterure Science - A S, was the initials for Adrian Shepherd from Half Life opposing forces, and sneakily (very late into the production) altered the colours of the letters on the keyboards that both AS's had in common on all keyboards in the first portal game, which just poured gasoline on the fire because people started to wonder why were 4 keys in "orange"...oh look it's the same letters needed to spell out Adrian Shepherd.



I pitch my latest rendtion on my 2 year old Raxxla/Odyssey theory as I saw how the Scylla system lies next to Liz Ryder the engineer (Ryder family having dark wheel connections) who fell out with the family business when she made connections to the Eurybia Blue Mafia - and NOW they are active in creating Thargoid Weapons in a marlinist attacks (being an oxymoron as Marlin promoted pacaficim and co-operation) - Coincidence????? Yeah probably......
