Now I am interested ! The psycho-penguin is walking his own dark journey . Just as we were told to do !
About clues and what is obvious, the connection between TDW and Raxxla (obviously) and 'Raxxla is something different.' That's all. I don't think the Codex gives any.
It has been put there just to muddy the water, to give the illusion of some depth and so to make us play their game. Just some more well known FD fluff.
My deep feeling is that we are living a "no-Raxxla" interval in the game development. From the suppression of the E/F missions to late 2020, being optimistic... much.

EDIT: wich reminds me DW's "last hurrah" hypothesis. Bound to 'FD told us writers: don't touch Raxxla, nor Thargs', makes me think Raxxla could very well be at the roots of the Thargs storyline... (Also antigravity. Seems that only Thargs and Guardians were granted to master it.)
All these 'stars' spiraling out of Raxxla...
