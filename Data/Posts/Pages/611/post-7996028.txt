March 26 2019. My first visit there.
Imo it just implies that I was on the right track and that the methods are sound.
Also worth mentioning is that I've been working on something I call the "Major Discovery Experiment" for some time.
If you punch "Major" into your nav and hit the search tab you will be lead to 4 different systems by hitting the search tab 4x. Arcturus, Van Maanen, Epsilon Eridani, and Pi-Fang.
Got fully allied with all 4 systems and received 2 tip-offs in the process. FYI, the more allied you are with a system the more likely tip-offs will occur when you donate money.
Each system contains a planet named Major. In the case of Arcturus you will see it has Major, Richard's Rock with a station named Fort Harrison
and next to that the planet Discovery.
I believe I've cracked what this "Major Richard/Harrison Discovery" is (Philip K "Richard" and Harrison Ford) but you also find the planet Arcas in Arcturus.
Arcas was the King of Arcadia.
