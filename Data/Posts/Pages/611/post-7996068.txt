For the record I'm fully aware of what all of it, this whole experience means. The trouble is in what could happen if I told you.

"One day, when Arcas went hunting in the woods, he came across his mother. Seeing her son after so long, she went forth to embrace him. Not knowing that the bear was his mother, he went to kill her with an arrow. Zeus however, watching over them, stopped Arcas from shooting Callisto, and turned Arcas into a bear, then putting them into the stars. They are now referred to as Ursa Major and Ursa Minor, the big and little bears."
Here, stumbled across this on the IAU site, you might like the multiple comparative mythologies.

[Edit: Quote: "All 88 constellations officially sanctioned by the International Astronomical Union are listed in the table below, plus the Milky Way and the aurora." (Found in the References footer of this IAU page.)]
