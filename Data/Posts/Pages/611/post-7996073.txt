With 100,000 systems, stations and planets in the Bubble it's supremely easy to make connections - especially tenuous ones like 'Philip K == Richard'.

If you read the Formidine Rift thread (currently hiding in the Exploration forum) you'll find the post where I linked every single element of the Rift storyline to Pink Floyd.

With no clues to narrow things down, we have too many data points and everything seems connected - see also Douglas Adams' "Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency", which is, in itself, another connection. See how easy it is?
that makes sense, 'shine on you crazy diamond' is one of my favorite songs to play when I'm doing trade or exploration
