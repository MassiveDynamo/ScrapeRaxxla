March 26 2019. My first visit there.
Imo it just implies that I was on the right track and that the methods are sound.
Also worth mentioning is that I've been working on something I call the "Major Discovery Experiment" for some time.
If you punch "Major" into your nav and hit the search tab you will be lead to 4 different systems by hitting the search tab 4x. Arcturus, Van Maanen, Epsilon Eridani, and Pi-Fang.
Got fully allied with all 4 systems and received 2 tip-offs in the process. FYI, the more allied you are with a system the more likely tip-offs will occur when you donate money.
Each system contains a planet named Major. In the case of Arcturus you will see it has Major, Richard's Rock with a station named Fort Harrison
and next to that the planet Discovery.
I believe I've cracked what this "Major Richard/Harrison Discovery" is (Philip K "Richard" and Harrison Ford) but you also find the planet Arcas in Arcturus.

With 100,000 systems, stations and planets in the Bubble it's supremely easy to make connections - especially tenuous ones like 'Philip K == Richard'.

If you read the Formidine Rift thread (currently hiding in the Exploration forum) you'll find the post where I linked every single element of the Rift storyline to Pink Floyd.

With no clues to narrow things down, we have too many data points and everything seems connected - see also Douglas Adams' "Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency", which is, in itself, another connection. See how easy it is?
