Now I am interested ! The psycho-penguin is walking his own dark journey . Just as we were told to do !
About clues and what is obvious, the connection between TDW and Raxxla (obviously) and 'Raxxla is something different.' That's all. I don't think the Codex gives any.
It has been put there just to muddy the water, to give the illusion of some depth and so to make us play their game. Just some more well known FD fluff.
My deep feeling is that we are living a "no-Raxxla" interval in the game development. From the suppression of the E/F missions to late 2020, being optimistic... much.

I actually came to it from the other direction. After the Rift finished I had no active goal, so I was wondering what to do. Since the thing that makes ED special for me is the 'real world' galaxy, I hit upon the idea of visiting all the catalog systems in the game. So I fired up Wikipedia, picked a constellation, bookmarked all the listed systems (not just the alphas, betas, etc - all the HIPs, HDs and HRs) in it and headed out. I'm currently heading back from completing my 19th constellation.

It was only subsequently that I realized that this goal could conceivably overlap with the 'journey' needed to find Raxxla. I'm closing in on my 1,000th HR system, so my fingers are firmly crossed at this point
