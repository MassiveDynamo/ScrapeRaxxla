With 100,000 systems, stations and planets in the Bubble it's supremely easy to make connections - especially tenuous ones like 'Philip K == Richard'.

If you read the Formidine Rift thread (currently hiding in the Exploration forum) you'll find the post where I linked every single element of the Rift storyline to Pink Floyd.

With no clues to narrow things down, we have too many data points and everything seems connected - see also Douglas Adams' "Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency", which is, in itself, another connection. See how easy it is?

The difference between you and I is that I believe there are clues. "You have to make it a little bit obvious" according to MB. This implies that the clues exist. They may not have told you the clues (which I doubt) but that they exist. It's easy to draw connections across so many different mythologies and such,
but which ones give "consistency to the fragmentary rumors"? If you cannot provide consistency, than it's a flop.
I also believe that due to language and interest barriers, by design, there should be a way to relate things in more ways than one. This creates a level playing field for all involved in the quest. Also, not surprised by Floyd tying into any and all of it. Floyd is about the human experience and that alone encompasses a whole hell of a lot in regards to stuff like the rift mysteries and beyond. This too imo is by design.
