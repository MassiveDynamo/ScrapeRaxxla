Interesting point of contention here, our Moon does NOT have a "dark side", at all!

Due to tidal locking the Moon does have a side we cannot see from our limited point of perspective here on Earth but, as the Moon rotates around the Earth, any given point on the Lunar equator is in full Sun-light for a period of roughly fourteen days followed by darkness for a further fortnight.

At full Moon the side facing us is fully lit by the Sun, at new Moon the opposite side is fully lit.

As I recall, that was the conclusion I came to - that we should be looking for a tidally locked moon

Don't let @GURU-951 spoil the theory by bringing unnecessary facts into it - it's all FAKE NEWS!!!
