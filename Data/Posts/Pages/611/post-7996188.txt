Alternatively:

Mother of Galaxies - President Halsey
Parent's Grief - Gan Romero's mom
Lover's Woe - That Imperial chick who was going to marry a Fed but didn't
Whisperer in Witchspace - The Formidine Rift Exodus logs
Siren - The Alliance Festival of Culture
Vagabonds - Those refugees that got stuck someplace
