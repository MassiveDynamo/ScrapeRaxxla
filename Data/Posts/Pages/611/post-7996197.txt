I was simply stating what the album was about. I'm sure you are looking for a tidally locked moon.
Have you not found one yet? They're everywhere.

They're generally tidally locked to the parent body. You'd need to find one in an orbit such that it perpetually presented one face to the 'grandparent' star as it orbits its parent body.

If my 3d spatial awareness is functioning properly you'd want a moon in an orbit perpendicular to the planet's orbit around the star. That would mean the 'bottom' of the moon would always be in darkness.
