Yes, I don't think there is anything special about that picture. I really hope there was. I want to do mis-jumps, explore witch-space, use alien devices to calculate the witch-space construct, or ultradimension, with different rules and end up in unexpected places. Also wormholes, interstellar subsystems and bypassing permit restrictions. Perhaps the true Raxxla is that creeping calling in subconsciousness that says "quit your job and start writing esoteric sci-fi novels".
