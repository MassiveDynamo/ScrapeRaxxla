Hello, been keeping up with this off and on for a year or two, finally contributing my idea.

The name Raxxla itself is the clue, but its coordinates, atomic number of Radium(Ra) is 88, Lanthanium(La) 57, so 88,xx,57 and it just so happens there is a system that is dead nuts on those galactic coordinates. ICZ OI-S b4-3

Ive already jumped to and scaned everything obvious in the system with no luck, there are two landable planets though.

Another idea using information from periodic table of elements is that maybe raxxla could also be used backwards, so you end up with Aluminum(Al) 13, XX, Argon(Ar)18, those two elements are on the same line on the table and there is also two single letter elements and two double letter elements between them. So maybe some combination of either the single letter or double letter elements define the surface coordinates.

"A door that is also a key"

I like this idea. It makes sense. Maybe there is something to be found on those planet's surfaces.
