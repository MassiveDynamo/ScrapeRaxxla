I had a some new bodies in either Maia or Merope once (can’t quite remember which it was). I’d ADS scanned previously, but am in the habit of doing it every time I jump into a system, and on one jump got some new bodies discovered. As far as I could tell there weren’t any actual new bodies.

Had it happen to me a few times, sometimes out in FR, and other regions. Sometimes minutes between honk, finding initial immediate objects, and then -poof!- more found.

Not saying it is a bug, but could be a bug


I have a vague feeling it happened to me too in either Maia or Merope. Seem to remember some forum discussion of whether it was meaningful or not , & then it was interpreted (FD statement??) as a bug. A search of bug report thread might be fruitful.
