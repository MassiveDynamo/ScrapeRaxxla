It isn't a confirmation that Polaris is Raxxla but it is a confirmation that Thargoid technology is leaps and bounds beyond our own. In FFE the player could utilize this alien portal to transport to what is assumed to be the Thargoid homeworld. I don't think that Raxxla is Polaris but I wouldn't rule out the probability that access to Polaris, along with a friendly standing with the Thargoids, could unlock the alien portal that just might be the key/door to accessing Raxxla. I honestly think that this could be the secret that allowed Jason Ryder to locate Raxxla in The Dark Wheel which took place around the time of mankind's first engagements with the Thargoids.

It would be a bit strange to have Raxxla show up in Polaris. It's one of the systems that every player visited in FFE. It's a bit to well explored to have something 'old' added.
