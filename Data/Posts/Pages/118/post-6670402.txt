I wasn't, as I've never played that! Perhaps that is 100% confirmed then!? The plan is more to see if we can get past the permit locked issue. If we can, then we can actually start trying out permit locked systems elsewhere

It isn't a confirmation that Polaris is Raxxla but it is a confirmation that Thargoid technology is leaps and bounds beyond our own. In FFE the player could utilize this alien portal to transport to what is assumed to be the Thargoid homeworld. I don't think that Raxxla is Polaris but I wouldn't rule out the probability that access to Polaris, along with a friendly standing with the Thargoids, could unlock the alien portal that just might be the key/door to accessing Raxxla. I honestly think that this could be the secret that allowed Jason Ryder to locate Raxxla in The Dark Wheel which took place around the time of mankind's first engagements with the Thargoids.
