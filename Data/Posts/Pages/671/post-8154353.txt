That is something I had never properly considered before. Upon finding Raxxla, it would make sense to have some incentive to not tell everyone about it right? I can’t think of much else apart from what you have mentioned above. Maybe a weekly bribe to keep your mouth shut?

Some easy access to rare resources, discount ships and modules, and big payout missions through special permits that you lose if the knowledge goes public. A special guestbook kind of beacon maybe. All of that seems easily doable with current game mechanics so I agree it is probably more likely than another galaxy to explore.

Imagine if finding Raxxla makes it move to another system in the galaxy? So you could tell people about it but just the act of finding it means it is lost again.

I wouldn’t be surprised if finding it would paint a target on your ship. Every system you go to you are wanted and there are shady midnight black ships constantly trying to take you out to prevent the secret from being shared. Obviously that wouldn’t stop you just logging out of the game to share the info online, but it would make sense from an immersion perspective.

It would be hilarious if finding Raxxla gives an instant IP ban to the forums hahaha
