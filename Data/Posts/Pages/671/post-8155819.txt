It is far less realistic than would warrant not having other galaxies or alternate universes or by having raxxla jump system to system.

It isn't even internally consistent on very well know objects like Betelgeuse still existing... Among many other things. Pretending it is an accurate simulation above sci fi tropes is just ignoring the reality of the game.
Yeah I have to agree with this.

Firstly, wormholes are consistent with the general theory of relativity, which doesn’t exactly prove they exist but certainly allows that they could.

Even if they weren’t, we have plenty of examples of liberties being taken to enhance the gameplay experience. FTL travel is a huge one, not to mention jumping through hyperspace. Could even claim Clarke’s 3rd law if absolutely necessary.
