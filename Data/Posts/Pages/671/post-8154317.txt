How about something like:

A visitor beacon that you get your name 'signed' on for ever if you keep it quiet. Only you and other visitors will know who has been.
Once its open news, the visitor beacon is stopped from registering new Cmdrs and your name is removed if you spilled the beans.
While it is still 'unknown' you get some permit locked / only in range from Raxxla systems to jump to, once known everyone loses the permit.

Something like this may keep it a secret if found....although with the internet these days I doubt it.
