It is far less realistic than would warrant not having other galaxies or alternate universes or by having raxxla jump system to system.

It isn't even internally consistent on very well know objects like Betelgeuse still existing... Among many other things. Pretending it is an accurate simulation above sci fi tropes is just ignoring the reality of the game.
Betelgeuse could have nova'd in the 14th century and we wouldn't have seen it yet (although I've flown by several times and it's still there) and the predictions on when it might happen are sketchy, at best.

Have you already visited all 400 billion systems in the current sandbox before demanding any more?
