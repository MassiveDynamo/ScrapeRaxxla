Reddit poster - sounds a lot like a 'psychic' to me, ie a cold reader, someone who makes general statements that can apply to many things and then its up to the finder to make the link and think the other person knows more or is gifted in some way. See Salome thread for when it goes wrong and the answer specifically denies any of the 'hints' or 'insights' given by the person. The fact that @evreybody is part of it shows no respect for players etc as stated so pure .

Liking the concept art though...where theres muck theres brass. (Theres one for google translator Ill bet)
