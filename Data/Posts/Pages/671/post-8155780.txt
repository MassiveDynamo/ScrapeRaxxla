You're coming up with some interesting and creative ideas on how Raxxla might be implemented but you might find you're pushing up against one of the very few factors of ED with internal consistency: This product's key differentiating quality, the "realistic" 1:1 Milky Way galaxy generated by Stellar Forge.

I'm not convinced DB would abandon that in favour of a free to play MMO limited prize grab mechanic.

It is far less realistic than would warrant not having other galaxies or alternate universes or by having raxxla jump system to system.

It isn't even internally consistent on very well know objects like Betelgeuse still existing... Among many other things. Pretending it is an accurate simulation above sci fi tropes is just ignoring the reality of the game.
