I wonder if the body IDs are really signal sources? Are they the same / same numbers on each visit?

With the Buckyball Racing Club event in Pareco over, I stopped by Terra Mater and mapped the 7th moon and flew around it and also looked, visually, for an 8th moon but saw nothing. I moved on to Asphodel and docked at Saavik's Sanctuary (a couple of nice G3 items in the shop, an Artemis with damage resistance and a P-15 with fast handling, which I left there). Not sure what to look for, really, so I made a flyby of the ringed 8th moon in the Run system, mapped it, and saw nothing visually. I proceeded to check out a few HIP catalogue systems around the lost worlds region looking for more 8th moons but I'm kind of at a loss on how to look for anything.

Eventually, I gave it a break and went back to Sol to convert my Asp Explorer Mneme back to a long range explorer from her A* racing configuration, which meant engineering new shields and a PP. At Marco Qwent's base on Lucifer, I decided to disembark and see what it was like. In his office was a rolling sequence of images on a screen and I thought it looked, well, 'hint-like'. The numbers repeat on other screens so I'm not convinced they mean anything but when I see a map of the Milky Way with a couple of locations marked on it, it does make me wonder - although it could very well just be background flavour, I think one location looks like Colonia (again, could be wrong about that).
