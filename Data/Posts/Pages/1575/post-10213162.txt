Narcotics smugling has been part of Elite, since the first game. To leave it out completely, would not go down well with backers and fans. Onionhead is more ambiguous. We don't really know if it's harmful or not. There has been plenty of political drama around the Onionhead story. One can always hope there is more to the story, than just a toned down drug smugling option.

When it comes to instructions, I guess that is where the Dark Wheel will have a function eventually. Unfortunately I doubt that they have started inviting people yet. There are to many players with Elite in everything and all the ranks, for us not to have heard about anything.
Onionhead makes you cry!
