Looking at these search strings, I reached a conclusion.
I'm waaaay more adept at recognizing binary patterns on decimal numbers than it should be healthy.

And it tells a little about how Stellar Forge handles these numbers. See - the main (in this case only) star in this system ends on 6, and if you subtract 6 from several of those values - or cut the 6 or 06 at the end - you get a power of 2.
So, after some bit massaging, what I found was that, if you cut the bottom 16 bits (which, in less nerdy terms, means dividing by 256)...

You get the Body# value on the left. Meh.

...although, if the expected values misalign or something, that'd be a weird anomaly.
Theres a video on it
