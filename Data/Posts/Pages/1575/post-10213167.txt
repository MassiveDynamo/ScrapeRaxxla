Narcotics smugling has been part of Elite, since the first game. To leave it out completely, would not go down well with backers and fans. Onionhead is more ambiguous. We don't really know if it's harmful or not. There has been plenty of political drama around the Onionhead story. One can always hope there is more to the story, than just a toned down drug smugling option.

When it comes to instructions, I guess that is where the Dark Wheel will have a function eventually. Unfortunately I doubt that they have started inviting people yet. There are to many players with Elite in everything and all the ranks, for us not to have heard about anything.
How true.

The DW I suspect is likely no longer an active force in game, as you’ve identified the simply huge number of Cmdrs means such a ‘clandestine group’ could not maintain its anonymity upon entry, not unless you apply some type of community element, otherwise it would become an integral and huge element in game which could overshadow everything.

Personally I believe FD applied a clever version of retconning; by essentially inferring the in game faction was bogus (an insight Drew confirmed). You don’t need to have a real DW, it remains a fiction, an unknown.

We as Cmdrs were led to believe otherwise, through our manuals etc.. but not intentionally, simply due to an absence in information. However a ticket was raised on this subject, and it essentially confirms there is no test.

Personally I feel this indicates there is no DW. However, I presume the new data in the codex essentially affirms there is a DW station. My guess is it’s a dead station with voice logs….

The system’s identified regarding Onion head are actually very far removed from the general Underworld sector. I feel if this is relevant, more data is required.
