How true.

The DW I suspect is likely no longer an active force in game, as you’ve identified the simply huge number of Cmdrs means such a ‘clandestine group’ could not maintain its anonymity upon entry, not unless you apply some type of community element, otherwise it would become an integral and huge element in game which could overshadow everything.

Personally I believe FD applied a clever version of retconning; by essentially inferring the in game faction was bogus (an insight Drew confirmed). You don’t need to have a real DW, it remains a fiction, an unknown.

We as Cmdrs were led to believe otherwise, through our manuals etc.. but not intentionally, simply due to an absence in information. However a ticket was raised on this subject, and it essentially confirms there is no test.

Personally I feel this indicates there is no DW. However, I presume the new data in the codex essentially affirms there is a DW station. My guess is it’s a dead station with voice logs….

The system’s identified regarding Onion head are actually very far removed from the general Underworld sector. I feel if this is relevant, more data is required.
If you read the codex para on Lyta Crane's comments dispassionately then enough doubt is thrown on them to make it unlikely (IMO) that TDW exists at all in-game.
