OK, pondered Paradise Lost over lunch. If Adam & Eve are the toast's vagabonds after their expulsion from Eden then perhaps they're yearning to get back to Eden or Paradise? ...
(musing: perhaps Raxxla a wormhole to transport you to Eden in Alpha Centauri ?? It is a long "personal journey"!)

And I read that in PL Satan considered anywhere without the grace of god to be Hell, so wondered if after the expulsion Adam & Eve are in Hell.. so went from Fall to Paradiso and then Hel.

Paradiso is just two stars, nothing to be found (though cannot check for "comets", but Hel is more interesting. Nothing found but there are plenty of unallocated bodyids!
