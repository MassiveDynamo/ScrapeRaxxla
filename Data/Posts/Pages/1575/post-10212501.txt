The Terra Mater system was permit-locked at launch but the permit-giving faction did give out the permit from systems they had a presence in.
I made it my business in 3301 to get all the permits I could and the Terra Mater permit was probably the hardest to get, as the anarchy faction that gave it out had only a small presence in one system at the time (during 1.3 iirc), so missions for them were scarce. It took me the better part of a week, playing more than I am able to these days.
Sounds a good candidate system then!
Permit locked from outset, logo/mythology/old mission description all fit, anarchy so might be described as a deadly secret (especially if carrying Trinkets, although strangely yesterday I was scanned several times but had no attacks or interdictions...the pirates were strangely quiet).
But if thatâ€™s the system, how to find the location within it?

Did have another thought yesterday so hared off to try a different system...
