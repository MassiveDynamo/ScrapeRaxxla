I thought I'd find the nearest systems within 100ly of Sol and look through them for Paradise Lost etc meaningful names.
I'm handicapped as Ive never read more than a few lines of Milton (poetry of any form is not my thing)... but I find I'm also handicapped because Spansh's Systems search option is coming back with a load of nonsense at the moment. Tried Inara but that doesnt go out beyond 20 ly & I cant see a filter value to change.
What are people using in the absence of EDDB?

edit
mmm, as a fallback I used the body search for any star within 103 ly which worked, but only found Fall after I reduced the solar mass filter from 1.0 to 0.5.
