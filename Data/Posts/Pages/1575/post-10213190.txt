I thought I'd find the nearest systems within 100ly of Sol and look through them for Paradise Lost etc meaningful names.
I'm handicapped as Ive never read more than a few lines of Milton (poetry of any form is not my thing)... but I find I'm also handicapped because Spansh's Systems search option is coming back with a load of nonsense at the moment. Tried Inara but that doesnt go out beyond 20 ly & I cant see a filter value to change.
What are people using in the absence of EDDB?

This has been something I’ve found difficult as well, as someone who has read Milton .

I had seen ‘Fall’ previously, but ignored it historically because I could not attribute a link, this is how I discovered the Underworld and Lost Realms, because I was looking for PL links…

I do presume there ought to be more in game… there is a weird balance in game, for instance, most of the Greek mythological systems all seem to sit tightly on one side of the ‘Yggdrasil tree’.

On the opposite side (Fall to Pandemonium) there seems to be a void! Maybe there are more PL systems in this area?



In PL Lucifer did traverse certain named locations - his journey is very well documented: firstly out of hell there was Sinn and Deaths Bridge / Viaduct; he then set foot on the outer sphere close to the Paradise of Vanity (limbo / paradise of fools); then the waters above / the Jasper Sea, then the Golden Stairs (chain).

Then the great opening between the spheres; then down through the stars and ‘other Eden’s’; down through the constellation Ophiuchus then setting foot on the surface of our sun; then to earth and a particular mountain., where he hid his spear!
