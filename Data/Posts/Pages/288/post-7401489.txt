To clarify and to keep this thread on topic: He meant contemporary to 1212, in context with his reply

Both, but neither make sense. If you equate it to modern times(3305=2019) there aren't many things that could fit in a straightforward sense. Muslim invasion could work because you could go with either some repeat of the crusades, or the whole who is controlling it paranoid theory going with the overwhelming conspiratorial realities of the game, or a statement about U.S. war efforts causing it. But, again the times don't make sense as the first thargoid invasion would have been in 1839 and not 1212(Which I mixed up initially.). The only other things that could make any sense would be that thargoids are some statement about U.S. miiltary presence or similar in a more general sense.(What else could even remotely be refered to as invading Britain/Europe in modern times?! Besides possibly Debt?). U.S. Military pressence wouldn't potentially make sense because I would assume Britain is the empire and the federation the U.S. Unless the three powers are something like England,France,Germany.(unless thargoids are some reference to U.S. helmets from wwI/II) After that it would have to be something like the invasion of Britain by something like the American crayfish. That might actually make sense. I don't know what else could fit a direct comparison to modern time in that theory. Else you have to take the route that the game represents things near the crusades or other times to other subjects which gets harder to figure out.

The point is if we could figure something like that out it might be much simpler to figure out what/where raxxla is. It would reduce a lot of possibilities as to everything in game and make it easier to locate. It would basically put an historical bullseye on it.

Edit: Except the problem with contemporary with 1212 is it goes back farther with the 800+ earlier period of raxxla. which means it can't be that simple. I don't think the crusades stretched that long did they? Or did they? I was hoping it would be easy to find something that represented galcop also but wasn't finding anything. Obviously if there is any historical correlation, thargoids are a big hint. It's too big of an event to avoid.

I guess you could back to the Romans. Maybe it's about the entirety of known British history?!

https://www.history.com/topics/middle-ages/crusades

I guess the crusades could work out if you were in that period. Since the first thargoid attack was about 200 years before the modern. But that means galcop was started about 800 years before. Would that be the end of the roman empire or similar?(byzantine?!) Not sure what that would make raxxla. Looking for the holy grail possibly? Lots of variation there and popular jokes from britain related to it in the form of montey python to start with.

What is popular historical reference/thinking/focus from a british standpoint?

Edit2: This idea started because of the reality of the current game time being 1:1 with real time and the fact the games lore emphasizes exact dates so heavily in so many areas. That would be a little bit obvious.

BTW, if thargoids equal invasion of britain by american crayfish, that would be hilarious. At which point does Gordon Ramsay show up and start commanding all humans to start eating thargoids?

I swear I saw an NPC that seemed way to close to gordon ramsay... He was a chef and everything!

Edit3: There is one other theory that fits all the major landmarks of modern history and that is catholacism vs protastantism and europes history. That would superficially fit names like, "The Club" of rome! But I don't see anything that fits napolean attacking rome.

Emperor Atticus Obellan Duval sends a second mission to the Exioce system to terraform the planet Experiment, putting an end Federal ambitions there.[URL="https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Elite_Dangerous_Timeline#cite_note-39"][40][/URL]

https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Elite_Dangerous_Timeline#3082

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_and_the_Catholic_Church

Then you are still stuck with what the thargoids correlate too.

https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/The_Club

I'm not sure who wrote what, but look at the key words and the descriptions. Sheparding, etc.

BTW, if the club is the club of rome then the club was founded in 1967 according to their website. That would be 3254. The club started project dynasty in 3270's. That kind of fits potentially. Or it's in the correct range of time.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_of_Rome
https://www.clubofrome.org/

Due to the machinations of The Club, however, the Alliance did not leverage FSD technology to gain superiority over the Federation and Empire; instead, the tech fell into the hands of Sirius Corporation, which monopolized it and revealed it to the public by 3290.[URL="https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/The_Club#cite_note-EDP-0"][1][/URL] FSDs were made widely available beginning in 3297, opening the floodgates for human exploration and expansion, and by 3300 all registered ships had been upgraded with this new technology.

3290 is only 2004... What came out that became popular by 2011?! The only thing I can think of is the internet, but I would put that farther back to the 90's and 80's. Unless it's refering to mass use. Who would sirius corp be then? Space exploration could mean the internet development or something. Or are there famous space adventures in those periods? That or when bigger internet connection occured. Is FSD just broadband?

What is creapy is if you look at the club of rome website. It has an add that says transformation is feasible. The major project of the club is terraforming!

https://www.clubofrome.org/2018/10/18/transformation-is-feasable-a-new-report-to-the-club-of-rome/

Something that fits 2004. It's not the foundation but the start of public trading of one thing related to the internet! GOOGLE!!

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google

They incorporated Google as a privately held company on September 4, 1998. An initial public offering (IPO) took place on August 19, 2004, and Google moved to its headquarters in Mountain View, California, nicknamed the Googleplex.

So, the question would then be that if they made it public(IPO's/trading) who is sirius corp and who owns google?! I thought it was odd marco qwent was a conveniently exiled worker/designer on a planet called lucifer... I think he's a bit on the suspicious side. It's like he's hiding he's a potential major player and underplaying himself incase anyone looks into it.

This would all mean that FSD equals internet or google usage/trading...

What are thargoids then. Hackers or something odd? But that gets to something interesting. First thargoid invasion is in the 1830's. That could mean something related to telegraph lines.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_transcontinental_telegraph

http://www.americaslibrary.gov/jb/reform/jb_reform_morsecod_1.html

Was there something before this that might relate(a pre telegraph tech that was a competitor/alternative or something?). Or would thargoids be something different altogether? I don't know what was famous in 1839... Let alone any take on the word invasion or war/conflict.

https://www.loc.gov/collections/samuel-morse-papers/articles-and-essays/timeline/1791-1839/

From his birth in 1791 to when he meets Louis Daguerre in Paris in 1839.

Daguerre I recognize as that is the system I keep my ships and buy all my stuff as it's in the control of the guy who gives 15% off of everything! 8)

Is Daguerreotype being used in some way in modern times famously? Maybe astronomy or something? IF thargoids are related to this photography method is could make sense out of it. Thargoids could represent the return of this process being used somehow. Is it needed for like deep space shots or something? Or is it being reused in some way in a new form in modern times.

Another odd link:

Project destiny starts in 3270=1984. The year the original game was released.

What is this? The internets war on kodak?!

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daguerreotype

First mention in print (1835) and public announcement (1839)

A paragraph tacked onto the end of a review of one of Daguerre's Diorama spectacles[URL="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daguerreotype#cite_note-42"][42][/URL] in the Journal des artistes on 27 September 1835,[URL="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daguerreotype#cite_note-43"][43][/URL] a Diorama painting of a landslide that occurred in "La Vallée de Goldau", made passing mention of rumour that was going around the Paris studios of Daguerre's attempts to make a visual record on metal plates of the fleeting image produced by the camera obscura:
It is said that Daguerre has found the means to collect, on a plate prepared by him, the image produced by the camera obscura, in such a way that a portrait, a landscape, or any view, projected upon this plate by the ordinary camera obscura, leaves an imprint in light and shade there, and thus presents the most perfect of all drawings ... a preparation put over this image preserves it for an indefinite time ... the physical sciences have perhaps never presented a marvel comparable to this one.[URL="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daguerreotype#cite_note-44"][44][/URL]


Title pages of Daguerre's 1839 manual, published soon after Arago's lecture to meet the intense public demand for more information about the process.


A further clue to fixing the date of invention of the process is that when the Paris correspondent of the London periodical reported the public announcement of the daguerreotype in 1839, he mentioned that the daguerreotypes now being produced were of considerably better quality than the ones he had seen "four years earlier".

-------------

Together, these announcements caused early commentators to choose 1839 as the year photography was born, or made public. Later, it became known that Niépce's role had been downplayed in Arago's efforts to publicize the daguerreotype, and the first photograph is recorded in Eder's as having been taken in 1826 or 1827. Niépce's reputation as the real inventor of photography became known through his son 's indignation that his father's early experiments had been overlooked or ignored although Nicéphore had revealed his process, which, at the time, was secret.

This could make sense of all the secrecy regarding thargoids in some ways.

"Yes. My name is Isidor Goldstein, I am a professor at the faculty of Anthropology in Federal University of Deciat. Specialising in alien species and currently working on projects involving both the Guardians and Thargoids".

Would this mean the fedration is somehow related to france or where these individual come from? The history of photography puts them in relationship to the Academy of science in france.

At a joint meeting of the French Academy of Sciences and the Académie des Beaux-Arts held at the Institut de Françe on Monday, 19 August 1839[URL="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daguerreotype#cite_note-45"][45][/URL][URL="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daguerreotype#cite_note-46"][46][/URL]François Arago briefly referred to the earlier process that Niépce had developed and Daguerre had helped to improve without mentioning them by name (the heliograph and the physautotype) in rather disparaging terms stressing their inconvenience and disadvantages such as that exposures were so long as eight hours that required a full day's exposure during which time the sun had moved across the sky removing all trace of halftones or modelling in round objects, and the photographic layer was apt to peel off in patches, while praising the daguerreotype in glowing terms. Overlooking Nicéphore Niépce's contribution in this way led Niépce's son, Isidore to resent his father being ignored as having been the first to capture the image produced in a camera by chemical means, and Isidore wrote a pamphlet in defence of his father's reputation Histoire de la decouverte improprement nommé daguerréotype[URL="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daguerreotype#cite_note-47"][47][/URL](History of the discovery improperly named the daguerreotype with a note on its real inventor Joseph Nicéphore Niépce[URL="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daguerreotype#cite_note-Isidore_Niépce_and_Daguerre-23"][23][/URL][URL="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daguerreotype#cite_note-48"][48][/URL]

Mind you I haven't played the games so I'm not familiar with much. It puts me at a disadvantage.

Are thargoids feminism?! ><

Thargoids are universally female.
Thargoids have been in space for ‘Millennia’.

Either way, what would raxxla be. It's over 800 years old isn't it?! When was the first known reference to raxxla again? I can't find the reference.

https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDange...can_we_start_a_raxxla_mega_conspiracy_thread/

The first known mention of Raxxla is from Art Tornqvist

https://www.iffs.se/en/research/researchers/maria-tornqvist/ 8\

When did the art tornqvist live in elite dangerous timeline?

Another idea is take the year equal to real time and then put everything together from that year like a bizzare mishmash of events.
