That Felicity quote in the codex is what lead me to believe they are the real Dark Wheel. They are operating for years now and even expanded to LFT 926. Dont you think the "real" DW would have intervened if the codex specificly says they dont tolerate if someone abuses their name?!

After i got allied i did missions for at least 30 hours for them but nothing out of the ordinary for now (i accept all follow up missions, donate if i can, check local news and greetings etc.).

For now i switched to getting all the permits i dont have.
