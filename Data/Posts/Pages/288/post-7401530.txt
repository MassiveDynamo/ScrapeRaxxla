People need to remove themselves from the "tiny bit obvious" quote. Watching the stream, he is clearly talking about the fact that it was a tiny bit obvious that a Raxxla question would be some of the first questions asked. He is not responding to the question itself when he says this, he is responding to the other guy when he says you can guess this would be a question asked to which he says "yeah its a tiny bit obvious" and then the other guy moves on to the next question. If you think it related to the question then this will lead you off track. Raxxla will be found but only but only to those who have the eyes to see it.

I keep forgetting that is where that idea came from. Yea, I don't think he meant raxxla at all but the question. But that gets confused over time. Although it works naturally as a general thought in regards to game design.
