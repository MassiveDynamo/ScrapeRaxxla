Unless the entirety of the dark wheel is like some inside joke on everyone by adventurers. Felicity farseer is an adventurer and it could all be them just messing with everyone for fun. It's not like there are no advantages for adventurers to make up stories and perpetuate them.

The entire raxxla thing is basically like a giant joke passed down by adventurers over the centuries. I wonder if Raxxla isn't just the first place found by adventurers headed out from sol. Or the first station made in the early days of spaceflight.
