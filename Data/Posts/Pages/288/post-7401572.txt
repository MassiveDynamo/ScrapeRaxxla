On the other hand, we don’t know what Raxxla is in ED, so we don’t know what capabilities it offers (if any) to anyone who can access it!

I suspect you are right in that the Club comprise a group of powerful characters that we hear of often in galnet articles and have no access to Raxxla, but we don’t have any canon source that says Raxxla is inhabited.

However I also think Raxxla is a hidden station that will turn out to have no special capabilities. It might be an alien construction, but I’m not expecting it to be end-game or a super SD.

Raxxla will turn out to be a tourist beacon
