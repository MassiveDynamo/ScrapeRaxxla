I don't think we can. There's no indications of The Club having anything akin to what Raxxla is rumoured to be. They're powerful individuals who are manipulating events from positions of influence, but they appear to be having to rely on that as opposed to having access to anything beyond the normal human means.

I've always viewed the people on Raxxla - the Elite Corp of Powerful, Twisted Men (& Women, etc.) - as a different group to The Club.

Always possible there's some crossover though. Exo would be a good candidate for one of the former who's also in the latter IMHO.

On the other hand, we don’t know what Raxxla is in ED, so we don’t know what capabilities it offers (if any) to anyone who can access it!

I suspect you are right in that the Club comprise a group of powerful characters that we hear of often in galnet articles and have no access to Raxxla, but we don’t have any canon source that says Raxxla is inhabited.

However I also think Raxxla is a hidden station that will turn out to have no special capabilities. It might be an alien construction, but I’m not expecting it to be end-game or a super SD.
