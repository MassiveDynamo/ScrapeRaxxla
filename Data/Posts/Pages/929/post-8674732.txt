No, not yet anyway in the vids Ive seen, he had the usual theory. Triple Elite and in the bubble but thats all I have so far plus his interpretation that it needed 3 things to get the solution: Knowledge of the Lore, the devs / Brookes & something else, its in the vid above but I cannot recall. He said when he got triple Elite he would go and the LS audience could join him but these vids are 4 years old and dunno when or if he ever did it.... I may have to start trawling vids again.

I'm curious as to what happened and where it was, what his theory actually was.
