Nah, I’m sure the quote was DB, not DW. There was a lot of debate on what it pertained to at the time. If it was DW we would have pretty much known it pertained to the FR mystery, and it would have been a FR mystery thread thing, but as I recall it, the discussion was on one of the Canonn megathreads. I’m also fairly sure it was reasonably close to the trailer that featured what we now think was a Thargoid Structure.

That would fit as it could actually have been the Thargoid Stuctures that we’re being referred to as they were apparently in game prior to the update where the listening points and installations which lead to their discovery got added to the Pleiades.

(If the forum search didn’t miss out large periods of time, I’d track it back that way! )

Might be worth a search through the old Canonn threads for any utterances by FDev & DB in particular, though at the moment I don’t recall anything. Was it in a Canonn thread, or was it in a livestream discussed in a Canonn thread? Don’t recall DB directly commenting much in any of the threads, it was always MB with cryptic comments (bless him)
