I can’t believe no one warned you that a major theme du jour on DD is looking up old videos and either:

- using them to jump to ridiculous conclusions about what’s going to / should be in Odyssey

And/or

- using them as a grounds for cries of ‘broken promises

(Occasionally they’re cited for more sensible reasons too like pointing out the nature of the long term pipeline, but I fear the more salty used are in the ascendancy! )

Ah, I’m not a big forum user, didn’t know. Perhaps a friendly Moderator could move it?

Edit: moved to Lore & Roleplay!
