Without going into too much detail to protect a confidential source but does this picture mean anything to anybody

I've found looking at the audio for to long, people, myself included would project a bit of themselves on the sound and spectrogram. If there isn't clearly something unusual about it I'd move on. You point out a better example of clearly something interesting in your video about Colonia and the LS Signal in the audio in Jacques station. If it is is a curious audio, catalog it, remain mindful of it but keep looking, and you may find something that makes it clearer, but that will never happen hyper focusing on only one method or sample.
