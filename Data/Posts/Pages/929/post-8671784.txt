17m in but main bit is at 18m 00s to 18m30s

Its another telling of the DB 'Its in the game' but a slightly different version to the other 3 we have on P1 with slightly different context. Edit also places it at the pre-launch or launch party meaning the very first version...

Edit edit: same vi. 22 mins an on - DW says DB alluded to lots of things in or around the bubble to be discovered. Talked about Gen ships implying none or not many of those found at the time so its way before people found a lot of stuff if DB did say that he hasnt said it recently unless anyone can source it? This vid is 4 years old.
