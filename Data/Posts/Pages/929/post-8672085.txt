FDev ED-relevant quotes/videos
Since much discussion is generated on the topic of DB said this, or MB said that, etc I posted my compilation of FDev source references on the Quest for Raxxla thread for others to use. It was suggested that it should be in its own thread for everyone to access & I’m happy to oblige. Please feel...

Nooooooooo!!!!

I can’t believe no one warned you that a major theme du jour on DD is looking up old videos and either:

- using them to jump to ridiculous conclusions about what’s going to / should be in Odyssey

And/or

- using them as a grounds for cries of ‘broken promises

(Occasionally they’re cited for more sensible reasons too like pointing out the nature of the long term pipeline, but I fear the more salty used are in the ascendancy! )
