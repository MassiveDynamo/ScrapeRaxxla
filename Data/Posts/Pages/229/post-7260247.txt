has anyone looked at the wave form of the witchspace sounds?

I think they've been looked at before, but maybe different regions look a bit different. If there were six equidistant systems from Zeta Cass, I'd say check the waveforms for witchspace between them all and maybe do some adding and subtracting of the combined waveforms.
