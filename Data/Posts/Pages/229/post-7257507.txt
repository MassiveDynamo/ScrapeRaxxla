I had an idea that Raxxla might be in the Virgo constellation for some reason (Virgo contains alot of galaxies = mother of galaxies, it is also Demeter and galaktikos is a milk, it is also Astraea - Atrophile, spiralling stars are galaxies too, also both Cora and Cynthia are Demeter's daughters, and Sideris is 'constellation'... And "place is not a place and door that also a key" might be place on the sky map (constelation), i.e. direction from Sol), so i went towards Auva (Virgo's omhalos) from Sol in supercuise. I did screenshots sometimes to compare them and see if anything changes. In about 0.3 l.y. new bright star appeared on the skybox. I have identifeied it as Shoujeman. Just wondering, i was thinking skybox renders when jumping into the system, so it is strange or it is just a bug). Just posting to share it Would be nice if anybody could make a screenshot of Virgo from Sol (plot course to Auva or Shoujeman and center it on the screen) to see if other people have Shoujeman on the skybox or not.
