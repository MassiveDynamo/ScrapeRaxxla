Have Dyson Spheres been considered in the enigma of Raxxla? It could be a way to hide a star or part of a solar system. I don't know if it could be made in the Cobra Engine. But perhaps a hole of entrance and exit in the sphere may be only visible from a certain angle of view (some selected stars, for example).

Edit: Yes, it's been said a dozen of times. Well, the debate may focus in if the Cobra Graphic engine can handle a Dyson Sphere.
