With all the talk of Astrophel and Stella I decided to cross reference those terms against Noyle's Watchers of the Sky. No hits for Astrophel but Stella gets mentioned by Tycho Brahe in relation to his publication of De Nova Stella. We often talk about Cassiopeia A and its exclusion from the Galaxy but the other half of The Cassiopeia Project was the search for Tycho G, the white dwarf that was ejected from the supernova that Brahe described in his De Nova Stella.

... I never did go looking for 3C10 itself. Just the ejected companion.

But those are thoughts for another time.

The meat of this post is that, in the Codex, the part of the title that is changed is "Stella" indicating that perhaps it is there, in this word alone, where the hint lies and not inside the text of the poem at all. And if this hint were to point us in the direction of Brahe's De Nova Stella then perhaps we might want to look in the direction of the Tycho system out toward Barnard's Loop. Does anyone, by the way, have a list of the named systems out there? I'd be interested in seeing if they correspond to the astronomers listed in Noyle's poem.

It seems odd that there are named systems all the way out toward Barnard's Loop but a possible lore explanation could be that these systems were visited fairly early on during mankind's exploration of the galaxy. While certainly not "in the Bubble" Barnard's Loop is not so very far away as to exclude it from having been reached by pre-FSD FTL stardrives.
