Yes, I also was thinking about this. I don't believe Frontier would hide some content behind poems or sonnets and making it only accessible to a subgroup of players which have a decent knowledge of the English language. I think if Fontier decides that it's time to find Raxxla, the clues will be much simpler and easier to follow...

If only this were true and I honestly hope you're right. I'm a romantic so forgive me for emphasis on hidden messages written in the stars. My guess work is based only off FD past examples of seeding mystery - galnet and encryption.

Listening to the Dark Wheel audio it seems there could be a 'path' for Elites. Hit Elite and answer some anonymous mission, pass the test and get an invite. ..but that could lead us to just the DW station. But wouldn't it be cool if that held extra clues....maybe the toast is not a path to Raxxla but to the DW station?

Then again the Raxxla codex could be as much about the location of the Dark Wheel Station than Raxxla itself?

Its the journey that enthrals not the destination.
