OK do bare with me - we've been drinking.

Fever dream last night...dreamt of various factions, then the gaps between them, it created a network. The network of unpopulated areas which had concentrations. One of them had six spokes...

This came I realise as a reverse of what we do at work. We gather intelligence on nominals; their personal details, locality and connections with others. This is used to identify spacial relationships and focus resources. Its called ERD - Entity relationship modelling.

I know we have very little hard evidence regards Raxxla but I suppose what I'm trying to get at is, if we took all the known data we do have on the activity surrounding the old Dark Wheel missions and join the dots in a spacial ERD what will we get?

Honestly I think it would just be chaos as probably random, which is why I won't tackle it...that and the time commitment.

Then again some ERDs show voids where intelligence is missing....this sometimes is as powerful as solid intel...it can show operational thinking or where resources should be focused.

OK the baco-foil just ran out...back to reality. I'm going to check down the back of the sofa again that's normally where things turn up.
