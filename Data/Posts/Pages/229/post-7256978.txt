Its the journey that enthrals not the destination.

Regarding the final destination. What started me on the entire Cygnus path was the system Cygni X-3.

It is by far the 'highest' system in ED, viewed from Earth. It's probably thousands of LY, from the closest reachable star.
It consists of two black holes and a B0 variable(in ED).
In RL it's a micro quasar. One of, if not the most radiant object in the Milky Way.

I just thought i fit well with the black, radiant eyes of Stella, in the Poem.
