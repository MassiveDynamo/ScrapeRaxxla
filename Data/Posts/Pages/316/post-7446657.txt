It doesn’t have to be directly involved with the codex. It might be sharing a mutual reference indirectly.


That was exactly what I felt when I first saw it. And it was completaly by a chance.

Same. I didn’t know about it until I got closer, I had assumed it was one of the skybox decorations we see. Hadn’t it been so close to my original destination I wouldn’t have hesitated to divert to it first. Once you see it and realize you can go there, you gotta go.
