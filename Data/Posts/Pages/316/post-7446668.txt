Here's Obsidian Ant's post of 2015, so others can see what we're referring to. I've always noticed that region and thought it a bit odd looking as there are so many bright stars all in a line. Kept meaning to go have a look, and I'm not _very_ far away at them moment. Maybe I'll swing by for the hell of it.

where did that come from? Search for the term and only ED stuff comes up - who added that to EDSM? Is there an out of game reference for that name?

Can’t find a irl reference to it like that. Seems to be something that exists in game only. There doesn’t appear to be any real work mythology attached to it. The only things mentioned in NASA, Earth and Sky, Wiki etc is its exceptional luminosity, and that it illuminates the famed Pillars of Creation.

The fact (near as I can tell) to it being a Siren of the Spinward Stars exists in game only makes it all the more intriguing.
If the reference predates the updates, good. Would even be better if the reference was added with the launch of 3.3 like the renaming of Delphi.
