Can’t find a irl reference to it like that. Seems to be something that exists in game only. There doesn’t appear to be any real work mythology attached to it. The only things mentioned in NASA, Earth and Sky, Wiki etc is its exceptional luminosity, and that it illuminates the famed Pillars of Creation.

The fact (near as I can tell) to it being a Siren of the Spinward Stars exists in game only makes it all the more intriguing.
If the reference predates the updates, good. Would even be better if the reference was added with the launch of 3.3 like the renaming of Delphi.

The name is just in EDSM, I think. Probably a name given to it by the galactic maping project community.

FD has picked up a few of those names and added it to the game, after a while. Conflux and Hawkins gap are examples.
