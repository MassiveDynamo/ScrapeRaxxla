According to edsm, NGC7822 is known as The Siren of the Spinward Stars. Been through every Class O in it. Mapped quite a few. S171 9 is my favorite system of them. It has 3 black holes. Just favorite for beauty, not due to anything riddle related. S171 34 has the Cupids Arrow tourist beacon. That was the 2nd step in our process. "Ours" being the 46&2.

Making my way though the systems now, currently docked at the little asteroid base in a class M near the edge of the Nebula. But, as predicted, after leaving Andromedae and arriving at my first destination I’m greeted with “First mapped by Guru-951” damnit!!! Lol. Seriously a Bad Wolf thing goin on there lol.
