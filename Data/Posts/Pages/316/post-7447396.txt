Then did anyone realize the death star is in it's first stages! Raxxla means nothing if the blow up all our planets!!! (Do they kill on site near a death star construction?) It looks like a lobster claw aiming at something.

It's a PMF.

Is it possible the would use a PMF as a front. Maybe the connect to something like a fake front for the DW. How much do the incorporate players actions into the lore?



What if Raxxla was blown up... We could be looking for a debri field or asteroid belt..
