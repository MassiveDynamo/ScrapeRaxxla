Then did anyone realize the death star is in it's first stages! Raxxla means nothing if the blow up all our planets!!! (Do they kill on site near a death star construction?) It looks like a lobster claw aiming at something.

What if Raxxla was blown up... We could be looking for a debri field or asteroid belt..
