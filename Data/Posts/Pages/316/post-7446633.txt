Since when has there been an asteroid base at each nebula? Even the rosette nebula which is 8kly from sol has one.

'Checking in' to the N/America nebula base was greeted as if it was a travelodge with 'Enjoy your stay, I hope all is to your liking' - I nearly asked where the mini-bar is

Yeah there have been a number added over time for sure. Havenâ€™t been to the one in the NA Neb myself but interesting to hear there is one. I think the one in this Neb was added after the CG in California Sector BV-Y C7 (Darwin Research) because they determined the Nebula was of scientific importance.
