not sure of the source. IMO, the source is irrelevant, as long as it was a thing Before the Riddle was given to us. As they may have used it based on it being a thing already.

It doesnâ€™t have to be directly involved with the codex. It might be sharing a mutual reference indirectly.

Sometimes referred to as the 'Siren of the Spinward Stars'. So called because pilots see them from hundreds of light years away, look on in wonder, and feel an urge get closer to investigate.
That was exactly what I felt when I first saw it. And it was completaly by a chance.
