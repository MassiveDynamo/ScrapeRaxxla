For the record though, the Andromeda constellation is so large that it reaches to the furthest point on the edge of the galaxy in the direction of the Andromeda galaxy itself.
I've been to all but that 1 star on the edge, which according to EDSM has been visited hundreds of times and has only 2 stars. I believe CMDR Baton was the first visitor to it.
