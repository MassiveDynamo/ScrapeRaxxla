Not sure if anyone mentioned it yet in this thread since Odyssey release, but... I was wondering if they maybe sneakily put in a tease about that mysterious Dark Wheel Station out there, in plain sight, just to be skipped over by most. It is there for a very brief moment right before you get to the menu screen. Does anyone know what place and station this shows? If it is a popular known place, then disregard this post, but if it is not... maybe that is what we are looking for? Station is one of the old designs, the moon the SRV is standing on also looks interesting with that other celestial body very close to it, and the station could be considered pretty well hidden between them. Anyways, food for thought

Yes, I hypothesised this a couple of years ago. I did try to pattern match the stars but failed. However I think the perspective is distorted, two moons should not be that close together. It may be from game, or it may just be allegorical.
