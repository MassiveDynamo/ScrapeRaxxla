Thanks So it seems jury is still out on the significance (or lack thereof) of that brief starting screen. Personally I think it has some significance, because why put it there and just pick some random view. Also that particular view it shows seems very unique, with the other planet or moon so close to the one the SRV is standing on. Also nice demonstration of the new planetary tech for surfaces. Seems to be one of the new atmospheric ones too. It does not match the codex image for the Dark Wheel station though. And the star seems very bright, and more distant, so it probably is not the same as shown in the codex entry. Well... the hunt continues! ^^

Ya the start screen was initially a coriolis station i think(?)... getting fuzzy .... then with horizons we got the buggy and the orbis station(?) - Then later we got the ship in the hanger and now of course the fancy cinematic.... speaking of which - frontier does put their logo over that moon in the sky...
