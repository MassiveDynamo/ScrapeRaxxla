they missed a trick there didn't they, if they'd said Odyssey problems were mainly because they'd updated Raxxla everyone would be a lot quieter

Hmmmmm... How are fleet carriers shown in game? like system elements that jump to other systems... Possibly how a "rouge" moon would move from system to system. Maybe they used the Raxxla mechanic to get fleet carriers to work and now RAXXLA IS ANGRY !
