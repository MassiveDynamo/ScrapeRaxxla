I too spent ages matching the start screen's stars - its basically not possible that it is anywhere near to Sol. It could be somewhere far from Sol, ofc.

The images are either highly contrived or else its taken with a very narrow field of view as the moon looks very compressed.

When the Engineers update came out, we got the hangar view, and the codex, and my assumption was that FD were saying - 'its not in those images - look elsewhere', but who knows. In my fantasies, FD regularly review and take notice of this thread....
