Ya the start screen was initially a coriolis station i think(?)... getting fuzzy .... then with horizons we got the buggy and the orbis station(?) - Then later we got the ship in the hanger and now of course the fancy cinematic.... speaking of which - frontier does put their logo over that moon in the sky...
The start screen for baseline ED showed a Coriolis, then Horizons came in and it changed to an Orbis. Which detracts from this being meaningful - TDW station has never been a Coriolis. This pic has been in-game since the introduction of Horizons, its nit the new planetary tech. And the star seems to be an A or B type, whereas the TDW logo in the Codex shows an M subdwarf (M VI) after the colour balance has been corrected-I’ve posted that in this thread.

There is another start screen which shows a zoom into a mix of views of the Magellanic clouds, blue and red dust clouds, Barnard’s Loop and the Witchhead neb, then the PF Griffin appears and seems to highlight one star. Spent ages trying to track that down too. The thing that made me suspicious was that BLoop and Witchhead are masked by the dust cloud and difficult to make out-why?

As far as Raxxla is concerned I still suspect the apparently green star being highlighted during the Guardians teaser vid. Though that might be more related to the Guardians storyline I’ve long thought that Raxxla is likely to be one of the Guardian Ark Ships.
