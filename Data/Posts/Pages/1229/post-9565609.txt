So what im hearing is that we are coming through the Raxxla Gate (starter systems) into the elite universe roughly every 50 years and taking over the lives of pilots federation members (who were possibly bred and supplied with implants to facilitate this). We are the twisted men (AI ?) of Raxxla who are shaping the path of humanity… ?
Nah, the twisted men of Raxxla have already found the dam thing!!!

I think we’re either the ill-fated red shirts, or maybe the plucky comic relief
(I think FD must find our hypothesising and puerile attempts to find Raxxla immensely amusing! I suspect they have regular casualties due to episodes of hysterical laughter while intaking pizza & beer, which is why it’s taking so long to sort EDO. Perhaps while we’re talking about Intel analysis we should examine the public health records for Cambridge?)

P.S. clearly all those with single name avatars aren't important enough for a last name, because they’re gonna die five minutes in!
