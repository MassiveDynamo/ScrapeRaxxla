I think 50 years is just an acknowledgement of the start year of the games. With the exception of Elite (3125), the rest are at 50 year intervals (FE2 3200, FFE 3250, ED 3300).
Raxxla rumours peak when there are players in the Elite galaxy.
So what im hearing is that we are coming through the Raxxla Gate (starter systems) into the elite universe roughly every 50 years and taking over the lives of pilots federation members (who were possibly bred and supplied with implants to facilitate this). We are the twisted men (AI ?) of Raxxla who are shaping the path of humanityâ€¦ ?
