So bit of spare time on my hands, decided to try my luck again with customer support.

I continued on from my previous enquiry but expanded it to include the codex, essentially asking if said assets Dark Wheel or Raxxla were actual and could be interacted with, based upon their advertisement in the Codex.

Just to test if FD have changed their policy concerning such discussion, especially in light of my recent confirmation from them that the Polaris permit was not currently accessible.

“In regards to the those elements you've mentioned, I'm afraid we have no additional information to provide from here at Customer Support; whilst here we can assist with technical or account issues, we leave such discovery to the adventurous endeavors of our esteemed Commanders and intrepid explorers!”

So it’s a non-confirmation again, however my initial question was to assess if advertised assets were ‘accessible’ note how this has not been denied.

Albeit their get-out is that they have no information to supply, a non confirmation is as good as a confirmation in my book.

So no real headway there but it was worth a shot, it’s open to interpretation if this is affirmation the Dark Wheel and Raxxla are currently discoverable.

Being in a positive frame of mind I might take this as a confirmation they are…
