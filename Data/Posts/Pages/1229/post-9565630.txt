So what im hearing is that we are coming through the Raxxla Gate (starter systems) into the elite universe roughly every 50 years and taking over the lives of pilots federation members (who were possibly bred and supplied with implants to facilitate this). We are the twisted men (AI ?) of Raxxla who are shaping the path of humanityâ€¦ ?
That's how most people think RL works. You get stuffed in a random new body, each time the old one dies.
