I think I was the first to postulate Chiron in Sol as a possibility, based on John Harper’s statement about Raxxla rumours peaking every 50 years (I have found an alternative possibility which I’m exploring, when I can get in-game!). If you know the in-game star date applicable to Sol’s planets then you could get Chiron’s position from Stellarium. Unfortunately Sol’s planetary positions dont seem to match up for either 2021 or 3307, and FD have repeatedly failed to answer questions about what that date is, which I find highly suggestive!!

You might want to play around with Stellarium and see if you can match the in-game planetary positions to a date (we’d like to know it!!) and then go from there. Good hunting!
I think 50 years is just an acknowledgement of the start year of the games. With the exception of Elite (3125), the rest are at 50 year intervals (FE2 3200, FFE 3250, ED 3300).
Raxxla rumours peak when there are players in the Elite galaxy.
