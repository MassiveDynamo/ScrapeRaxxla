I wonder if commander braben is on EDSM... Looking through his travels would be interesting... You'd have to go and have a look wouldn't you? At least once...lol
Did you check?
I bet if he uses EDSM his flight log is private!
And he probably logs in as Alex Ryder to access Raxxla...letâ€™s hope he does so every month to ensure no bugs are preventing access!!!
