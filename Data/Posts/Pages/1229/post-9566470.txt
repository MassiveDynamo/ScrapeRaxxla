Oh, I don't mind old sales talk failing to appear- no problem at all, I fully understand they're under commercial and game development priorities/restrictions.
But I think the SD permit is the EPF membership, and it can't really be said to be a secret organisation with the invitation restricted by reputation; rep plays no part in the SD permit. So what was he talking about?
PF is secretive, but we're inducted when we get the first Sidey so no membership test (npc are apparently not members, go figure!), so cant be that.
TDW as described in the Codex meets the spec, but it appears nobody has ever achieved membership.

I'd like to have it confirmed that
a) TDW as a secret society that we can join is in-game
b) that membership invitation test is regularly tested, because we have had plenty of bugs that have prevented storyline events until the community pointed them out. Hyford's Cache perhaps being the most recent.

Note: I'm not asking HOW to gain membership, just asking whether it's worth my time continuing to play (in some physical discomfort mind!) to solve a puzzle that the Chief Dev has said (and the in-game Codex supports) is in -game, but which experience suggests is not !
