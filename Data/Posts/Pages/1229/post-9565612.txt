Raxxla is a key to the permit locked systems.... you should come on over.... there's no gankers and onionhead is free..... Yorkshire tea is not a rare commodity for Jorki too....

I'll send you all the Omphalos/Martian artefact so you can find you way... just honk when you arrive and I'll let you in, but don't be playing that knock knock ginger game like the first chap did... honked and ran!

Sorry got to go and play beach volleyball with the Ryders and the Dark Wheel.... now where did I leave that bloody alien stone thingy.... bloody lost it again..... ;-)
Yorkshire tea? Ugh, Iâ€™m no tea drinker!
But it had better have loads of freshly ground black coffee (medium roast) and lavian brandy on tap!!
And Parkin, to have with the brandy
And Wensleydale cheese
And Yorkshire curd tarts, yum, not had those in over 40 years
And fishnchips .........
