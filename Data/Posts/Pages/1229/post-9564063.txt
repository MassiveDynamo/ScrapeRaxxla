Is there someone that have found a NPC character with a familyname of Ryder?
I only found one engineer and the player faction (Ryders of the void)
But my guess is that this is important.. could you all search your game logfiles which system Ryder family exists
Found a pirate with the name Tom Ryder in Vaccae. But I dont know if the name Vaccae means something...
