Your correct, in hindsight I ought have worded it differently omitting Raxxla and focused on the dark Wheel, but I thought whatever…

I was a little taken aback by their admission concerning Polaris, so I wondered if there was a new policy in place; plus I was using a loaded question focused on advertised game elements being in place and ‘actionable’, eg they’re not just place holders like Polaris.

It was a wild shot in the dark but I thought it worked once why not twice?

I think a lot of what Braben said was corporate generic talk, not wanting to confirm himself to specifics, in hindsight at the time he was selling a product.

Everything he said could be attributed to various in game attributes, such as progress through the Elite ranks, or permit locks, again it’s word play and some of what he wanted to be in the game never came to pass.

I agree the so called invite has never occurred, but maybe it did, but just got moved..

My running theory is that it was the Elite permit to SD Founders Planet; from there the older Dark Wheel missions.

Drew commented on this forum that yes the DW faction were circa 2017 a front, so maybe those missions for the data spheres where said test…

Since the lore purge of 2017 I suspect those missions were bugged, and moved elsewhere, to where no one truly knows.

Questioning FD about those missions ‘again’ might be useful. Not in an ‘we’re after clues’ but more of a ‘you sold us a product (missions) it was broken - have you fixed it’ etc.
