Raxxla is a key to the permit locked systems.... you should come on over.... there's no gankers and onionhead is free..... Yorkshire tea is not a rare commodity for Jorki too....

I'll send you all the Omphalos/Martian artefact so you can find you way... just honk when you arrive and I'll let you in, but don't be playing that knock knock ginger game like the first chap did... honked and ran!

Sorry got to go and play beach volleyball with the Ryders and the Dark Wheel.... now where did I leave that bloody alien stone thingy.... bloody lost it again..... ;-)
