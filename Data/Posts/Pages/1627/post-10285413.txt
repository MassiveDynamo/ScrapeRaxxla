Well, to explore a fairly explicit PKD reference I've just travelled out from Sirius towards Sol until I hit 2001c and then some, but no new contacts or gravity wells presented themselves. Not that I expected anything but I was relatively certain noone else would have done it, at least not for the same reason.
I've travelled over 24 hrs trying to get from one system to another (Kaupolock to LFT509 - and took a Cobra MKIII just in case) and nothing really happened having honked quite a few times and received the same result as back at the main star

Whilst Sirius to Sol might have had some significance... I can concur my experiment showed no changes at any point and of course I couldn't enter the system but had to check and rule it out... The silly things we do....LOL

1. 12:00 - As you get very close to the system in super cruise, the system marker starts to jump around.
2. 16:19 - You still can't jump to the system when you are on top of it! (No surprise!)
3. 16:30 - When you drop in as close as you can and boost to the System marker continues to jump around.
4. 17:26 - When you drop down from super-cruise roughly 6LY from the nearest station you don't expect a Federal Security ship to drop in and scan you before high-waking (He went to Manguts - Yes I thought about jumping after him and losing the 24 hours of flight time getting to this point and had it said LFT 509, I would have of course tried jumping!)
5. 29:50 - "Honking" shows the same 23 bodies as it it does everywhere else in the system (Up to 5.98LY - can't vouch for further!)
6. 30:05 - The system map and galaxy map don't take account of you having moved to the location of the next star system.
