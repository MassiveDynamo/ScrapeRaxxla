I was thinking yesterday about Erebus being an interesting location bordering the region of storms (? iirc) but when I went there it only had five stars in the system and nothing else. Then I noticed in the Galaxy Map search that Erebus was also a moon in the Talhuacan system. Looking around for other interesting systems near there I noticed Thanatos, which has an Earth-like World called The Land with a moon called Kamet. A space station called Amylyn's Rest orbits The Land and Condit's Legacy orbits Kamet.

Again I was left asking why some systems with significant names (not least Axis Mundi but very many others) are empty systems but others have worlds and stations with interesting names. I feel that there is a significance to this - especially how mountains seem to be landable bodies. I feel that I am missing a clue here.

Now today we have an event in the Calhuacan system. (It begins there, at Angel Station where you dock to get a clue, and there is an adjacent listening post with encrypted messages). Could this be another hint that Erebus is significant?
