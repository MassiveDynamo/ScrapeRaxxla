This is the problem, how much of this was / is intended to be literal, or indirectly alluded?

Going way back, before we had all of our updated equipment, exploration was more demanding, and fun. What was there, apart from a permit to restrict our chances of finding Raxxla, given the assumption it was ‘just’ out there (although I might assume originally it was gated narratively). Except the long drawn out darkness of manual exploration.

Given this I think (if not part of some now redundant architecture), such systems were established as environmental storytelling, way markers; intended to guide our curiosity - given probably, in the past along side some clue or three…

Back then it probably was (and now) easier to hide it because it took time to scan an entire system, and remember, Gen Ships weren’t really found until FD gave us a proper nudge, I bet we sailed past those lots of times, very likely just the same with Raxxla.

Me thinks some of these current events are not intended to directly hold our hands and point the way, more so just gently nudge us, and try and make us aware that collectively these locations might have some unknown meaning and for us to start asking questions, like we are doing now.

If it’s more obvious, then we’re overthinking it. But then again we’ve all been overthinking this for a very long time…

The gardens idea is a very old concept too, we’ve been there before, but I never before thought of the Miltonian / Holdstock model… I think the puzzle is ‘unintentionally’ complex because it is historically archaeological.
