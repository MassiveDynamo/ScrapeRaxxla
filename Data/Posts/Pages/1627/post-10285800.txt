hmm, very strange, wish I wasn't out on the other side of the galaxy XD

my brain wants to ask a stupid question... did anyone ever use that galmap search trick, while it was working, on this system? maybe they are comets? and this is just the first time we've found a visual bug thats depicting them in some way?
if not comets, I'm at a loss.... no way to find them in the system? only on the SysMap?
or are these pics from in SC/normal space flight? if they're visual disturbances in system, and not comets, speechless I am XD
really wish I was closer, I'd boot up my desktop and 4k monitors and check er out...
Don't look like comets....
