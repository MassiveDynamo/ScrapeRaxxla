Well, to explore a fairly explicit PKD reference I've just travelled out from Sirius towards Sol until I hit 2001c and then some, but no new contacts or gravity wells presented themselves. Not that I expected anything but I was relatively certain noone else would have done it, at least not for the same reason.
