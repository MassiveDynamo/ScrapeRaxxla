@drew I know you're retired (maybe too tired?!), but I'm hoping you might consider my Christmas wish question, if you'd be so kind?

John Harper said that the 'geography' of the systems he used in AHTW were given to him by FDev. I was wondering... did you choose where the Formidine Rift was located, or did you propose your 'mystery adventure' to Fdev and they gave you the location which you then worked out in the detail as we now see it?

If you get my Christmas wish Drew, thanks!!
