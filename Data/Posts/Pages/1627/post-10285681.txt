Search for Volkov and there is another golden chain (Started to visit each one and got a little bored / distracted - must go back at some point)...

Well you could search for "2MASS J03291977+3124572" next door which is populated but Volkov is probably easier to type!

There are a few names in this one too... (Most results below are direct from Google Bard and not verified!!!!)

That golden chain in particular is the NGC 1333 star cluster.
(also, some ball-dropping happened with 2MASS J03291977+3124572 as it's present in the Hipparcos catalogue as HIP 16243 yet GalMap does not list it as such)

The H1 beacon in the Hesperus hunt pointed towards it, leading to H2 in the nearby Perseus Dark Region: https://canonn.science/codex/hesperus/
