Sooo.. .. I actually arrived here Tuesday, and spent yesterday in
BYOI AUSCS JR-A C15-0 <- ESDM link
Jump Range isn't usually an issue really for me, my Exlor-Aconda can do 65.2ly standard jump.

Full System Scan Complete,
Detailed Surface Scan of every body,
and First Footfall Confirmed on all Landable bodies.

And so far, it's a relatively unremarkable system.
Absolutely no biological sources, even with 25 body's, which is kind of interesting in itself.
Several geological sites, mostly Fumaroles.
Some very beautiful views of some deep craters and tall rocky spires... but nothing that doesn't exist elsewhere really....

Got into BYOI AUSCS BA-P D6-7 yesterday.

Again, mostly unremarkable . Only 8 bodies this time, but again, zero biologicals. nothing new.
flew out to about 2.5million LS towards the other system, nothing happened. No drops, game crashes, gravity wells, nothing.

havnt uploaded my logs to EDSM yet, but I will.

I jumped back to the first system before logging out, going to again try the flight out too 1 ly maybe this time, and see if I get the drops again, in which case that would be strange because I didn't drop once in the second system out to 2.5m LS, but I did twice in the first at under 1 million LS.

just need to confirm or discount if that behavior is replicated again, then I'm probably going to continue my trek to Beagle Point, I still want to get there, kind of need too now to repair up fully and replace my lost SRV, XD then the trek back to the bubble with a side stop near Sag A* to investigate some stuff in that area.... long road ahead
