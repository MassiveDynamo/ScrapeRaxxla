from DW Codex:
According to accepted spacer lore, membership in the Dark Wheel is by invitation only, and only the most exceptional pilots of each generation ever receive them.
i cant think of anything more "Exceptional" for the dark wheel, other than finding Raxxla. it could be that Raxxla isn't the final goal, only the key, to becoming an official member of the dark wheel.
wich could unlock new game mechanics as a member of the DW. (maybe?)
or add the DW as a faction in Power Play Only Visible for the Member. and Can therefore interract with Power Play Mechanics(Maybe?)
