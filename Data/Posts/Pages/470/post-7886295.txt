And no one has yet to even discover the Dark Wheel station. I think that is also in the game and will be found first. (I assume that Raxxla is hidden even better.)
There is a lot of talk about DW u locking Raxxla but I've been thinking about this and I actually wonder if finding Raxxla gets you a permit to the DW station
