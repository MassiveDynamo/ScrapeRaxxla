And no one has yet to even discover the Dark Wheel station. I think that is also in the game and will be found first. (I assume that Raxxla is hidden even better.)
Which leads to the question: do we have to find The Dark Wheel first, in order to find Raxxla later ?
Answering to that would point to where the effort should be aimed.
It may be the reason why FDevs put that clue about 8th moon in the Codex. To make us look for TDW first.
What interest could there be in finding that station other than to help in the Raxxla Quest ? New tech? TDW Pure Malt rare? To resurrect Salom√© The Witch ?
