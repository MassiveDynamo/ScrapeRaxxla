Maybe you have to get "conscious, cognizant, mindful" of the whole MW.. , meaning discover one specimen of every single body, phenomenon, type of star, planet, and so on, and visit every region..Then, when you have completed your personal journey and achieved that "mental representation" of the MW, (insight ?) you'll see in the skybox, shining brightly through the deep black...
The Door.
SPOILER
(LoL !)
The Codex works this way. Complete the whole discoveries part of the Codex in every region of the MW !
