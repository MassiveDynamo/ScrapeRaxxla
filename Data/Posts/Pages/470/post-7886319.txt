the concept of "a door that is also a key" is familiar to me, and is present in many cultures throughout time, including budhism.

in budhism, the budhist seeks enlightenment. he is a key. and he seeks a door. the mistake that he makes during his journey, is that he assumes that the sought door must be something other than himself, something different, but there is no outside door. what the budhist trully seeks is himself. his true self. he is the key and the door. in other words, the seeker and the sought are one and the same. they cant seek each other.

how could this apply to Raxxla?
Very interesting post and question, so here's a left field answer:
Raxxla the door and the key is two cubes that make a tesseract. (Yes, I'm still thinking like this and the description seems to support rather than refute a tesseract hypothesis).

The Door could be a cube that you can fly through to another cube, if you can activate it, thus it is also a key, or one cube might be considered the Door and the other the Key (being connected, they are a single object, making it both door and key, so each cube could be considered door or key interchangeably). Alternatively, the Key could be a cube-shaped object small enough to carry in cargo, maybe smaller (I wouldn't rule out the Martian Relic). If activated, it transports you back inside the partner cube (although you would possibly find it difficult to get back home from there, this is not inconsistent with the apparent history).
