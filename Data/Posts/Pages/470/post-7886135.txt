You could argue that all stars in milky way spiral around Sag A. Sag a is also sometimes described as the mother of the galaxy. It is on my hit list to pop up there (NOT in my Beluga!) and see if anything can be done with lensing effect, as has been tried previously with Maia, to try to find a jewl that burns bright on its brow
a shimmering, silver disc, a double spiral of tiny bright points. It slowly turns: it's a galaxy in miniature, with the same intense blur of light at its centre......
