Two things: if it was "near, or in the bubble" I'm at a loss to explain how it hasn't been found yet. We're going on five years now and it's baffling to me that people wouldn't have found it...that is if it is conventionally able to be found and not a "ghost planet" like you mention that doesn't appear on normal system scans or FSS. The Bubble, I think, is well and truly worked over and the cloud around it is pretty well explored out to around 1.5kly's in all directions, more so in some directions, less in others.

Also, the "8th moon of a gas giant" is the Dark Wheel's station, not Raxxla.
I do agree with this, but IF Raxxla isnt a planet, that may explain why we haven't found it. Even if it is a planet, there are lots of uninteresting ice planets, etc in and around the bubble that have not been mapped. Especially those a long way from arrival point.
