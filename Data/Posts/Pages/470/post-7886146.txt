Me too. My personal belief is that it's in-game, near, or in the bubble.

I think that it's on the "8th moon of a gas giant", but that the gas giant and/or moons are not shown on a scan.
Two things: if it was "near, or in the bubble" I'm at a loss to explain how it hasn't been found yet. We're going on five years now and it's baffling to me that people wouldn't have found it...that is if it is conventionally able to be found and not a "ghost planet" like you mention that doesn't appear on normal system scans or FSS. The Bubble, I think, is well and truly worked over and the cloud around it is pretty well explored out to around 1.5kly's in all directions, more so in some directions, less in others.

Also, the "8th moon of a gas giant" is the Dark Wheel's station, not Raxxla.
