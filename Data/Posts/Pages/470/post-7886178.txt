Two things: if it was "near, or in the bubble" I'm at a loss to explain how it hasn't been found yet. We're going on five years now and it's baffling to me that people wouldn't have found it...that is if it is conventionally able to be found and not a "ghost planet" like you mention that doesn't appear on normal system scans or FSS. The Bubble, I think, is well and truly worked over and the cloud around it is pretty well explored out to around 1.5kly's in all directions, more so in some directions, less in others.

Also, the "8th moon of a gas giant" is the Dark Wheel's station, not Raxxla.
Think of the lost colony ships. My understanding is that those were always in the game (starting out as Anaconda placeholder ships) and were only found once there were some clues.

Yes, but there's been a lot less exploration past 1500kls (within each system). Space is big, even within the bubble. I think it's entirely possible that it's been overlooked.

I thought the Dark Wheel station was supposed to be "near" Raxxla. I'm no expert, but these stories are from when faster than light travel was arduous. That's why I think it's hiding "under our noses".
