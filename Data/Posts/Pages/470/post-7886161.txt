the concept of "a door that is also a key" is familiar to me, and is present in many cultures throughout time, including budhism.

in budhism, the budhist seeks enlightenment. he is a key. and he seeks a door. the mistake that he makes during his journey, is that he assumes that the sought door must be something other than himself, something different, but there is no outside door. what the budhist trully seeks is himself. his true self. he is the key and the door. in other words, the seeker and the sought are one and the same. they cant seek each other.

how could this apply to Raxxla?
