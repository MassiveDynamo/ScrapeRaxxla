Think of the lost colony ships. My understanding is that those were always in the game (starting out as Anaconda placeholder ships) and were only found once there were some clues.

Yes, but there's been a lot less exploration past 1500klys. Space is big, even within the bubble. I think it's entirely possible that it's been overlooked.

I thought the Dark Wheel station was supposed to be "near" Raxxla. I'm no expert, but these stories are from when faster than light travel was arduous. That's why I think it's hiding "under our noses".
I totally agree with your point about the bubble. I don't agree DW station has to be near Raxxla, however, as we dont think they have found Raxxla
