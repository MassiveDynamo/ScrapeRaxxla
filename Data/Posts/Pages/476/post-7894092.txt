Now that was bizarre. When I relogged last night to take pictures, there was no facility nor anything else to be found anymore. The only proof I have that there was something there are the commodities I collected and still carry in my cargo hold. Should have suspected something when I did not get fined after shooting the Sentinels. Glitch or feature?
