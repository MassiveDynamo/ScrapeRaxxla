Misjumps should happen when FSD is around 80% integrity. But the game only implements work/doesn' t work mechanics, it seems.
Maybe trying to jump while still inside a neutron jet with the FSD already battered and overloading? But I bet it was already experimented.
Carrying weird stuff in a DBX, dropping into neutron star jet cones and messing about with nav computer with a broken FSD close to Polaris is a valid playing style. Hitting Eagle Eye network with torpedoes is too. Did you know Thargoids do not appear in signal sources inside the cone? Hafnium 178 actually doesn't explode if you use laser weapons on it. Most people have never even seen a comet. HIP 22460, 46 Eridani, Peregrina, all those are great spots too. Once I spent an evening playing the "final", or the "trails end" signal from a Thargoid structure around the bubble. Neumann Camp blackmarket should be familiar too. There are several systems that have stars of different ages. I want to know what happened to AJN Lion, where is Mic Turner buried and where was Jaques jumping into. Hipparchus is one of my favourite holiday destinations but I've forgotten why. Blanco cluster also. Maybe twenty other places that looked strange or could have been part of some raving theory at some point. It's crazy what this game can become when you go full tin-foil mode, such anarchic experience. It's all connected you know. Michael Brookes can you please consider continuing The Tau Ceti Mission.
