All right so as I said I'm in the NGC 7822 nebula again I am in s171 8 looking at the NGC 7822 nebula through a black hole while flying past it relatively close makes all of those beautiful supergiant blue stars spiral ridiculously. I'm tryin to make a few vid clips to yt it for speculation and analysis.
I did that legit 3 days ago and they do spiral to an extent, but non in the same direction and since most systems have at least one black hole in that area itâ€™s really difficult to pin point anything.
