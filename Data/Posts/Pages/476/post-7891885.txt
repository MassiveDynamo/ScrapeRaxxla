Ref the misjump, I've tried multiple versions of the method as described in "and here the wheel" and not yet got it to work:

I'm re-reading "and here the wheel" & been having a bash at mis-jumping as described towards the start of the book (initiating the jump then pressing jump again just before the tunnel).
It's not worked but it might be because I visited the local brewery this weekend and my reflexes are a bit 'tired'- has anyone else tried this or am I barking up the wrong tree?
I've checked here but its not really answered if it is included in the game or just some artistic licence from a book written before the game was finalised.

I'm going to spend the weekend around Dr Palins trying to get pulled by a thargoid, to see if I can find anything with the new disco scanner.
(just noticed this is the most suggestive sentence I've ever written in this forum!)
