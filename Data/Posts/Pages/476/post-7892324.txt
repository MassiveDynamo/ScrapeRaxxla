Now that's interesting. I went to the coordinates azoreanoutkast has given in his thread last night to have a look. What I found was not a crahsite, bute a facility that also did not show up on DSS. Lots of cargo racks scattered around it, but now data point so far. Think I'll investigate a bit further tonight, especially as azorean said the crashsite was not exactly of the coordinates given, but somewhere nearbey. If I find it and get peculiar messages I'll try to get pictures via my mobile.
