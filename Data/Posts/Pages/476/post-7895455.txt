Yes, that and the goids departing from the bubble lends weight to the hypothesis that humanity is about to step on the toes of the Klaxians, far more warlike than the Oresrian thargoids weâ€™ve seen to date, and that will be the end of humanity in the bubble (read Elite Premonition, and Out of The Darkness)

That would make for a good story but would be a bad business decision, which is why something dramatic will never happen.
