I did that legit 3 days ago and they do spiral to an extent, but non in the same direction and since most systems have at least one black hole in that area itâ€™s really difficult to pin point anything.
I got excited when I first noticed it but after I watched some yt on it I realized it wasnt unique to where I was. Had to jet back to Terminus though. Trouble in paradise
