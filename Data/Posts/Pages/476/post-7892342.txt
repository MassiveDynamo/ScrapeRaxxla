i highly doubt raxxla would be found with missjumps, even though they could lead to some other fun things. when it comes to hyperspace, the only way i see for raxxla to be related with it, is by a hyperdiction somewhere between two stars, after "certain requirements" have been met to trigger the event. but that leads us no where as to what requirements are thoses.
