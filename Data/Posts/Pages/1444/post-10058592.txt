Difference here is that we dont have a nice clear puzzle like that one - If the is a nice clear ciphertext then you have something to work on - history shows that such things are usually solved in a couple of days. But here we aren't sure if we even have a cipher in play let alone an obvious ciphertext. Also breaking ciphers with very short messages can be very difficult.

I set the following puzzle some years back (Christmas 2017 in fact) for a bunch of bright folk, highly numerate etc. They didn't solve it and to this day it remains unsolved - it was an object lesson to me how easy it is to set a puzzle that's just a bit too hard for the target audience:
