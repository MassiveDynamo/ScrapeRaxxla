Thanks @Rochester, @John Stoutbeard, good info, and that list is great thanks.

@CMDRCorrMorningstarFelian it's interesting that the 'Thargoid' mound on Soontil so closely matches that description from the old manual, nice find. It's yet another examples of how ED pulls from the older source text in interesting ways! It would bee nice to see something like that.


I have a general meta question for everyone, who do you think wrote the Raxxla Codex?

Jorki is right when he says that not many people at Fdev can know much about Raxxla because of the danger of leaks, and that goes back to the start. Raxxla has never been leaked, not even a hint, and for those people that seem to love leaking info like that big one we had a while back before Odyssey, Raxxla would surely be a big ticket item.

I've been assuming the Raxxla codex is drawn from the Lore bible material and maybe altered a bit... but do you think it was constructed later on? Was it written by Brookes before he moved on? Did Braben write it himself? Whoever did presumably knew what Raxxla is and where it is and how it fits with the lore since it has details no-ones ever seen before and info that's new to Elite Dangerous.

Same question really goes to the Dark Wheel codex too, since they're basically linked.
