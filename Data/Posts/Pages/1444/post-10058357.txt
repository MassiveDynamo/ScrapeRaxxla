Anyone know anything about Nuenets? It's next door to Shinrarta, a lot of DW missions take you to Nuenets, and the system description is weird:

"This busy trinary system has terrestrial planets orbiting the two companion stars. The locals aren't particularly friendly and appear to be harbouring a dark secret."

What dark secret?
