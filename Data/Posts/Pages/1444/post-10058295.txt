Do you think the distance from the Bubble which you can recover escape pods at crashes might be a hint (basically a hint about how far humans got). That is a fairly good ways outside the Bubble - possibly upwards of 1000 LY to 1500 LY from the Bubble. Once you pass this threshold, there are essentially zero human POIs if you do DSS scans.
