The "!" Used as a separator would be 7,55,557 if that means anything to anyone... Pipe (Stem) sector oi-t c3-19?

But the "To Raxxla!" And 6 digits made me think galmap... However the !'s still have me thinking why are they used at diff points... Are they indicating some clue to decryption...?

And I was trying to analyse S-V-O Vs V-S-O which is a published way of encrypting bits in plain text when I realised I'd overlooked the verbs missing in the toast...but then thought binary....and there's 6 numbers...
