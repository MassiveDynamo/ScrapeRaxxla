A small side-note, re-reading my own material - I realised I had misread the detail in the codex concerning our friend Mr Thorn-branch.

In the codex he is described as a Shipbased mechanic based in Tau Ceti. I read this as he was always in that system, but you can expect him to have worked in systems around there (gven the date, not too far away..).

Just a small clarification
