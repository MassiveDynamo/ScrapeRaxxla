Tinfoil ahead

When I googled "Nuenet mythology" I get a hit for Nu of Egyptian primordial mythology which involved "...the eight deities of the Ogdoad representing ancient Egyptian primordial Chaos from which the primordial mound arose from". Unsure if this is a legitimate connection or merely the Google algorithms making guesses at what this relates to exactly. Personally, just on the system description alone I'd be DSS scanning anything landable for odd POIs.

Highlighted text just because there is very, very weird mention of mounds mentioned both in connection to Soontill (story was in "..And Here the Wheel") and in the first game's manual. It may be nothing but the fact the myth mentions it may be a hint. Also, pay attention to the bit about what happens to the "Ascender of the Scent City" after they reach the top. Thargoid homeworld, maybe?
