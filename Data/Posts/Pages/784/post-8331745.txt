As I progress in my investigations into the Allies and Enemies of TDW in SD (based on mission types - POS or NEG), and affiliated with Macros Black's operation less than three I thought I'd share my spreadsheet for other's perusal.

RaNaketh's TDW / Permits / Tattoo Data

It also has my permit investigations, and now a tab for tattoos which I'll work on as I go and hopefully should be able to be accessed. If someone can verify they can see it for me that'd be great!

Fly Dangerously,
