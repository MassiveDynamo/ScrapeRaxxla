I agree it’s a decorative thing for anarchy/theocracy factions. Suspect it’s not really going to be that obvious. But yesterday visited Ray Gateway Diaguandri and the station owner XO to sell some beryllium from the Jameson crash site. Noticed top left of screen there were three symbols, think bottom was fed symbol, can’t remember middle, top symbol was like a sideways-on Griffin. TDW at Neuman Camp also showed the same symbol. Can’t say I’ve ever paid attention to these before. Anybody any ideas?
I think those are related to the faction not being associated with fed, imp or alliance. In lft 926 everyone but fong wang limited and green party of lft 926 have that next to their names in the right side panel status tab but show no affiliations in the mission screen. Fong wang and green party show federal.
