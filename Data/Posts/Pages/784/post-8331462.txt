I believe someone is working against us to preserve green party of lft 926. I cannot confirm this but we shouldnt be in war with los chupacabras because we just beat them last week and their influence was not moving previous to tdw's rise in status positioning
No bgs expert, but could be the Boom state making it an uphill battle.
Lots of massacre missions against Los Chupacabras. CZ's are very annoying due to their now short temporal nature.
Suggest collecting courier missions to same location if possible in-between small Massacre missions
