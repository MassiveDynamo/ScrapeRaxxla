The neck tattoos may be entirely decorative but meaningless?

Does TDW in SD have tattoos? Consistently across all their representatives?
We are told in Premonition that TRDW operates “wheels within wheels” and the SD faction are “merely a front”. I suspect the key is to find the inner wheels through some characteristic of the know outer wheel; is there anything else the SD faction exhibit? Background flags for instance?
Highly possible it's just decorative, but I live in hope we'll have something to actually follow to solve this!

I do suspect the four-leaf clover tattoo is a procedural generation for 'Anarchy' based factions (and Theocracy), especially after reviewing the posts in the Raxxla Discord. It might still be worth keeping an eye open for, but I'm more focused on the neck tattoos of the two engineers, and how that plays out. This doesn't seem to have been covered in the investigations in Discord?

As for TDW - two things I've noted are the 'checkered top (passenger mission guy), and a small badge which looks like Saturn or something similar which I've also noted on a few other factions around the area'. I'm starting up my own data collection on these and will post up any findings.
