Also, ive been told if your ship explodes it resets certain data you've obtained but dont have any real confirmation of this or what all data that effects.

Only data loss Iâ€™ve ever heard of on ship destruction is losing exploration data if not submitted to UC. Where did you hear this? Not a reddit rumour??
