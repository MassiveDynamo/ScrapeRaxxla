Was pondering whether my progress on the personal journey is monitored via the Cmdr Codex archive, e.g. beacons & sites visited. Had a strange experience this morning-visited the Jameson Cobra wreck site again this morning (good for stocking up on encoded materials so visited a few times week before last but having spent best part of a week engineering a Krait2 battlewagon to help progress my combat rank, I am now having to do the same for a corvette!); so had definitely already seen Jameson’s log messages. This morning they reappeared in my inbox, as though the game had forgotten I’d already seen them! Now this could be a problem if the game really is monitoring progress this way. I got Jameson’s logs years ago when the wreck was first found, but they weren’t in my codex entry-didn’t worry about it cos it was before the codex was introduced. But if it’s forgetting things I’ve done....
And the logs for the Cete and Bifrost weren’t stored there either!
I was also at Jameson's Cobra wreck at almost the same time, didn't see you there though. Next time, drop in for a Lavian Brandy!
I also had the log entries appear again, but it has been a long time since I was out here. I suspect it's simply a timer thing. If it's X days since last viewed, re-input into inbox.
