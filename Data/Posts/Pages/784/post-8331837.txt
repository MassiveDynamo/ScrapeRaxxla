Will do! Though usually play in solo, self-isolating since I have a cough (not new, had it for 3 weeks, log burner flue was leaking, lounge smelled like a smokehouse for 3 weeks ).
But I was at the crash site and got the logs early last week or late the week before; certainly well within 15 days so can’t be a timer issue. Also got them twice yesterday, thereafter it said I’d already scanned them....weird)

Are you flipping between Solo & PG, maybe 1 scan for each if so? If not probably just a 'feature' where it cant always keep up with itself. A software 'feature' variation.

Yes, system map comes from the exploration data you’ve been given, purchased or scanned+sold. If you don’t sell that data and get destroyed you’ll have to rescan the system next time you go there. Unless it’s system data that you’ve been given, that’s been sold by other players- when you enter a system and find its already 100% known to your system; not sure on the exact mechanism for this latter-assume more than one player has to sell it to UC for it “to become disseminated into the ship’s system maps” & think it only applies to inhabited systems.

I been wondering the same but may deserve its own thread if someone hasn't already discussed it somewhere.

Tatoos - Are they available through Holo-Me for your own character? I know some are but you had to buy them iirc so never did, long before free ARX, so don't know whats there and whats not. But if they are it may just be a decoration. Or stick one on your own forehead and see what happens
