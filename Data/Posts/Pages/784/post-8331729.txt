CMDR, There was an investigation on the Independent Raxxla Hunters discord into groups with the 4-leaf clover tattoo.
It lasted a couple months, then they found some player-created groups that had the tattoo.

You could look through the screenshots posted in the investigation '#groups with matching forehead tattoos [closed]' to see others with the neck tattoo.
If you find the neck tattoo on a player-created group, then you can probably assume it's random instead of an FDev clue trail.

Thanks for this Xaintly, I've gone through that thread and would agree with the matching four-leaf tattoo being a procedural generation for 'anarchy/theocracy' style groups. I'm more interested in the \V/ tattoo on the engineers Lori Jameson & Liz Ryder, so I'll keep investigating that.

I've also joined up the Discord (probably should have done that a while back!), thanks.
