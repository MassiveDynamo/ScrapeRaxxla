It may be worth while to pay closer attention to the left hand panel when in your srv.

The weird pop up things pointing to data points that give a mission can apparently occur without needing to do any mission or needing to scan the data points at a settlement etc. I landed at the charon crash site in sol, and this one showed up as soon as i was in the srv. I do not know what the trigger if any was. The charon site is a major pain to land at (even with a medium ship), and i had to self destruct the srv when my ship glitched out when recalled. It is also a 14k+ ls trip, and does not seem to spawn this sort of thing all the time. I am not certain if this is DW related or not but the game sent several elite npcs with weird behavior/builds after me when i accepted the mission.
