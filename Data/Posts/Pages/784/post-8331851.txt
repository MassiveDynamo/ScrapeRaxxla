Are you flipping between Solo & PG, maybe 1 scan for each if so? If not probably just a 'feature' where it cant always keep up with itself. A software 'feature' variation.



I been wondering the same but may deserve its own thread if someone hasn't already discussed it somewhere.

Tatoos - Are they available through Holo-Me for your own character? I know some are but you had to buy them iirc so never did, long before free ARX, so don't know whats there and whats not. But if they are it may just be a decoration. Or stick one on your own forehead and see what happens
