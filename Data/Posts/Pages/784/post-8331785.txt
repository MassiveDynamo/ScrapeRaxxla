Highly possible it's just decorative, but I live in hope we'll have something to actually follow to solve this!

I do suspect the four-leaf clover tattoo is a procedural generation for 'Anarchy' based factions (and Theocracy), especially after reviewing the posts in the Raxxla Discord. It might still be worth keeping an eye open for, but I'm more focused on the neck tattoos of the two engineers, and how that plays out. This doesn't seem to have been covered in the investigations in Discord?

As for TDW - two things I've noted are the 'checkered top (passenger mission guy), and a small badge which looks like Saturn or something similar which I've also noted on a few other factions around the area'. I'm starting up my own data collection on these and will post up any findings.

I agree it’s a decorative thing for anarchy/theocracy factions. Suspect it’s not really going to be that obvious. But yesterday visited Ray Gateway Diaguandri and the station owner XO to sell some beryllium from the Jameson crash site. Noticed top left of screen there were three symbols, think bottom was fed symbol, can’t remember middle, top symbol was like a sideways-on Griffin. TDW at Neuman Camp also showed the same symbol. Can’t say I’ve ever paid attention to these before. Anybody any ideas?
