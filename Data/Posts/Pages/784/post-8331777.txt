From not having system maps in nearby systems ive been to numerous times. When i asked other players i play with, this was the reason i was given. It made sense as to why a system i mine often would be gone. But who knows, right

Yes, system map comes from the exploration data you’ve been given, purchased or scanned+sold. If you don’t sell that data and get destroyed you’ll have to rescan the system next time you go there. Unless it’s system data that you’ve been given, that’s been sold by other players- when you enter a system and find its already 100% known to your system; not sure on the exact mechanism for this latter-assume more than one player has to sell it to UC for it “to become disseminated into the ship’s system maps” & think it only applies to inhabited systems.
