I was also at Jameson's Cobra wreck at almost the same time, didn't see you there though. Next time, drop in for a Lavian Brandy!
I also had the log entries appear again, but it has been a long time since I was out here. I suspect it's simply a timer thing. If it's X days since last viewed, re-input into inbox.

Will do! Though usually play in solo, self-isolating since I have a cough (not new, had it for 3 weeks, log burner flue was leaking, lounge smelled like a smokehouse for 3 weeks ).
But I was at the crash site and got the logs early last week or late the week before; certainly well within 15 days so can’t be a timer issue. Also got them twice yesterday, thereafter it said I’d already scanned them....weird)
