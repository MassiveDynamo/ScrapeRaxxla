Ill have to look now, 'almost close' could mean an extra 'rank bar' of some description? Like the Decals for Harmless - Elite?

Disclaimer - I think its just decoration but its a nice side-track and just curious anyway.

Just a thought but now we know that Drew Wagar knows whether DW in SD is real one or not, and that he wrote all the GalNet stories about Salome, and I think all the beacon and clues etc as well, does that add some info to the 'Shadowy Revolution' that Salome refers to in the beacon? She definitely implies they are the 'bad guys' but she was supposed to be in touch with the 'real' DW wasn't she, exposing The Club and Exodus? If it was the 'real' DW all the way through or not. Or is The Club behind the DW or the DW behind The Club (less likely as DB invention) or are they at war with each other.

Controversial - if / when all this is solved we may have a new word CodFluff so just keep that in mind when looking for 'clues' in the Codex.

From a livestream early last year, Drew mentioned the Club and The Dark Wheel as separate entities. He said they are aware of each other, and don't really interfere with one another unless their goals conflict. From the book Premonitions we gather that the real DW is much, much larger then the Club, which appears to be only a small group of very powerful individuals.
