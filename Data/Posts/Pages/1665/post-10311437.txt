If you draw a line between Alioth and Achenar it goes very close to Sol - although i think Sol is nearer to Alioth than Achenaer so while there is an Axis its not totally symmetrical.

If you want to associate that Axis with heaven and hell…Since Achenar is heavily associated with underworld named systems near it -id put it as Hell. And by sake of the line - Alioth fits as the Heavens? With good ole Sol being itself… humanities little garden.
Mmm, from what I understand of the Miltonian mythology that sounds like a good argument for Raxxla to be in/near Sol!!!
