Ive been playing a little with this - but im having trouble seeing it. There is a spot that i think is itâ€¦ but want to know if you can give a relative time stamp or show the area within a full jump. I will have to play around with moving my head around too i guess. - ive been doing recordings as i make my way slowly towards SagA. Just passed Thors Eye.
The post that I replied to was D7's original post, in that there's an image that shows exactly where it appears in the recording of a hyperspace jump. It's always in the same place on every jump (that I've so far checked), so once you see it you'll fin it easy to spot.
