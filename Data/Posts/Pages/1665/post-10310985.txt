However Drew Wagar said several times that neither he nor the other book authors knew anything about Raxxla. So if you accept the hypothesis that MB located Raxxla based on the Miltonian mythology then it follows that this description of the frontier was just Drew's storytelling and not related to Raxxla, or that MB influenced Drew to describe it in that way. And I think Drew is intelligent enough to see any such manipulation and pursue it...so I suspect the description is just coincidence based on how a frontier bubble would operate- think of the old American Wild West cowboy tales, or more appropriately watch Firefly (one of the best sci-fi series ever made and cut short disastrously early, as was Dark Matter which was pulled just as the aliens invaded )
Firefly was a good series.

I think it is absolutely out of the question that any of the authors have written hints about Raxxla. They did not have the knowledge and FD was not that deep in the writing process. The only exception is Premonition.
In Premonition FD had the opportunity to give Drew elements that should be included, without necessarily telling him why.

If the release books have anything of value in them, it's because FD have reverse engineered Raxxla to fit the books. Not the other way around.

I also think it's wise not to overestimate the amount of control and time MB had, with regards to the Raxxla mystery. Resources were limited in the period before release. Time was limited and the amount of usable game mechanics were limited. MB would have done little to non of the actual implementation.
