Though I do agree the Frontier on the books is not a direct reference, it did put me thinking about the internal frontiers of the bubble - hence the post.

I also started thinking about the Omphalos Rift again - there's quite a few Creation-related stones across mythologies:
the Black Stone inside the Kaaba (towards which the daily Islamic prayers are pointed) is mentioned as having fallen from Jannah (the Heaven of Islam) to show Adam and Eve where to build the first temple on Earth
the Foundation Stone in Jerusalem is associated with the Holy of Holies and cited on the Talmud as where the world was created from
the capstones of Egyptian pyramids were modeled after the benben, the first piece of land to emerge out of the primordial waters
