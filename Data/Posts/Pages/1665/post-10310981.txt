If the Bubble was designed as an abstraction of Milton's cosmos, said lands are not a bad candidate for Chaos... with Federal space representing the visible universe, perhaps?
The tricky thing with Federal space is that its distribution - even before nine years of Federal factions being crushed in the BGS - was not that concentrated.

Imperial and Alliance systems (especially at the start of the game) were in distinct dense clusters around Achenar, Alioth and to an extent Lave and very rarely found far outside that.
Federal systems were more common around Sol but could be found frequently anywhere in the bubble except the Empire and Alliance cores. The edge of Federal space and the edge of the bubble were almost identical.

While they're not in charge so much nowadays, a look through frontier systems for native Federal factions should still let you approximate the original extent.

(FE2/FFE did have a much stronger distinction between the Federal core around Sol and the largely Independent frontier systems)
