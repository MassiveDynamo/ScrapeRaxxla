Since my vacation started with a 10-hour long flight across the ocean, I took the opportunity to read Reclamation at last.

Throughout Salome's journey, her companions Hassan and Space Mario Luko talk often about the Frontier, i.e. the edge of the Bubble. Another frontier comes up during Halsey's disappearance, as she was touring the Federal borderlands whose rebellions dominated early GalNet alongside the Emperor Hengist succession shenanigans.

If the Bubble was designed as an abstraction of Milton's cosmos, said lands are not a bad candidate for Chaos... with Federal space representing the visible universe, perhaps?
