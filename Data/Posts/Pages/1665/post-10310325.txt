when looking at the vesper system and their transport faction (resembling) i noticed nearby system seemingly (possible shibboleth?) named after a japanese folk dragon princess from the undersea castle. system also has native npc anarchy dragon faction and an asteroid base.
ive also noticed system with native npc faction sisterhood of the hunt, outpost artemis' nest and ground port hunters prospect.
thought might be worth noting as artemis and snakes/dragons are such an insignificant characters...
