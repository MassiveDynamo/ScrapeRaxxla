Agreed, but if any author gave out clues it was MB- I'm still pondering if Raxxla is in Alliance space -from Legacy:
"As a girl Julia grew up without toys with a single possession, a book “about a young man’s quest to save a princess from an alien dragon” (a clue??) locked alone each day in the tiny family cell while her parents slaved in the mines. She hoped to keep her Eagle as she’d grown accustomed to its idiosyncrasies...”whether it was a suitable ship for travelling all the way to Alliance space (another clue?) was another matter”.
