Since my vacation started with a 10-hour long flight across the ocean, I took the opportunity to read Reclamation at last.

Throughout Salome's journey, her companions Hassan and Space Mario Luko talk often about the Frontier, i.e. the edge of the Bubble. Another frontier comes up during Halsey's disappearance, as she was touring the Federal borderlands whose rebellions dominated early GalNet alongside the Emperor Hengist succession shenanigans.

If the Bubble was designed as an abstraction of Milton's cosmos, said lands are not a bad candidate for Chaos... with Federal space representing the visible universe, perhaps?
However Drew Wagar said several times that neither he nor the other book authors knew anything about Raxxla. So if you accept the hypothesis that MB located Raxxla based on the Miltonian mythology then it follows that this description of the frontier was just Drew's storytelling and not related to Raxxla, or that MB influenced Drew to describe it in that way. And I think Drew is intelligent enough to see any such manipulation and pursue it...so I suspect the description is just coincidence based on how a frontier bubble would operate- think of the old American Wild West cowboy tales, or more appropriately watch Firefly (one of the best sci-fi series ever made and cut short disastrously early, as was Dark Matter which was pulled just as the aliens invaded )
