Oo, interesting!
Perhaps I havent got the method right yet?
Paste signal reference into galmap search, then if game doesnt crash select it & drop in, or if it does crash the game then redo but bookmark it? Which should allow it to be selected from the bookmarks list & dropped onto?
As soon as I bookmarked those two I got the Black Adder error message.

Also interesting 36 locked onto an npc!!

Edit: Yep, just rechecked your video re bodies 68-70. The only thing I can see that I’m doing different is that you were using Odyssey and I’m using Horizons & getting an error on bookmarking the signal.
