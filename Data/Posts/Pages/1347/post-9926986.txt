So canidate for TDW station...

Decima - Gustypants Outback Emporium

This one is NOT it but it fits the bill, large wheel style station, compact and older orbis - plus when the sun isn't hitting it, it's really dark.

Now if I could only narrow down systems with this version of an orbis station..... ok found it.



I'll be checking it out in the morning.

--edit--
The hub looks good and is controlled by the minor faction 'The Dark Wheel' but seems lacking in real evidence of what it would be.
