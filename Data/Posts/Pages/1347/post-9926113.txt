Just a thought on a plot twist... I think most ideas on the roar are about a Queen Thargoid (or just a new bigger one!)...

As the sound hadn't been heard before and we've been messing with Guardian tech and mixing it with Thargoid tech, it might be an interesting plot twist that the Guardians didn't die out and we've basically alerted them with the proteus wave...or something like that ;-)


All pure speculation and highly unlikely.... but it was "just a thought" which I often post here....
