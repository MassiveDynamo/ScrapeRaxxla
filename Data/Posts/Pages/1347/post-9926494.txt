Have you tried this system?

"Myth", "comet", missing pilot, Federal Task force, head of the Bounty Hunters Guild....

Bit much for a myth?

Edit: more searching, looks like it's been explained...

Ahh the comet, a great example of overthinking a problem.

I used that story to test a theory, to assess if Galnet stories had any relevance; ended up reading too much into the text and choosing the wrong system and grinded the permit for Alioth instead.

Turned out the mystery was in the other system and was very easy to resolve.

Still a nice little player story; but at least I got the Alioth permit and had fun killing lots of pirates, probably more fun than the actual mystery.
