As (possibly) an interesting aside:
Siren was the final boss of Pharos Sirius in Final Fantasy XIV (2010)!
thats because FFXIV draws from the same mythology as elite, greek...
Pharos has something to do with the lighthouse in Alexandria, theres a lot to this and i can go on, but theres more to be figured out first, lets just say it goes back to the return of the thargoids, Dolphins
