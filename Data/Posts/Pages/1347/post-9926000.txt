Ejagham is an interesting system. Bodyids 35 & 36 crashed the system but I knew I hadnt found the two stations so kept at it. Later went back & tried bookmarking those two, but as soon as I did that I got Black Adder errors each time. No Omphalos or TDW hidden station, unless it's at 35 or 36!
Cant see a way to find them!!
(N.B. Ejagham 4 has 8 moons!! And travel in a straight(ish) line from Sol (Jewel/Mother Gaia) via Sirius (Witchspace whisperer) you get eventually to Ejagham (tourist beacon mentions lovers, binary ice moons resemble original start menu screen with station)).

Each time I drop into a comet I honk three times - but Raxxla is hitting the pipes!
