So far I canâ€™t figure out who made that leap.
Gotta be me, there was a discount on tinfoil hat lately and.. well.
Beyond that, I was thinking myself about using a Trinket while searching Raxxla.
These things are used in The Dark Wheel missions. Possibly the Trinket would emit some sort of indication when approaching Raxxla or the Omphalos (activate it in some way?)
That would explain why one need "eyes to see". Without Good Fortune, you're blind, and could fly past Raxxla without knowing it.
Omphalos is real world reference to the Temple of Apollo which hosted one. It was considered the center of the world (as known back then).
In game, which world center would we be talking about? Most probably not Human Space, eh?
