Just a thought on a plot twist... I think most ideas on the roar are about a Queen Thargoid (or just a new bigger one!)...

As the sound hadn't been heard before and we've been messing with Guardian tech and mixing it with Thargoid tech, it might be an interesting plot twist that the Guardians didn't die out and we've basically alerted them with the proteus wave...or something like that ;-)


All pure speculation and highly unlikely.... but it was "just a thought" which I often post here....
That is already being whispered a little. I’m trying to find out if anyone has taken a T relic to a guardian side and tried to use it as normal. I’ve been wondering if any kind of reaction occurs from the other species. And I’m still trying to find anything in the Lore that would have given rise to the guardians came from Raxxla theory. So far I can’t figure out who made that leap. So it could be absolute bull for all I know. If you guys like I can update you if I find something out.
