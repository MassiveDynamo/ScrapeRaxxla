Just got back in the bubble, this stuff is really interesting, will dust off the Mk3 tonight and have a fly around.
Never took much notice of Pluto, i was more interested in Persephone as in real terms its not actually a planet, but in Elite it is.
Also i never knew Halley's was in the system (been to the Voyagers), cheers for that, something else to look at.

You could search back in this thread for posts by Pyroboros. Unfortunately that method was deemed verboten by FD & borked so is only of historic interest. But Halleyâ€™s comet is (was, not tried recently) targetable by the galmap searchbar and you can then fly to it in-system and drop out of SC at its location. However there is nothing to see! You just get the name displayed in the lower left HuD panel.
