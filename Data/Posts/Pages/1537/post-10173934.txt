Additional possibility using the concept of shibboleths...

We appear to have a system named Poseidon (Greek equivalent of Neptune) somewhere in the Human Bubble. ED Companion and INARA seem to suggest anarchy system with only a star. Don't know if that indicates we should be scanning unidentified signal sources near suspected celestial bodies.

Oberon, sadly, doesn't seem to have any hints via secondary meanings of the name. I have suspicions that "The Dark Wheel" may have some hints at least about Raxxla. The Dark Wheel itself seems to be less so covered.
