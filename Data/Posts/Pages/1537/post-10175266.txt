A thought occured...
We are told in the codex that TDW are “a legendary group of adventurers, explorers, investigators and treasure-hunters”

Such adventurers & explorers undertake “ventures”

Parties of people who undertake ventures are Venturers

The faction who hold the Delphi Control Chapter installation at Pluto-Charon barycentre is
Sol Constitution Party...

Parties undertake ventures...so possibly an obfuscated name?

Sol Constitution Venturers? ... SCV

A wheel is a cycle, like a cyclic shift, perhaps a Caesar cypher...
SCV one place shifted becomes TDW

The Greek Omphalos Stone was located in the temple at Delphi...

Just a thought
