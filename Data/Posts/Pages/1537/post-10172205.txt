Off-topic question.
Just upgraded the PC 256Gb system SSD to 2Tb. What’s the best way to use that extra space? I’ve currently got the new C drive partition extended to 1Tb and was wondering whether to add in an extra drive in the unallocated space or instead extend C out to fill it....
I know just enough about computers to be dangerous!

Edit
Just been googling and found “Generally, around 10-20% free space is recommended to allow the SSD to perform its internal operations, such as garbage collection and wear leveling, efficiently.”

So, leave 200Gb to 400Gb unallocated on a 2Tb SSD?

oooh, the Crucial Storage Executive utility has an option for "Over Provisioning"... need to read more!

mmm, web consensus seems to be that SSD Over Provisioning is overcomplication & not necessary if the total used is less than 60% or so...
now to decide if I should have one large partition or two separate...

Went with one large partition
