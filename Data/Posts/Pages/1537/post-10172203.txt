Hope you feel better soon mate! Funnily enough I had one threatening to start Sunday morning, with some odd visual effects...closed down the PC and lay quietly for a while until it stopped...maybe too much coffee.

The trouble with this sort of “narrative lock” is that there is supposed to be an accompanying narrative to explain it/give it context. I suspect the narrative was lost long ago-when I first got the Sol permit, early 2016, I went to Triton and there was a steady stream of npc military fed navy ships going to and departing from the moon. That traffic has stopped & never seen any hint of explanation.
