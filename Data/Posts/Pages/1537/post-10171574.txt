Me too, just wondering if thereâ€™s a hidden way to get the permit.
Going off the Hero's Journey theme perhaps hacking Primary Transport Authority (or whatever that installation way on the edge of Sol is called) out near Persephone with recon limpets. By the way, the bigger the limpet controller the faster it can hack into the system and start data extraction. Though, may be worth looking for an anarchy system with installations to get good at it. The few times I have done this every second matters.
