The trouble with this sort of “narrative lock” is that there is supposed to be an accompanying narrative to explain it/give it context. I suspect the narrative was lost long ago-when I first got the Sol permit, early 2016, I went to Triton and there was a steady stream of npc military fed navy ships going to and departing from the moon. That traffic has stopped & never seen any hint of explanation.
Isn't Conjoint Mathematic Services scientific installation in orbit of Neptune? I am pretty sure I went there personally. Given the story of the Ryder brother's split (they were notably connected via name to Neptune and Uranus - Neptune and Oberon). Having mentioned the brother's names - go check out Oberon which is landable.

My personal suspicion is Triton was the other brother's base. This theory, though, has a much darker component to it. We know Triton and Moon are permit locked (it actually states as much on the system map) which entails powerful people wanting it covered up. The darker part connects back to Amiay at Cooperworld, Beta Hydri, and Sol and the religious order that has one of its' three bases of operations in Sol. Oh, and where is Zachary "Calico Zach" Rackham's supposed home system? Part of me wants Rackham to win the upcoming election but part of me is terrfied what that may entail.
