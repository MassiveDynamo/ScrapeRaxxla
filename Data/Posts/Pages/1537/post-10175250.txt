Anyone know the puzzle of the 6 pointed star, worth a shot haven't seen it in here yet

The outer numbers may spell a system name or give proper coords





Added extra alphabet based off of dots dashes....


In the Dark Wheel they spent some time describing the face of Patrick McGreavy....

"But it was not the wizened, crusty old space trader who appeared on the screen as Alex accepted the call. Nothing like.
It was a human being, and not a humanoid alien that faced them. But what had happened to its face was beyond description. There were many ways to change ordinary human looks to nightmarish caricatures of the same: flying too close to certain stars, being exposed to the interstellar vacuum too often, working in certain ore and mineral mines . . . But Alex, as he stared at the lumpy, grey swellings that swathed this person's flesh, could not imagine what grotesque disaster had befallen the caller.
Lips like quivering gossamer wings trembled in the grey flesh. A hand, skeletal and crippled, shot through with bright red blood vessels, touched the wispy ginger hair that grew in a bizarre floral circle around the deformed head."
