Agreed, I see it as a focal point, the centre, potentially around which these clues revolve.

I’ve always suspected the “has been circulating, in whispers, for centuries” as potential clue, especially in regards to the various “whispers” narratives, such as with the Gen ships.

At first look these all seem too widely dispersed, but I’ve always wondered if viewed on their own do they triangulate towards a common centre? (ignoring Sol). Would seem a little obvious!

How many of these “whispers” were there! Or are these unrelated, discarded Guardian breadcrumbs?
Don't forget that First Encounters journals had Bubble ships (possibly a form of generation ship) originate out of Wolf 630 and Phiagre (both of which are in game). There is also the tiny matter of Achenar getting humans but we still have no trace of the Mayflower 97. There is also the weirdness of the body Duval's Grave in Capella which is definitely not on a straight line path from Tau Ceti to Achenar. Lawrence's Grave is in the same system as is the Nobleworld. Capella is a Federation system. It would be weird as hell for Marlin Duval's brother to take her all the way up there to stage a death (it is 160.97 LY from Achenar). Sol to Achenar is 139.45 LY between the two.

Marlin Duval died in 2296.

Both Sol -> Capella and Tau Ceti -> Capella are about 42 lightyears (just barely over that).
