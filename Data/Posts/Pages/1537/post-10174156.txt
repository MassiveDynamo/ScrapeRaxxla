Agreed, I see it as a focal point, the centre, potentially around which these clues revolve.

I’ve always suspected the “has been circulating, in whispers, for centuries” as potential clue, especially in regards to the various “whispers” narratives, such as with the Gen ships.

At first look these all seem too widely dispersed, but I’ve always wondered if viewed on their own do they triangulate towards a common centre? (ignoring Sol). Would seem a little obvious!

How many of these “whispers” were there! Or are these unrelated, discarded Guardian breadcrumbs?
