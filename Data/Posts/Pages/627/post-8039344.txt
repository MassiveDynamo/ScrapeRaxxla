@Thatchinho: Is that a quote from the stream Vetinari was trying to recall, or elsewhere?
@Vetinari : was it Adam Waite?? (Actually I think his name is Adam Bourke-Waite)
Not a quote, just listed the types of rewards. It can always be added to if someone spots something that's missing.

(And on the other front, Adam B-W seems like the most likely candidate to me as well. )
