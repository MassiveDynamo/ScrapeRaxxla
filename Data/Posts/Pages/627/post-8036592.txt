Well, hope itâ€™s not too difficult. Strained shoulder ligaments & torn front deltoid. May not be able to play for a week or more. No way could I fight off interdictions. Not sure I could even get my hand to the joystick!
Jorki, you need to train your ship's dog to work the HOTAS whilst you sit back and just utter the occasional "Make it so"
I left my ship's cat in charge a while back (whilst making an in-flight cup of tea) Came back to find her asleep on the job (and keyboard) and all my heatsinks launched! Going to use her only for working the Galmap in future, as away of flying to random points looking for Raxxla
