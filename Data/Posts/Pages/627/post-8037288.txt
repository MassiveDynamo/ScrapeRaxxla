Jorki, you need to train your ship's dog to work the HOTAS whilst you sit back and just utter the occasional "Make it so"
I left my ship's cat in charge a while back (whilst making an in-flight cup of tea) Came back to find her asleep on the job (and keyboard) and all my heatsinks launched! Going to use her only for working the Galmap in future, as away of flying to random points looking for Raxxla

Mmm, it was the shipâ€™s cat that caused this injury, and the copawlot is a chocolate labrador.

Mad as a box of frogs!
