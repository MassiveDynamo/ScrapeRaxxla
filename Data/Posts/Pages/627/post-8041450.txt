First mention of Raxxla is in Tau Ceti in 2296, but already a myth by then according to the codex.
Yeah, this. "According to the Codex". Because according to The Dark Wheel novel, that "myth" was unknown to Alex Ryder... therefore, it would be logical to assume, unknown to most of the people.

Anyway, from Wiki:
This timeline covers events from the first three games of the Elite series as well as novels. There are some discrepancies* between events listed and their representation in the fourth and current game, Elite Dangerous.

*I bet there are.
