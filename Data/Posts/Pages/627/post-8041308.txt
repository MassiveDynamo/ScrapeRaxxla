@Vetinari: ED Hot Tpoics Q&A -Missions of Dec13: 2016:
This was, I think, v2.2, or during 2.2 beta test period.
Around 42 minutes Adam B-W answers Edelgard von Rhein’s question about Elite missions such as Obfuscated in the Outer Rim. At 44 mins Dom Carnegie (?) discusses inbox missions - you have to be in-system for 15 minutes to get one. At 1:00:00 improved in-space (inbox) missions is a future thing.

Adam B-W refers to a previous livestream which discussed missions but I can’t find it! The previous one is Hot Topics Q&A Dec 6, 2916 (pre 2.2.3 beta) with Ed, Sandro & Mark Allen. Just finished that & nothing relevant to the Quest that I could see. Can’t find another with AB-W. Were missions addressed in BGS vids, e.g. with Dav Stott?
