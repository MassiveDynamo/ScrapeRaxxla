Well, hope itâ€™s not too difficult. Strained shoulder ligaments & torn front deltoid. May not be able to play for a week or more. No way could I fight off interdictions. Not sure I could even get my hand to the joystick!
Assuming you are right handed... You could learn to use joystick with your left hand. I did, throwing away old conventions took some months, but it had to be done to achieve certain goals. In this solve et coagula, also the two modes of flight assist were made to switch places in function. Allegorical tinfoil-mysticism is strong with this one. Few of my ships have gimballed weapon systems anymore. Then other things happened, chaotic things, and bounty hunters are always a few jumps behind. The number of starports that let me access station services is constantly dwindling. But it was all worth it.
