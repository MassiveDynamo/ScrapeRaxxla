Yeah heard that but cannot track it down, seems to be an Eastern Europe / Russia group that are behind it but whether they hacked the game and added a 9th Galaxy or if it was all urban myth I just cannot find out.....so probably just myth told by different people with different perceptions of how true it is.....and 'I know somebody who has...' is an argument used all over the world when really it was just heard from someone else, who probably said the same thing.

Sure I first heard it in the late 80s early 90s but no idea where from, can only imagine a British magazine picked it up as I wasnt on BBS or knew anybody else who played at the time, I do remember thinking it was unfair it wasnt in the British version and only released in the Russian version (which it wasnt but that must have been what Id read or implied from reading). Never got to the source of it though when looked into it years later / recently.
