Raxxla? Or am I missing context?
Of course , it that shal not be named Aparently the sectors were numbered in the early days and then changed to their current labels. I have no idea if these numbers match those reported numbers , this is the only thing I could find. Only started my journey in 3305. maybe someone around that era can shed some light

There is an old myth that it was in the 9th galaxy map after doing some reverse system flying and other hocus pocus. I think it was in a russian gamer magazine. I would think that there would be a video of someone doing it if there was actually anything behind it. I know the 1984 elite and others versions has been ripped apart and had the code sampled but nothing was ever found ( to my knowledge) .

Has anyone ever gone out and checked off all the discoveries in the codex?
