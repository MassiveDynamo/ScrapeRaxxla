In the original Elite in 1984 there were 8 'Galaxies', that needed a special hyperjump to travel between and then you could jump around that 'galaxy' systems using normal Jumpdrive with 7LY range (its still not clear exactly what the different 'galaxies' represented but probably not that important, Galaxy 1 contained Lave and the old worlds that are so nostalgic for that reason). Technically speaking each system had 256 systems due to memory limitations so they did 7 more just for extra gameplay I think.

There were rumours / urban myths that a hidden 9th Galaxy existed (it didnt and iirc Frontier and DB have confirmed it didnt exist in the official released version) and in that 9th Galaxy was supposedly Raxxla, supposedly found by a player, the first hoax about Raxxla that really took off. Then there were hundred and one variations of how to get there to the 9th Galaxy. Some magazines picked up on it and published it and the legend was born.

So yeah, region 9 (as it is was previously numbered in 2015, now named by submissions by players or Frontier, theres a 3rd version that shows all the player submitted or player used names as well that isnt official) Region 9 has become the new 9th Galaxy it seems

Could be, theres a 1 in 42 chance it is, and theres a lot of star systems in it.

Wow. Thank you so much for the deep dive. Genuinely appreciate the story behind it. I didn't expect such detail.
