Do we actually think that Raxxla is something that can be "found" in space rather than it being a planet to land on or it being planet-side? Following the reasoning that it could be found even before Horizons, it would make sense somehow.

Then taking it from system to system probably wouldn't change gravity in those systems all that much.
