raxxla is simply not going to be something you see (or would have seen) by honking a system or the process that is current where you're sitting in supercruise and see it.

It's going to be something you'll have to drop into normal space to find. I still think putting it in a roid cluster is the most obvious choice since nobody goes to each cluster in a system ...hardly anyone goes to 1 cluster in a system. And there are options that can be used in doing this story wise that lets fdev off the hook in creating lots of crazy content around raxxla. They could have it destroyed, with only debris being found. The roid cluster itself, could be the remains. If they were smart, they wouldn't be hiding a station as that seems to cause undesguisable changes in the system on the galaxy map so whatever raxxla ends up being in the game, it's probably a place-holder ship or debris.

My vote is debris, since discovering any kind of raxxla that is intact and would otherwise be acquirable and accessible to humans would alter the entire game's narrative. I dont think fdev wants an event that derails their narrative that could happen at any time to be a possibility.
