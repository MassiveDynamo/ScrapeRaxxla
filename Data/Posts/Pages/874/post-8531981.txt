I've honked at least a couple of ly out. The reported body count is still the same.
Yeah, now you say it, that's direct confirmation of a lower limit. And so for me it's a 'can't absolutely 100% rule it out, but it's ruled out sufficiently that there's no way I'd personally be pursuing it in the absence of anything to actually suggest to do so.'. Everyone else can make their own judgements, obviously!
