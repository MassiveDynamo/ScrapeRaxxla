I'm about 23 hours out from supercruising to 509 for a laugh (and rule out what obviously won't work)... but also check the nav panel for nothing unusual... I suspect it might take a few days to actually be disappointed if I don't get bored and go and look down another rabbit hole... ;-)

I have honked every so often... nothing extra...
Keep an eye on the fuel gauge. You do run out eventually.
