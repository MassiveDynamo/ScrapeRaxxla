I'm about 23 hours out from supercruising to 509 for a laugh (and rule out what obviously won't work)... but also check the nav panel for nothing unusual... I suspect it might take a few days to actually be disappointed if I don't get bored and go and look down another rabbit hole... ;-)

I have honked every so often... nothing extra...

Wait!
There’s a rabbit hole??
We never looked for Raxxla there!
So we’re looking for Raxxla the Rabbit? 👁
