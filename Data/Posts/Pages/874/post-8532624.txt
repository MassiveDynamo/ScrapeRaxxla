Do we actually think that Raxxla is something that can be "found" in space rather than it being a planet to land on or it being planet-side? Following the reasoning that it could be found even before Horizons, it would make sense somehow.

Then taking it from system to system probably wouldn't change gravity in those systems all that much.

Whether it is on a planet or not has nothing to do with horizons.. you wouldn't need to interact with it to discover it.

Also, any conclusion that leaves raxxla intact requires a lot of changes and content from fdev... Which doesn't seem like a logical option for them... So it is most likely something that can be discovered but no longer a factor in the game universe.
