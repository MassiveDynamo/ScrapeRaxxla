I'm about 23 hours out from supercruising to 509 for a laugh (and rule out what obviously won't work)... but also check the nav panel for nothing unusual... I suspect it might take a few days to actually be disappointed if I don't get bored and go and look down another rabbit hole... ;-)

I have honked every so often... nothing extra...
Worst case scenario - you get to have a bit of fun with some extreme SC speeds, and trying to actually get close to the target marker in that situation.
