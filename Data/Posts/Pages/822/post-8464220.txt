There has been at least one war previously between humanity and Thargoids; the INRA mycoid attack ensured humanity’s victory last time round. The indications are that’s going to change in the next one.

And Here The Wheel and Out Of The Darkness both say there was at least one diplomatic meeting between goids and humans prior to the war. So not sure The Club were the first to know about goids, but they appear for a long time to have been manipulating galactic media and finance markets for their own ends. It may be those ends are altruistic, but the hints we have from Premonition seem to negate that.
Yeah I highly doubt that. They sound like anything but "good". They did kill a lot of people for starters.
