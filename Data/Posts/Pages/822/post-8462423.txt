I bumped into an old hand of this thread - he of the t-shirts (some will know of whom I speak) - he asked if I could remind the prestigious contirbutore of this thread of a few factlets about Luko:

Luciano Giovanni Prestigio, aka Luko, is an actual IRL person. He was the Roman taxi driver who terrified DW by driving crazy through Rome, when he was asked to make haste because DW was extremely late for taking a plane at the airport ? DW never forgot that ride through Rome, and then named Luko character after that skillful driver ! Hence, it has nothing to do with any clue regarding Prester John. Jorki really needs to avoid that Lavian Brandy.. now !

Meanwhile - back to the music
