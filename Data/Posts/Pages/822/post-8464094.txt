Good summary by you and Jpotter. As expected there was nothing new from Drew, but it's always good with clarification.

Vulpecula could definitively cover the mid point between the two birds (Cygnus the swan and Aquila the eagle) and intersection with the RA 20h line. I think Dumbell nebula is a fair estimate of direcction.

Even Lyra is known as a bird in many cultures. Often the vulture. This makes things a bit more unclear (if that is possible ) .

The Summer triangle region on the RA 20h line, is at least very interesting.

Interesting thanks.

I just wanted to add, speaking of birds,

"According to the myths regarding the founding of the Delphic Oracle, Zeus, in his attempt to locate the center of the earth, launched two eagles from the two ends of the world, and the eagles, starting simultaneously and flying at equal speed, crossed their paths above the area of Delphi, and so was the place where Zeus placed the stone (Omphalos)."

Aquila constellation seem to mean eagle like you said. It's getting really interesting.

Also some say Omphalos was used to communicate with the gods. The Club may have used it to receive communications, which could be why they had knowledge of the existence of Thargoids before anyone else. Who knows what else they would know?
