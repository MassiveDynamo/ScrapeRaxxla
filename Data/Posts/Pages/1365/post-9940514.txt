Note to be aware of, from my initial investigations it seems apparent that FD Support and FD Dev Team have access to different information.

Eg you ask them about SD DW and the missions etc they may say ‘working as intended’. You cross examine that with additional evidence to the contrary and it gets escalated to the devs who confirm… removed etc.

I don’t think this is obfuscation, it’s standard IP protection snd Support likely have standard responses to certain prompts.

In the case it’s no longer a reliable response.

We also have to consider for human error. In RL errors are made, spelling omissions although rare are not outside the realms of possibility. I know some very qualified word-smiths and authors, who are terrible at spelling. I also know a few publishing houses who are terrible at proof checking.

this is all true, however the hypothesis of multiple factions within PF is proven by getting two separate Allied status- Jorki is Allied with PF Local Branch in SD through missions and also (& quite seperately, like years apart) with PilotsFederation for rescuing passengers from burning stations and bashing goids.
We have a TB saying that TDW is a faction within PF, and in those E/F missions the PF was often the mission giver of missions to take things from the visible TDW faction. So I think it's a viable hypothesis that one of the PF factions is the real DWand this may be the route forward. Unfortunately with my hand problems BH/Assassination/Anti-pirate ops is really a non-starter.
