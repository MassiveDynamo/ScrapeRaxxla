You saw I imagine that there's a systematic search (*) effort of every system in a 200 ly range from earth that began a few years ago?
65% done and nothing so far...
(*) It would help immensely if there was a universal methodology to apply, or a list of key points to check, by everyone in search for Raxxla so we can rule out systems for certain once searched. Alas since we're not sure what we are looking for we can't. It's like real research
Yes, but I said when it started that it was a waste of effort. They dont know what they're looking for, so what are the odds they’ll find it? Have they tried boosting at every NS/WD? Have they dived each BH? They certainly haven’t dropped in & honked each comet while carrying some Trinkets in the hold, because we’ve only recently figured out how to do that.

Ive always said it is highly unlikely that Raxxla is a body named as such, it would be just too easy to find (& apparently many have tried datamining the game files in an effort to do so) unless it is way out on the rim of the galaxy in an unremarkable system somewhere. I dont think DB & MB would have hidden it like that. There should be a lore reason for it being hidden wherever it is, and clues from the lore to finding it. I think of the Omphalos “alien artefact” as a Harry Potter-style Portkey to Raxxla, which will be hidden on FD’s servers and only downloaded when the Omphalos is triggered.

From MB’s own words there should be a storyline to Raxxla, though we dont seem to be able to find it; that’s why we’re still talking about the disappearance of the old E/F missions from Jameson Memorial, because they were the only thing we’ve found that looked like a Raxxla storyline.
