Well, Ive had a day of chasing hypotheses, which failed. I postulated that "Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars" was a clue that Raxxla/Omphalos is hidden in a system with at least one Black Hole (Astrophel) and 2 or more Neutron Stars (Spiralling stars-plural). So I did a body search for these within 700ly of Sol and have today investigated the likeliest contenders: HIP 84111 (BH+3NS), HIP 29619 (2NS+BH) & HIP 93180 (2NS+BH). The latter was particularly interesting as there were also L, Y & T type stars in the system (Lyta Crane?? Haven't checked to see if it's in the Crane constellation from Earth...).

But I supercharged at each & every NS, tried the jump range but nothing out of the usual, dived the BHs, but nothing happened....dropped in and triple honked at all comets found...
despondency has set in!
Currently sat in cockpit of Corvette on a FC enroute to Colonia. I shall be back! (maybe )

edit: have updated my comet /body search sheet

you know it's just 701ly away.... ;-)
