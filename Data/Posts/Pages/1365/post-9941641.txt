Updated my body search sheet for Colonia. Several comets. Method again fails for several bodyids. Wouldnt have realised but spotted Colonia Orbital outpost hadnt been detected, docked there & found it as bodyid 77, those between it & Jaques crash the search....
(edit: also for Tir, ditto!)
(edit2: and ditto for Luchtaine!)
mmmmm!!!
this method needs an update, any mathematicians in the house?
may need an insight into detailed workings of ED Galmap!
