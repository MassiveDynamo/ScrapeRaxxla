Well, that is probably the next step, but Im a bit frazzled!!
If the rumour started from an inscription or whatever on the Mars Artefact it could be anywhere within maybe 2000ly-I’m assuming it’s Guardian!

Edit: though if detected by a pilot or probe early in the timeline then I expected it to be within, say, 300 ly maximum from Sol. There are a lot of systems nearby with several BH or several NS, but these were the nearest with both BH and several NS.
You saw I imagine that there's a systematic search (*) effort of every system in a 200 ly range from earth that began a few years ago?
65% done and nothing so far...
(*) It would help immensely if there was a universal methodology to apply, or a list of key points to check, by everyone in search for Raxxla so we can rule out systems for certain once searched. Alas since we're not sure what we are looking for we can't. It's like real research
