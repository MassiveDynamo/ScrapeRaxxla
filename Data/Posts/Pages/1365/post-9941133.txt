Gentlemen adventurers…yes basically elizabethan pirates…they helped establish the queens supplementary navy and bring order on the high seas, or steal a lot of Spanish gold…

Given the various references and the mention of Philip Sidney, it’s the first thing that’s comes to mind when seeing that phrase, I’ve always wondered if it’s a untrodden path in ED, could it all tie in with pirates?
