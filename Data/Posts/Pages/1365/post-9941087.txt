Shouldn't the real TDW be more inclined to exploration, lore-wise?
Yes, I pondered that codex description, but remembered that Elizabethan pirates were often described as gentlemen adventurers. Plus, I had a research session investigating galnet articles on PF and those mission possinilities all cropped up. Of course the trick might be to find the correct faction within PF!

Not sure if the rescue missions were just support for Fuel Rats, or whether it’s pukka lore...
And Holdstock originally had Raxxla populated by
“a corps of élites lives there, and are exploiting the gateway. They're powerful, twisted men.”
