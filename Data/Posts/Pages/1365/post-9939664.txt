Well, that is probably the next step, but Im a bit frazzled!!
If the rumour started from an inscription or whatever on the Mars Artefact it could be anywhere within maybe 2000ly-I’m assuming it’s Guardian!

Edit: though if detected by a pilot or probe early in the timeline then I expected it to be within, say, 300 ly maximum from Sol. There are a lot of systems nearby with several BH or several NS, but these were the nearest with both BH and several NS.
