Hello Cmdrs.
I've been running some tip off missions and i stumbled upon a server bank. Not scannable, indestructible server bank. But getting close to it i could hear in my SRV scanner some jumbled white noise and I could swear someone was saying "this is a..." before more static. After a google search I found other cmdr have already been through this. Is it a bug or a feature?
Hey there CMDR, it is a feature, you can’t scan it because you don’t have the access codes and you need them to a sess the data bank
