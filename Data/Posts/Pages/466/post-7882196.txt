Just thinking about game mechanics....that would be a good way to ensure Raxxla wasn't found by "accident". When you find the "door that is also a key" you need to unlock it with encryption code given to you by DW??? After you have unlocked them. Maybe
Nice idea but the dark wheel, from what I know, does t know where raxxla is and is trying to find it them selves. But it could be a start, usually tho you get them from mysterious stranger tip off missions
