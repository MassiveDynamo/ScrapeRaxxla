Apologies - this is way off topic.

Well honestly, 2 years after the end of the Coming of the New Messiah, I'm actually all for FDev doing something fundamental with life in the Bubble. There was much hope that the Gnosis debacle would lead to more in-game events, rather than things just happening on the Thursday tick, but that hasn't been the case. The first Interstellar Initiative was just a chained CG leading to a ferry service and a new weapon, so I don't expect this one to lead to anything significant either.

I think we've got more hope of finding Raxxla than of FDev shaking up the credit farming opportunities in the Bubble - though it WOULD be amusing if the Thargoids started treating ships full of void opals like 'we' do barnacles

Yeah, apologies for the OT from me too.

The Thargoid situation has of course been engineered by those on Raxxla to distract humanity's attention. And much to my chagrin, I've helped them.
