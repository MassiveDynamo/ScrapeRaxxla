Well after reading the leaked elite dangerous information the guy who has so far been right about everything has edited his post to say “also there is no raxxla in elite”

Technically correct.

There’s no Raxxla in Elite.

There’s also no Raxxla in FE:2 or FFE.



More to the point though, the source of the leak was apparently a technical artist. While it’s credible a technical artist would have seen the internal roadmap, how credible is it that they’d be party to Raxxla info?

More than a slight chance that the Raxxla comment was just thrown in as a bit of extra excrement agitation.
