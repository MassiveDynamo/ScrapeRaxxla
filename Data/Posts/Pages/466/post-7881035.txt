So I'm finally allied with Eurybia Blue Mafia. That was darn tedious as you get only micro missions with micro rank or missions with acceptable rank upgrade (up to 4 x +) but insystem targets that are 200k+ ls away from the central body (with max 90 minutes/night not easy).

Did anything happen? As of yet: No.
