CMDR John Jameson Crashed Site GONE!
I posted this on the PC board on accident but left it just in case it's gone there too, anyway. I was farming here last night and logged off. Woke up to patch update and logged on to this. I even left, remapped and flew around just to see if it moved. I then went back and took a screen shot...
