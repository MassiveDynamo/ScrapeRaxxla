... anyone noticed that the minor faction "The Hive" is the controlling faction in 4 systems named after the 7 Pleiades...

Their home system is Taygeta, one of the Pleiades names was Taygete.

Then they control 10 systems total, but heres the list of Pleiades names ones:

Taygeta - Mother of Sparta
Merope - Married a Mortal
Electra - Mother of the Trojans
Celaeno - Mother of the exalted rulers of the Fortunate Islands, the kingdom of the Blessed in the Greek afterlife, 2 of Poseidon's chilren

Im wondering if this has been explored and what was the outcome....

Just seems curious considering Maia's link to everything, and being a Pleiad herself, and the defacto leader of them.
Sterope, wife of Ares, isnt in game thus far, Sterope II is though.
and Alcyone, also mother to some of Poseidon's children, is a system with just a star...

Im not sure exactly how this relates, but it seems important, doesnt it?
