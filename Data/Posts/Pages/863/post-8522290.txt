CMDR John Jameson Crashed Site GONE!
I posted this on the PC board on accident but left it just in case it's gone there too, anyway. I was farming here last night and logged off. Woke up to patch update and logged on to this. I even left, remapped and flew around just to see if it moved. I then went back and took a screen shot...

What do you think the liklihood is Raxxla / DW have been wiped as well!

Not funny really.

I bet Raxxla and DW were removed many many patches ago and since no one has access it was never reported. Jameson's and Guardian site dissapearance just confirmes that that absolutely can happen.
