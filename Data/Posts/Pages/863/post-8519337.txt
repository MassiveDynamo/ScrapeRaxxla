curious if anyone knows if there is alist anywhere online, that shows the starport numbers with the stations and systems names....

Like some stations say things around the mailslot like "fps# 2692"

Im just curious because some stations have them and others dont, im wondering if they might be a missed clue, i remember I think Drew, in an old stream, mentioned maybe we should be paying attention to those numbers....

If its not been done, I was thinking of starting a google doc and begining a list as I visit the stations... would of course be open for everyone too add too...

Already discussed in this thread with FD confirmation the numbers relate just to that system e.g. number of planets etc.

Previously DB mentioned something in vid about numbers on stations. We challenged it and FD confirmed that he was talking about number stations (listening posts) and stations with numbers were all just about how the feds liked to number things...its flavour nothing more.

Shame...
