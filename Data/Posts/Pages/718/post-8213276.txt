That's not my point. When was the name placed in game or was it subsequently Hand Authored?

If MJTA was placed in 2014, only the author knows the significance since the book hasn't been published or the author is working with MB et al which is a stretch. (Edit 2: And that is with a huge assumption that MJTA is a reference to Elysian Dawn)

Edit: If it was named something else and renamed to MJTA in Dec 2018 then maybe you have something.

There are many other authors who are students of comparative mythology and have very similar storylines/easter eggs embedded in them way prior to 2014, so should we take those as priority instead?

Edit 3: If you check out this , Marianne's Journey to Arcadia in LTT 606 was already mentioned in 2016. So who copied whom, we do not know, or if even MJTA is a reference to the book... What I'm saying is that there really isn't any need to be linked, as the underlying mythology behind both instances are probably pretty similar because of comparative mythology.

Excellent point, thats my reason for posting - ask the question.

The 2018 book reference was the first thing I noticed but as Guru asked, have FD incorporated it? It is very likely circumstance, bu isnt this the purpose of this thread?

There are indeed thousands of comparative references in game, likely accidental, mostly player/author related. Its difficult to see the wood for the trees.

This may not be 'the system' but we need to rule it out. As I said I can't see any direct references to this system other than mention of Arcadia in the title.
