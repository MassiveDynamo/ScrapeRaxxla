Excellent point, thats my reason for posting - ask the question.

The 2018 book reference was the first thing I noticed but as Guru asked, have FD incorporated it? It is very likely circumstance, bu isnt this the purpose of this thread?

There are indeed thousands of comparative references in game, likely accidental, mostly player/author related. Its difficult to see the wood for the trees.

This may not be 'the system' but we need to rule it out. As I said I can't see any direct references to this system other than mention of Arcadia in the title.

From my previous post if you missed it,

"If you check out this forum thread, Marianne's Journey to Arcadia in LTT 606 was already mentioned in 2016. So who copied whom, we do not know, or if even MJTA is a reference to the book... What I'm saying is that there really isn't any need to be linked, as the underlying mythology behind both instances are probably pretty similar because of comparative mythology. "
