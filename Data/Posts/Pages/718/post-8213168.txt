Who's to say fdev didnt incorporate player made things into the riddle? Such as placing Persephone as a contact at the station for instance, or placing the Anacondas on Moel Lefn.

The codex was released Dec 2018.

That's not my point. When was the name placed in game or was it subsequently Hand Authored?

If MJTA was placed in 2014, only the author knows the significance since the book hasn't been published or the author is working with MB et al which is a stretch. (Edit 2: And that is with a huge assumption that MJTA is a reference to Elysian Dawn)

Edit: If it was named something else and renamed to MJTA in Dec 2018 then maybe you have something.

There are many other authors who are students of comparative mythology and have very similar storylines/easter eggs embedded in them way prior to 2014, so should we take those as priority instead?

Edit 3: If you check out this forum thread, Marianne's Journey to Arcadia in LTT 606 was already mentioned in 2016. So who copied whom, we do not know, or if even MJTA is a reference to the book... What I'm saying is that there really isn't any need to be linked, as the underlying mythology behind both instances are probably pretty similar because of comparative mythology.
