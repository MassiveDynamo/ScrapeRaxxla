Voices and lights in hyperspace were part of Jaques event too but so much was bumbled and handled wrong with that, that much of the lead in mystery hints were basically retconned. Including all the stuff about voices and lights.

They probably figured if Jaques event were to relate with the other 2 it would cause a lot of problems and a lot of space to cover causing us to react on how to cover 22k lys of space to find one place.
