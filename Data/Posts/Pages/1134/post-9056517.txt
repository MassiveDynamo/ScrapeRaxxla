Update 1: 1/3 of the way through the list and found one additional astronomer since original post.

So, I was bored this afternoon and thought I would take a look at part of @CMDRCorrFelian 's theory, as I knew which region of space with systems named after astronomers he was referring to. This is in that narrow band of observational bias of stars that runs through the Orion Complex, but I did not realize quite how many named systems there are out there.

I used this list: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_astronomers
and sorted it by year of birth, then checked each surname (or in some cases, like Chinese etc., full names) against the Galaxy Map. I managed to get to Frank Watson Dyson b. 1968 before getting bored of inputting names (or variations of names), which is not quite 1/3 of that list.

So far, here are the identified systems in that stretch of space, sorted by distance from Sol. They are all within 1307 and 1378 LY of Sol. I've attached a screenshot so far as well. A few cosmonauts/astronauts are also out there, I've starred them in the list below for now. That's 29 star-lovers so far (25 of them astronomers) and there are likely more. I'm assuming there is no Barnard, Herschel, Kepler, Messier, Struve, Swift or Wolf, as those are common naming systems/named sectors/nebulae, and I was too bored to cycle through all the systems starting with those names to see if there might be one that is just the surname.

That area of the map has always interested me as it sort of points to sol and has loads of named systems....

I remember going through each named system bookmarking it and googling their references, I ran out of bookmarks ;-)
