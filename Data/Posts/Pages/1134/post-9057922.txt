My basis for including an astronomer is based on what their primary focus was during their careers. Therefore, "star lover" is anyone who advanced research into stars or their various classes in any meaningful way, built catalogues of certain star types, etc. There is, in fact, a method to this process. I am not just saying this person is well known so run with it.

So I've updated the original "Astronomer System" post again here: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/page-1136#post-9055066

Still not done, but two clear outliers that don't fall anywhere near the Orion region, which is interesting, Chandra and Saha. Not sure what, if any, implications that has for the theory - if there are famous astronomer surname-only systems (i.e. "star lovers") elsewhere than the Orion observational bias area, I would think that might put a minor hole in it? If you add in the other famous outlier stars now mentioned that don't follow the naming convention of surname only (i.e. Lutyen's Star, etc.) the hole seems to be getting a bit bigger and may be taking on some water? I've excluded these latter from the list for now (but included Hawking's Reach, which doesn't follow the naming convention but is in the area) but there are a fair number of them as well (see post).
