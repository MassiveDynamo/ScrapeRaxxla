I want and encourage feedback where something doesn't fit well say so and source it. If you see holes in the fundamental logic point them out.

Just some Qs really:

Why a Triangle and not a Circle or a Pentagram or a Spiral or another shape?
You seem to pick parts of the toast as just myth / window dressing and other parts as actual map pointers? How did you decide which was real and which was just for style?
Why Ancient Greek myths at all? Why not another ancient civilisations myths like Egyptians for example? Why would DW have the slightest interest in Ancient Greek and what is the reference point that they do / did?
I like the whole thing, great tinfoil, just seems you started from one POV and made everything fit into that POV or discarded it?
Why would finding an Omphalous Rift / gateway give any more power or money to one person than mining Platinum or LTDs? Taxing or setting a toll for the gateway I can see making money but why keep it secret, what advantage is there to that? Also why would a theory described in the Codex itself as discredited be taken as more important than other things in the Codes that arent described as discredited?
