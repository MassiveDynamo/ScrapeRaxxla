My basis for including an astronomer is based on what their primary focus was during their careers. Therefore, "star lover" is anyone who advanced research into stars or their various classes in any meaningful way, built catalogues of certain star types, etc. There is, in fact, a method to this process. I am not just saying this person is well known so run with it.
Right, but my point is that Chandra and Saha fall into that category, (and others may, still not halfway through the list of astronomers) but are not in the region that you are using in your theory. How does the theory hold up if there are astronomer systems outside of the Orion region? What makes you choose an Orion area star-lover system versus one elsewhere, or exclude the latter?
