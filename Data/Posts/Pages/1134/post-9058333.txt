Strickly speaking I don't think this is match. All of the ones in that that are hits have the system named after the exact spelling of the last name of the individual (in this case his name is Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar so you'd expect to find a Chandrasekhar system but there isn't one. That being said, there are systems near Sol based off of scientific probe missions (so far found Juno, Aura, Veneres, and Tenma). This appears to be named after the Chandra X-ray Observatory that shared a shortened version of Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar's last name.

For the other individual: is this referring to Dr. Kanak Saha (primary research focus was galaxies) or Meghnad Saha (who described the conditions inside stars (he was actually a physiciist))?

Right, but my point is that Chandra and Saha fall into that category, (and others may, still not halfway through the list of astronomers) but are not in the region that you are using in your theory. How does the theory hold up if there are astronomer systems outside of the Orion region? What makes you choose an Orion area star-lover system versus one elsewhere, or exclude the latter?
