Recent LS (or more likely The Pilot interview with Arthur) said that DB will always respond to any questions / emails from him about Lore and say things like 'That person / faction wouldn't act that way', think it was in reference to the new story he and the team developed. So DB is still highly involved in the lore side and guiding it and knows exactly what he wants and what is 'allowed' or not with some higher direction in mind. Its just us that arent sure
