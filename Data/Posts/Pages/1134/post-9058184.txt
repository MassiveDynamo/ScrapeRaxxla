I'll double-check those and see where they fall .. was honestly look first and foremost of the best known astronomers. I don't suspect it will change much as the other that researched stars should give the edges of a search zone. Even if it isn't the system that FDev had in mind, then the line that must pass between that system and Delphi and would would still terminate near the target area. Keep in mind, once it goes through Delphi it goes the same distance that was solved for the radius but in exact opposite direction.

Right, but my point is that Chandra and Saha fall into that category, (and others may, still not halfway through the list of astronomers) but are not in the region that you are using in your theory. How does the theory hold up if there are astronomer systems outside of the Orion region? What makes you choose an Orion area star-lover system versus one elsewhere, or exclude the latter?
