Just a thought on this - Drew has also come out and said that "The Club" was from FD. Not his. How much of the Clubs actions were decided by who is moot at this point. Its whether FD decides to continue the story and in what way.

So, when I drop the update theory in a bit (by the way it got upgraded to v4 yesterday) it will connect to this. The knowledge of Raxxla appears to be buried by very powerful people. The initial discovery was via hyperspace probe from Sol (see early hyperspace technology tourist beacon in Tau Ceti). The authorities on Mars promptly bury it and vow to never speak of it again. Something changed either right before Birthright Wars or during but a key family to the story became privy to either the data from the hyperspace probe or something directly involving the Thargoids (but whatever it was is much deeper than just metalloys). Anyway, from the looks of things, upon the Pilots' Federation founding in 2805 I believe Polaris was very promptly permit locked. Oh yeah, and some of the last few missions in Frontier: Elite II point directly at Polaris, too.
