Iteration v4 of the Unified Theory of Raxxla (mostly complete). Iteration V4.5 will be out this afternoon with the Thargoid and Turner family connection and the actual calculation that will tie it all together. In it's current form, I have the means of deduction but still have to make the calculations (also not included are the candidates for Astrophil).

I want and encourage feedback where something doesn't fit well say so and source it. If you see holes in the fundamental logic point them out.
