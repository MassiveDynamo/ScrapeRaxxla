Do you mean this thread or something said by fdev? So far this thread is a theory, careful not to make it fact for others in the future. If fdev please link as Im relying on the FSS....even if it just says 'unresolvable' or similar so anything from Fdev will kill that idea stone dead.
this is said in the branch above, let's take this theory as a basis, it turns out just so we canâ€™t find something, we need to start some kind of mechanism. If you logically think that the dark wheel station uses a minimum of power, then the scanner simply does not pick it up, which makes it invisible to sensors
