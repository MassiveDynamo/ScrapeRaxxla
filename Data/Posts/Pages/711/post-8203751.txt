Just realised today that because The Dark Wheel player squadron I am in is pledged to The Dark Wheel faction, I can see the systems they officially have a presence in and the stations and installations they control. No new information that we canâ€™t readily check in game on the system map for Shin or LFT 926 but it is quite handy to be able to check on the faction status nice and easily like that.
