I'm on my way back to the spot right now... let me know when you're in game so I can show you.

Edit: Just got there... cmdr Koben Boettger. Send me an invite and you'll see for yourself... also you'll have to drop really close to my beacon.
Curiously the wake signal drop from SC 3 Mm away feature doesn't work there.
