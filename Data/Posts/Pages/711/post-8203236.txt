The box on the lower left side of your main screen will always display your current location... if it shows "Asteroid Belt", so you're at it... I was not targeting anything on the screenshot.

This is why I think this mechanic is relevant to find Raxxla... the Kuiper belt because according to the game lore, lots of probes were sent towards the near-by stars systems aiming to find another inhabitable planet for humankind and then started the rumors about Raxxla... as the Kuiper belt is quite on the edge of our solar system, a probe could have passed by it and sent a signal back... so we might find something inside.

I guess this is what M.Brooks meat by "a journey every player has to go through themselves"... you have a theory, go out there and test it out.

I'm actually not at the Asteroid Belt as you can see from my pic. I'm at the Sun. It shows Asteroid Belt for me because I am targetting it and it shows the epicenter at the Sun.

On the orrery, I can see I'm inside the region of the belt but I can't get the Asteroid belt wording to appear when dropping out.
