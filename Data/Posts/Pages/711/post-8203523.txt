According to the Codex, the DW station is orbiting the 8th moon of an "unnamed" gas giant... for me this means that the whole system and its main star(s) are not in the galaxy map. You'd have to know where it is, fly there and when you're close enough it might appear on your left tab screen so you can target it to jump there.

Edit: Specially considering patch notes mentioned "dark systems" yet to be discovered
