The box on the lower left side of your main screen will always display your current location... if it shows "Asteroid Belt", so you're at it... I was not targeting anything on the screenshot.

This is why I think this mechanic is relevant to find Raxxla... the Kuiper belt because according to the game lore, lots of probes were sent towards the near-by stars systems aiming to find another inhabitable planet for humankind and then started the rumors about Raxxla... as the Kuiper belt is quite on the edge of our solar system, a probe could have passed by it and sent a signal back... so we might find something inside.

I guess this is what M.Brooks meat by "a journey every player has to go through themselves"... you have a theory, go out there and test it out.
