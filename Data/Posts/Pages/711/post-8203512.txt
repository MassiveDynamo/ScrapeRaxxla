this is said in the branch above, let's take this theory as a basis, it turns out just so we canâ€™t find something, we need to start some kind of mechanism. If you logically think that the dark wheel station uses a minimum of power, then the scanner simply does not pick it up, which makes it invisible to sensors

I think it's fait to assume that biological sites don't use (or rather develop) much power either, yet the scanners pick them up. But true, me must count in the possibility that we'll have to search for the base with the naked eye, like we did for Geo and Bio sites before FSS.
