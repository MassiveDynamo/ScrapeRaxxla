please excuse me, but is it possible that you need to launch a chain of missions that will eventually lead us to a dark wheel? just relying on the latest information that some objects cannot be found by the scanner suggests certain thoughts ... We were given a toast if it is considered canon, then maybe we need to take missions from point A to point B and so on without returning back and in the end will we get somewhere?
