let's say the toast of the dark wheel is canon, we deciphered it and found out all the points let's say A B C D. Here most likely we need missions to transport goods, since they don’t seem to require returning to the starting point, though I don’t know whether legal or illegal missions are needed .. We fly to point A, take the mission and complete it at point B.
I rely on the fact that the dark wheel that is a fake, but it is not touched since the fake takes all suspicions away from the real dark wheel, which is logical.
