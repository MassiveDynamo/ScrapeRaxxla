please excuse me, but is it possible that you need to launch a chain of missions that will eventually lead us to a dark wheel? just relying on the latest information that some objects cannot be found by the scanner suggests certain thoughts ... We were given a toast if it is considered canon, then maybe we need to take missions from point A to point B and so on without returning back and in the end will we get somewhere?
The problem I have with this is what type of mission do you have to take?
It is true though that the way the mission boards are designed that it rarely gives you missions that would take you back to the previous location and by doing just random missions you would in theory end up all over the place.
If I was to take a guess I would start with a data delivery mission from the DW in SD and see where that takes you.
I will spend some time over the next few days trying that out and see where I end up. I am triple Elite and allied to the DW from the days of SAP 8 missions so I hope to qualify if that is also some sort of requirement also.
I will have to dust off my multi-roll Viper
