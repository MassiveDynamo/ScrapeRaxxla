The name LYTA CRANE is an anagram of LYT ARCANE; LYT being types of substar and arcane meaning ‘mysterious & known to few people’, which may be a clue or may be a hint that she’s talking nonsense.

(Raxxla was originally found by a group of ancient Indo-Europeans, and they adopted the name into their language. Probably the Guardian Ark ship. This probably happened in the month of Thargelion, probably somewhere around Tarshish. A bit overreaching perhaps. That is why it's the another etymological origin. My yoga instructor told me this.)
