Checked up a bit on the original Raxxla from Alien Worlds. Not cannon I know but just for giggles.
anywho the Oisir-Raxxla were an alien race from a world who were attempting to set up FTL travel to conquer the galaxy. They set up Talmor Lenses to achieve this and used generation ships to get to where they needed to set up the lenses.
the pyramids of Egypt were one set of stabilizers for a lens which failed.
the Egyptians named the Oisir-Raxxla Horus.
from this I get a couple things that seem odd. Oisir is Gaelic for oyster. The oyster nebula is NGC 1501 and sits with the Camelopardalis constellation. The Giraffe connected to the FR mystery.
Sirius also comes up via some branching and noticed that Sirius is also Sothis which is also Sopdet.
We call it Sirius, the Greeks Sothis, and the Egyptians Sopdet. All of these stars exist in elite, but they’re different stars even tho irl they’re the same star.
Triangulation maybe?
