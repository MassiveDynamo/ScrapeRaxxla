The point is reinforce pratical experimentation with documentation.

As noted, just because it happened, doesnt mean it was shared.

There was no documentation. Documentation of the tests, not only reports of results or theories is a very important aspect of science.
A lot of people will repeat the same experiments of others, creating a very long spiral of repetition without advancement.

There is a basic design principal to develop anything, such as ''solutions''
-Analysis>Theory>Prototipation>test>documentation>Analysis

It means that without proper documentation, any Analysis made after undocumented tests is expeculation.

I wonder, if it was really impossible to produce green relics before, and it became possible.
Than someone was there doing it now and found it out because the time is right.

What about those people who did try that and never recorded? Why did they never record? They kept on doing it until it worked recently?
Because that person spent time dabbling in the ''definition of insanity'' [ repeating the same process multiple times expecting diffrent results ] and got nothing.
Narrative came along and suddenly made it possible.
Seems like very unlickly. But that is the problem, it's just unconfirmed.

This is an issue for a collective analysis to develop into a theory
Leading to some of people being inclined belive that they are working alot alone in this journey

It has descriptions and documentation of most mysteries that has been solved. Very few have stayed unsolved for more tha a few weeks.

Some of the old stuff was a bit complex and required external tools, a good ear for morse code and math in a few numercal systems. These were all solved by a colective of players on the forum.
The green relic was very simple. It was just a change in the behaviour of the Thargoid machine, after the big update.
