On this topic: Has anybody here atempted their creation method before? [Green Relics]
I've seen some old videos on reddit of people shoving things on the machine, but couldnt find one with 3 relics. Probably because it was the first thing everyone tried.
I definitely played around with Relics in the machine. I can't honestly remember if I did all three...

This person did though:

Maybe tell your friend

Edit: Just in case you only watch it in the forum iframe, this vid is 5 years old, from 2017.

Edit 2: so as not to make another post:
You said "In this case he asked me why were the grelics only found right now, and I really couldn't find any evidence why."

It's because of Salvation. Details here on Canonn website.

"Admiral Tanner’s court martial was interrupted by a statement from the renowned scientist Ram Tah, confirming the non-human origins of Salvation’s superweapon. Ram Tah theorised that it was based on a Guardian device found by Azimuth Biochemicals scientists at the Proteus site, which generated an electromagnetic pulse to disrupt the Thargoids’ biomechanical vessels."

For years HIP 22460 was permit locked, it was because Salvation/Azimuth were researching a Thargoid site there. Salvation built a Guardian weapon into that Thargoid site - the site of the Proteus Wave. In response to it being fired, the Thargoids seem to somehow co-opt the pulse.

Ever since then all the surface sites (which are all linked somehow) started making Grelics - some sort of expression of whatever the Thargoid(s) did to counter the Guardian superweapon.
