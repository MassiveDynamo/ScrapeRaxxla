FYI, if it helps your friend's research, you can actually make one Grelic too in the same way that putting one relic into the Thargoid machine pre-Salvation still did the heat-build-up cycle. The only reason people tend to make 3 Grelics is because they then go sell them, so making 3 at a time is the most efficient. It doesn't require 3 relics to make the process work.

Hope that all helps you
I just took him to do a lot of things with me, that is what got him into that.
Don't think everybody goes after searching deeply for things.

I think if someone like you or many here in the forum did recent material would spark more interest in research and reading.
Like cmdr's clara and her group's recent study on the guardians language and structures.

You and a lot of people here have great content, i guess much people just watch youtube videos with many videos as the only source of information hahah
