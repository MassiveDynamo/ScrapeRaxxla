Just a quick one from you seasoned hunters if you please.
Regarding the much discussed generation ships do we know when the first mention of the Raxxla Toast was?
Obviously its in the Codex but I cant find any history of the Toast or an idea where it was first penned, im thinking of chicken and egg here, did the Toast come before the ships?

With the Toast possibly quoting events that happened on the ships (if we are right) then obviously the Toast came after?
