FYI, if it helps your friend's research, you can actually make one Grelic too in the same way that putting one relic into the Thargoid machine pre-Salvation still did the heat-build-up cycle. The only reason people tend to make 3 Grelics is because they then go sell them, so making 3 at a time is the most efficient. It doesn't require 3 relics to make the process work.

Hope that all helps you
