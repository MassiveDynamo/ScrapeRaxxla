The point is reinforce pratical experimentation with documentation.

As noted, just because it happened, doesnt mean it was shared.

There was no documentation. Documentation of the tests, not only reports of results or theories is a very important aspect of science.
A lot of people will repeat the same experiments of others, creating a very long spiral of repetition without advancement.

There is a basic design principal to develop anything, such as ''solutions''
-Analysis>Theory>Prototipation>test>documentation>Analysis

It means that without proper documentation, any Analysis made after undocumented tests is expeculation.

I wonder, if it was really impossible to produce green relics before, and it became possible.
Than someone was there doing it now and found it out because the time is right.

What about those people who did try that and never recorded? Why did they never record? They kept on doing it until it worked recently?
Because that person spent time dabbling in the ''definition of insanity'' [ repeating the same process multiple times expecting diffrent results ] and got nothing.
Narrative came along and suddenly made it possible.
Seems like very unlickly. But that is the problem, it's just unconfirmed.

This is an issue for a collective analysis to develop into a theory
Leading to some of people being inclined belive that they are working alot alone in this journey

Maidor, what you demonstrated here is actually part of the problem, so thanks for that.

Rather that doing research into what is actually a very legitimate question (i.e. was three relics tried in a Tharg machine before), communicating with those who were doing this sort of testing (like Canonn) or asking here on the forums, your friend there concocted a wild theory based entirely on their own thoughts in something of an echo chamber - they then treated their thought as if it were the truth.

That's the point of what you posted. I think really the majority of people here have done the same thing at some point

My unsolicited advice would be to tell your friend to take a deep, calming breath and join the Raxxla hunt here as an equal participant and simply converse with like-minded Raxxla hunters. Many here could have easily cleared up your friend's misunderstanding a long time ago, before it got to the stage where it became a massive angry rant - and that would free up your friends obviously very wrinkled brain to help find Raxxla!
