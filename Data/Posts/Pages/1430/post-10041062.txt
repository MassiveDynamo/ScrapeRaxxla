Brookes and Braben collaborated with other writers, including Allen Stroud, on creating a lore bible for Elite Dangerous. Allen has told us that he recognises parts of what he contributed in many Tourist Beacons, and he worked on the development of Hyperdrive Lore, the Lave system, etc. Drew Wager, despite his many faults, repeatedly told us about the cut-down lore bibles the official writers got to help them with their books - a similar document was given to the Elite RPG makers.
Brookes never was the core writer (he's important but not the core person). That was Allen Stroud. He also contributed to Elite Dangerous RPG in addition to Elite Encounters RPG. Information in the post with links to supporting evidence for what fed into the larger series (hint: Holdstock). Stroud essentially was responsible for creation of the lore bible and anything pre-3300.

Elite Dangerous's core lore person isn't Michael Brookes .. examining the breadcrumb trail of Allen Stroud
This is a repost from Independent Raxxla Hunters discord where someone had mentioned the lore stream and the fact there might be Raxxla references elsewhere. This is my response because it is has become increasingly evident Michael Brookes while instrumental in building the Elite Dangerous...
