Just a quick one from you seasoned hunters if you please.
Regarding the much discussed generation ships do we know when the first mention of the Raxxla Toast was?
Obviously its in the Codex but I cant find any history of the Toast or an idea where it was first penned, im thinking of chicken and egg here, did the Toast come before the ships?

With the Toast possibly quoting events that happened on the ships (if we are right) then obviously the Toast came after?

There is no date to when the Toast was said created, it could have been the hour before the codex entry was input all the way back to 2022, (I say 2022 as Raxxla could have been discovered just after our now relative time up to 2296)
We can go further. Not only do we not know when the toast is from, we don't even have a confirmation source of who or where it's from, only that it is "allegedly" used by the Dark Wheel. We don't know if they do, or even who alleges that they do.
