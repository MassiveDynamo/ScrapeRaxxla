Brookes never was the core writer (he's important but not the core person). That was Allen Stroud. He also contributed to Elite Dangerous RPG in addition to Elite Encounters RPG. Information in the post with links to supporting evidence for what fed into the larger series (hint: Holdstock). Stroud essentially was responsible for creation of the lore bible and anything pre-3300.

Elite Dangerous's core lore person isn't Michael Brookes .. examining the breadcrumb trail of Allen Stroud
This is a repost from Independent Raxxla Hunters discord where someone had mentioned the lore stream and the fact there might be Raxxla references elsewhere. This is my response because it is has become increasingly evident Michael Brookes while instrumental in building the Elite Dangerous...

It literally doesn't matter at all whether the Lore Bible was written by Jesus himself or whether it was written by a million monkeys hitting keys at random.

The relevant information is that it exists and trying to reconstruct it by literally going through the in-game lore and putting it back together might be a viable path to finding clues.

You're continually derailing this thread with utterly pointless "umm... actually" posts, most of which you're either wrong about or just gibbering insanely about stuff that doesn't even make sense at all.

I'm going to block you, congrats on being literally the first and only person I've ever blocked in this thread and the second only person I've ever blocked on this entire forum in nearly 6 years.
