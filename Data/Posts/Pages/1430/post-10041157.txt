It literally doesn't matter at all whether the Lore Bible was written by Jesus himself or whether it was written by a million monkeys hitting keys at random.

The relevant information is that it exists and trying to reconstruct it by literally going through the in-game lore and putting it back together might be a viable path to finding clues.

You're continually derailing this thread with utterly pointless "umm... actually" posts, most of which you're either wrong about or just gibbering insanely about stuff that doesn't even make sense at all.

I'm going to block you, congrats on being literally the first and only person I've ever blocked in this thread and the second only person I've ever blocked on this entire forum in nearly 6 years.

Seriously? I gave you guidance on how the story was written so you have some reasonable approach to deducing what we are searching for. It isn't like I refused to help.

TL; DR: In the things that are obscured you will find small pieces that help to put together a more complete picture. Like a collapsing nebula becoming a star, light comes from the dark. Searching the light for light will not help you in your quest.
