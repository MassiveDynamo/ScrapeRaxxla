Ah ha!
Clear evidence of misdirection!
And only a glancing reference to Raxxla, 14th word on page 58 in chapter 6 of his 455 page book!
And yet visiting coordinates of all possible combinations of the numbers in all four quadrants, still no Raxxla!
Yet I see many have been there.boo
Suspicious absence indeed!

Don't all Cthulhu stories end with the gate opened and "Say anyone notice an off switch?"

Wow, only ONE mention of Raxxla in his book? I don't have any of the books, I'd be grateful if you'd share the sentence with us (won't help us find it, just curious).
