The Crystalline Forest is from the 2.2 launch video. Here you go: https://youtu.be/iojsbuOzEuQ?t=32

Oh I've always wondered what the Crystalline Forest is. That's so strange - Canonn call them Alien Tube Worrms (http://www.sagittarius-eye.com/canonn-seeks-alien-tubeworms-on-mysterious-planet/) They're doing a search for them literally right now!

I was expecting "crystalline forest" to be blue crystals (because obvs space crystals have to be blue )
