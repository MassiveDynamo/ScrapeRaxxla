I've been reading about previous Elite games again today, about various rumours and mysteries there used to be back then. Dredgers, 9th galaxy, generation ships, thargoid ships etc. Treasure hunting in outdated looking websites, searching for antique discussions about old mysteries. Gives great context for thought, and a certain contrast. Those were times when Elite Dangerous was still the upcoming Elite IV, if even that. The Raxxla we have in Elite Dangerous would most likely have been decided upon that time. I think it will be something simpler, attuned to the Elite series, and possibly never truly found.

I think I've seen the FSD operating beyond safety limits message before, in some neutron star/white dwarf system inside the bubble. Non-procedurally generated system. I don't think it's important, and could be replicated elsewhere.

The crystalline forest thing is a odd one, I have this, possibly a false memory, of seeing something unusual in a picture or somewhere, and have tried to search for information regarding it without success, a few times actually. It is being mentioned rarely. Confusion to barnacle sites seems obvious of course. I fear it's something they showed during some event, or expo, and then forgot about. I really hope Canonn succeeds in finding "alien tubeworms", in a way that would confirm there are things worth searching for.

The Crystalline Forest is from the 2.2 launch video. Here you go: https://youtu.be/iojsbuOzEuQ?t=32

I've tried to link to the right spot in the trailer, but if it doesn't work for some reason it's at 32 seconds.

The subject gets discussed on the Geyser and Fumarole location thread periodically. Examples of the other known types of organic sites get found reasonably often, but no one's reported finding the Crystalline Forest yet.


I also get the random FSD Operating Beyond Safety Limits message in other systems, not just Sirius.
