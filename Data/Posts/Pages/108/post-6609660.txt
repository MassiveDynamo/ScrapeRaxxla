I had this happening from time to time in the Bubble ( never in the last 65 KLy en route to BP with a lot of WD systems ). The warning included this biohazard hull attack-thing. For me just one more bug... unless, just like happened with the Rift mYsTeRy, I am taking clues for bugs and bugs for clues.
Polaris would be in the outer rim of ...what ?
