Hey all.

Disclosure: I am totally convinced Polaris is system Raxxla is located in.

Question is how to get the permit.

I am intrigued by this observation that users get repeated warning that FSD is operating over safety limits when SC'ing in Sirius system. Some users state this happens in other systems, so a few questions on this. Have any of you guys noticed this happening in systems where super charging your FSD is invalid i.e. no White Dwarf or Neutron?

Further, is anyone aware of whether a bug has been raised ab out this? It sounds as if it's a bug to me and would obviously put this whole thought train to bed if they said it was a bug. Likewise, if Frontier confirmed this message is triggering as expected that is a legitimate lead..?

I've been to Polaris several times in FFE. If Raxxla is there, it's well hidden within the system.
Polaris was more of a Thargoid nest with two terrestrial Ammonia worlds, back then.

If Raxxla is in Polaris, there is more to it than getting the permit.
