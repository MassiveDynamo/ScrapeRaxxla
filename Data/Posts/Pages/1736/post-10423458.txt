O7 good point, I have included it.

Personally I suspect FD have just retconned the narrative and left the DW and Raxxla flouting around in space waiting to be found.

If it’s narrative and yet to be unlocked then putting in a Codex is redundant as FD keep narratives under tight wraps, and they opt to nerf than fix, so I suspect in less than more. Plus, FD have stated several times it’s in game, granted it’s still inconclusive but there’s at least one definitive video where they recount on our inability to find it: something like ‘they can’t even find Raxxla!’

So I hazard the guess after a certain period any historical narrative was all incorporated and retconned, so aspects like invites and our standing within the DW / PF technically a moot point.

My emphasis was to try and understand the text and observe the new data as intelligence.

The codex was inserted intentionally at a certain point following a mission retconning; any new data cannot simply be irrelevant, if it is then such an action is a redundant exercise, a simple comms announcement would have sufficed, but no they turn it into something and use it. That’s what businesses should do, recoup their investment and rebrand.

So for most part I feel the Codex are a redux, but with new data thrown in to sow the missing threads together an give a shorthand explanation. If that is so what (if anything) does this limited new data say?

Personally I am going off the suspicion that Brookes did the opposite of what he said in that interview, I feel everything he did in game is in some part a clue to something else, nothing exists in game in isolation. Especially his book Legacy - which very likely is being referred to in the codex.
