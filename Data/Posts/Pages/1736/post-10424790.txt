The are semi-persistent NPC ships which do spawn in certain systems. I cannot confirm if these ‘names’ are specific to certain systems or if they spawn randomly everywhere. But I do have experience of seeing such entities repeatedly occurring and travelling the same routes. I thought it a cool concept, but it could easily be due to some naming catalogue.
