O7 good point, I have included it.

Personally I suspect FD have just retconned the narrative and left the DW and Raxxla flouting around in space waiting to be found. If it’s narrative and yet to be unlocked then putting in a Codex is redundant as FD keep narratives under tight wraps, and they opt to nerf than fix, so I suspect less than more.

FD Devs stated in a public video how players were so poor at finding things especially Raxxla (can’t find that vid but it happened) something like ‘they can’t even find Raxxla!’

So I hazard the guess it’s a retcon, and includes your point about us all aready being in the DW, as likewise I believe the invite no longer exists.

No. I don't think we're in TDW. We're in one of the factions within PF, the one that's on the outer rim & open to all. TDW is a separate faction within PF which I think we were supposed to uncover and join (IIRC one is by killing Thargoids, one by rescuing passengers from destroyed stations, Davanix said he had allied with another). However I suspect that is no longer possible and we're intended to use MB's remaining clues: the codex, the in-game cosmology, the TB etc to discover the Easter egg- Raxxla.

And I suspect it's a lot less difficult than most of us have been making it, if you have eyes to see!
