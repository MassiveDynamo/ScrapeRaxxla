I don’t think Jacques is TDW. He was never a Pilot.
Mmm, from the codex
"The Dark Wheel is the name given to a legendary group of adventurers, explorers,
investigators and treasure-hunters"...strictky speaking no mention of them having to be pilots, or elite.

I suspect Jacques is so old and knowledgeable that he will know of TDW, and might well be a member...he's certainly an adventurer & explorer, and he flies his own station!

I remember one TB mentioned a Jameson daughter ( "existing members covertly training their children"...), an explorer, crashing into a planet/moon...is this a clue we've ignored? The Jameson's were almost certainly TDW imo.

(Edit: found it in my notes: "3163 Naomi Jameson, Peter’s daughter the explorer, crashed into a planet in the Zearla system while chasing a comet and bankrupted the family in the process")
