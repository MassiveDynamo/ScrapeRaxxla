Delphi was named late. It got the name when the anti Xeno activity started. Before that. it was a generic Pleades sector system.

Thor's Eye is named by the galactic mapping project, so it's basically player named.

Ahhh sneaky - didnt realize thors eye was player named! Thanks!

Ya i still wonder about Delphi though - i suspect it is just pointing out the importance of the Pleiades and Meropeâ€¦
