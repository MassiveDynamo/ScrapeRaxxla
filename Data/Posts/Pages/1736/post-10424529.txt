Just thinking about our soon to be new ship the Mandalay

Its both named after a snake (expected) but also Frontier indicated they took inspiration from the Lightning aircraft… snake and lightning…. Mother Goddess and Thunder god.

Also the name Mandalay instantly recalls the poem by Kipling. Very much a Wanderlust…
