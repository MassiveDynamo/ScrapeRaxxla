IIRC the codex symbol/logo for Jacques bears a resemblance to TDW....

Could Jacques station be that of TDW which he commandeered?

However I've visited it several times & not seen a hint of anything out of the ordinary...TOHF perhaps to trigger something?
I donâ€™t think Jacques is TDW. He was never a Pilot.
