Ya i think Odins Wisdom and Thors Eye are both some kind of sign posts…

Delphi probably too - i cant remember if it was part of that initial pleiades resource string of systems…. Or a little later. I think a little later but will need to check.
Delphi was named late. It got the name when the anti Xeno activity started. Before that. it was a generic Pleades sector system.

Thor's Eye is named by the galactic mapping project, so it's basically player named.
