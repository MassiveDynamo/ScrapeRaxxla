Today while in the 'Cubeo' system , near 'Medupe City' , i tracked an 'Aisling Guardian' ( Diamondback Scout ) ship named 'CHILD' .
At the time i was unfortunately hectic post-interdiction ( cuz of delivery cargo mission ) and without shields , so was rushing to land at starport to dump cargo before another interdiction. But i still managed to take a screenshot , with PRNT SCRN button ...but then like a total newb i forgot to paste it before copy/paste'ing another separate EliteD forum link. So the photo was lost somewhere in computer Windows cache/memory i dunno. UGH sorry.

But i'm positive the intel & name is accurate because it just happened like a few minutes ago. However, i'm not even sure this info is relevant nor helps any of u guys searching for *RAXXLA * here. Just figured i'd post it anyway just in case.
It's probably too late now, but in Windows 10 + 11 you can use WINDOWS KEY + V for pasting earlier items on the clipboard. A little notification window will show with the past items copied.
If you don't have it active, search for "Clipboard History" in Windows Settings to activate it. It has saved me a few times already.
