Something must have happened, or have been happening, around the end of the 21st Century that would make the entire population of Earth believe the only solution was to leave the Sol system entirely and focus a massive effort of developing a space-industry entirely devoted to building thousands of ships to carry as many people away from Sol as possible.

What could possibly make an entire population believe that, for potentially decades or centuries? Remember the ships were sent in different directions.
Well, AI is banned in E: D universe...
