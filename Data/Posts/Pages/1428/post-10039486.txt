Hate replying to myself, but the more I think about this, the more sense it makes. If some corporations enjoy major political influence due to their extreme wealth, and the concept of space exploration is popular in public opinion, the money spent these endeavours could be insignificant in compared to any loss in influence they might experience in a regime change.

It would be good PR for the company, and if desire to be part of it was high enough, they could even run lotteries for places on the ships to recoup at least some of the costs.
It is a really good point

I think it seems to fall into the "Why would anyone invest with no returns". Job creation schemes still yield results for the investor, or society as a whole. Also, we're talking about post WW3 Earth here, there would be plenty of work to do rebuilding for at least decades if not generations, after that, why make Gen ships and not simply Sol-based space industry?

Sol-based space stations would require a similar work level to Gen ships, but you'd retain your investment. You'd create more jobs making space stations in Sol (which in themselves could spawn more industry around them) than you would making Gen ships.

With Gen ships you're literally sending your investment away permanently, there's no payoff other than pure altrusim for future generations - Edit: So you're basically losing money ever Gen ship you make, permanently, even if the PR or placement lottery paid some of the costs. In a business sense, it doesn't seem to add up.

At least, not for it to be done 70,000+ times when there are better options (like making Sol-based space stations)
