Hate replying to myself, but the more I think about this, the more sense it makes. If some corporations enjoy major political influence due to their extreme wealth, and the concept of space exploration is popular in public opinion, the money spent these endeavours could be insignificant in compared to any loss in influence they might experience in a regime change.

It would be good PR for the company, and if desire to be part of it was high enough, they could even run lotteries for places on the ships to recoup at least some of the costs.
Have you ever heard of Saud Kruger? They make the Astrogator Console you use to fly your ships and were the company the predated Universal Cartographics having started the centralized exploration databases. The also run a fabulously profitable way to recoup lost expenses - tourism services. Changes had to be made to ensure legitimacy of the data which is why naming schemes for systems and cartographics data were centralized under Universal Cartographics.
