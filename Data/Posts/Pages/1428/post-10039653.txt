That could be true but I have absolutely no idea how that relates to what I'm talking about right now But I know you think there's a connection, so can you try to explain the connection you're seeing here in terms my stoopid brain might actually understand? Preferably without mentioning previous games or books by Holdstock
Mic Turner history beacon established the religious/esotericism connection as it was required to decode which of the four Jones Colony was his home (it is Jones Colony, Yamatri). The explanation is long and complicated but Amiay, Ququve, and Zelada and the events connected to Veliaze Incident reinforced this by connected the religious organization tied to Mars and Beta Hydri (which is home to Black Mausoleum which is also a memorial to the Ryders who have been lost). When I do a dedicated Dark Wheel thread it will be explained more thoroughly. Understanding Essafa was part of connecting in the ideas of esotericism and shibboleths.
