Well, I am headed back out on the quest. I am thinking of heading back toward Barnard's on a slower tour this time to see what I can find. I feel I was a little to fast in my travels on the Bubble to Barnard's mission and want to revisit a lot of those places, as well as find some new ones. Willl eventually head for the Inra sites again as well.
