The PF didn't exist until hundreds of years after the period we're discussing here (founded in 2800), I've no idea what your reply even means?

We're talking about the proto-Federation. Literally Earth and Luna. Tau Ceti wasn't even colonised until the 2150s, 50 years after the first Generation ships left Earth.
The Pilots' Federation is founded by The Dark Wheel which goes all the way back to Sol (link here is Essafa was actually a place on Earth - Essafa, Syria - which also established the esotericism connection via the Druze). They are probably the same ones who made off with the Tesla and Spaceman before departing Sol. The Dark Wheel runs literally everything. They are also apparently a religious group given the locations of the Revised Catholic Mission (Aymiay, Beta Hydri, and Mars (Sol)) and behind The Prophet, The Sanctum, and Church of the Path. Yes, The Dark Wheel and the cult are one and the same. The Black Mausoleum and other "white houses of communion" are their sanctuaries and holy sites. This is why everything is hidden via esoteric references.

NOTE: I know the anchor quotes for Wikipedia are likely needing a fix. Will edit in a bit and probably start a dedicated Dark Wheel thread. Posted from mobile and I'm sorry
