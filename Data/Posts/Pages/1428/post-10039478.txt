Without trying to get too political, I would argue that the fleet contruction initiatives could have just been a type of job creation scheme. Never underestimate the lengths corporate/monied interests will go to to quell a potentially popular anti-capitalist uprising.

If something like that was on the cards on Earth, it could have been done as a distraction. Make sure the unemployed don't exist in high enough numbers to be an unstoppable force.

I'm not arguing this is the case, just suggesting alternatives.
Hate replying to myself, but the more I think about this, the more sense it makes. If some corporations enjoy major political influence due to their extreme wealth, and the concept of space exploration is popular in public opinion, the money spent these endeavours could be insignificant in compared to any loss in influence they might experience in a regime change.

It would be good PR for the company, and if desire to be part of it was high enough, they could even run lotteries for places on the ships to recoup at least some of the costs.
