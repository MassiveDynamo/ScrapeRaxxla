I could see why folks would go on the Gen ships (though not sure of the motive to fund them), there's just been a huge War and suddenly your offered an opportunity for a new start or just a way out of the turmoil, a chance for a piece of land of your own (again not sure if folks paid to board the ships) not dissimilar to those who left the UK for America when it was discovered.
