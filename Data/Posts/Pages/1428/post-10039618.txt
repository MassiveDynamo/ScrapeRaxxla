The Pilots' Federation is founded by The Dark Wheel which goes all the way back to Sol. They are probably the same ones who made off with the Tesla and Spaceman before departing Sol. The Dark Wheel runs literally everything. They are also apparently a religious group given the locations of the Revised Catholic Mission (Aymiay, Beta Hydri, and Mars (Sol)) and behind The Prophet, The Sanctum, and Church of the Path. Yes, The Dark Wheel and the cult are one and the same. The Black Mausoleum and other "white houses of communion" are their sanctuaries and holy sites. This is why everything is hidden via esoteric references.
That could be true but I have absolutely no idea how that relates to what I'm talking about right now But I know you think there's a connection, so can you try to explain the connection you're seeing here in terms my stoopid brain might actually understand? Preferably without mentioning previous games or books by Holdstock
