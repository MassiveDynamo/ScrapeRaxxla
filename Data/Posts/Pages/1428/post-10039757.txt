I could see why folks would go on the Gen ships (though not sure of the motive to fund them), there's just been a huge War and suddenly your offered an opportunity for a new start or just a way out of the turmoil, a chance for a piece of land of your own (again not sure if folks paid to board the ships) not dissimilar to those who left the UK for America when it was discovered.

See that bit doesn't quite sit right with me. It's like European countries in 1946 up and starting to send daily rockets to the moon. With what industrial capacity, hmm? If you have the means of producing stuff like this and supplying the means for them to be at least plausibly self-sustaining, what exactly do that many people have motivation to leave this land of plenty for?
