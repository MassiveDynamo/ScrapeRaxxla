found something like a logo.... it is painted on the container of generations ship

That reminds me of something. The geometry for a hexagon is the 2 dimensional reprentation of a cube. Could this represent a sector? We have a cube sector at col 70 and barnads nebula.

And I just got a mysterious message from a stranger. We have rumors or tests for TDW. Maybe they are related. And even if they are related to criminal gangs. Those criminal gangs could easily be underground TDW organization like the mafia or something. Forgot what else I was going to say.

Great Rift (astronomy) - Wikipedia

I think this. someone posted this back at some point in here. I've been meaning to explore. Could this be the rift it's talking too. There is that odd set of stuff that is an alternative name to omphalis or something. Ophiucus?! I could be mistaken about that. There was another system with a name related to this in the bubble. But I can't remember what it was. This is on my list of exploration stuff. But I have to do the systems from the original game first. I found there are 31ish from the first galaxy and 1 confirmable one from galaxy 2. So far the rest don't have direct names but some have odd alternatives from search results that have nothing to do with the name being searched. So far so oddly off I wonder if it's not on purpose. I have a list I'm going over. Although I still have to search for galaxy 5-8 to confirm no direct names.

Also, has anyone noticed that the princess and the imperator is not viewable. Could this be coincidental? Is princess related to the codex. Can anyone else read it. Maybe they are hiding subtle clues in news reports to stuff.
