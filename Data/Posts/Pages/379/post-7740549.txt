This is already in the codex and little in the tourist beacons - once it appeared in the codex, it means that it is already in the game. And if we have already found the The Dark Wheel, besides their secret station ((possibly up to the Horizons their station was in space) although their base is on the eighth satellite of the gas giant, which revolves around an M-class nameless star. The only thing that the base is on the planet, and not in space and if you become an ally for them, they will start giving you secret tasks), then Raxxla is already there. Perhaps at the initial stage, this does not make much sense, but if the public will show interest in this type of occupation in the game, the developer will add different riddles and additions. Codex - it`s a key for new player, how to find the Dark Wheel. But Raxxla is still a problem for old players

By the way, how is Shinrarta Dezhra translated from other languages? (some kind of jewel, no?)

That has been discussed in this thread, but quite a while ago. If I remember correctly “Shinrarta Dehzra” is a mix of Russian and Arabic and translates to something like “life, she saw, hope”. It was named by a quickstarter/backer whose name I forget, but if you find my previous post I had the reference to his explanatory post on this. It may (or may not) be worth noting that DB and MB then seemed to treat this as a matter of secrecy.
