It's been pointed out in past pages, I believe. Raxxla codex mentions Omphalos RIFT, and I did look through the codex for Universal Cartographics for some sort of rift or split within the company. But they only thing I saw was the name of the CEO, Cynthia whatever, which may be significant but doesn't seem to have any other mentions anywhere else Raxxla-related.

Omphalos Rift is in the same paragraph as Astrophel and Stella, and there was a discussion in the past about Stella's name, which isn't actually spelled out in the sonnets as far as I could see, so maybe we could substitute Cynthia whatever in place of it.

The only other interpretation for Omphalos Rift that I have is, if Omphalos is the company that provided the encryption / data security protocols, the Rift could be a code hack, security breach, or password / cipher decoding mechanism. It's still just vague clues, though, because none of the texts mention ciphers or codes; we're only looking at codes because we know E is a game.

Thanks for the heads up, I figured that might be the case

It's also been said, somewhere, that TDW is a conglomeration of multiple corporations these days so it may not be wise to completely dismiss the possibility that some of these 'players' (as in agents) still have ties to the myth and may become integral to the narrative going forwards, as FDev rolls it out...

Exciting stuff, to keep the CMDR with everything occupied. Game on!
