If you read the report, they triangulated that to "somewhere inside the space formed by these 5 neighboring stars", and there isn't a system there, so we can't jump to it, so basically dead end.

I don't think anyone wants to try supercruising 4 LY to see if their "you are here" icon moves off the main star, on the map.
