I have this in a document. Having problems with alt tabbing because of wine/linux atm. It has the full list(non reduced) of the systems I've check with galmap in game. These are the end results of 1-4. Haven't done 5-8 yet.

Underline means direct result. Non underline means no direct result but get some odd result. * is a bit reduntant and means multiple results in gal map. This can apply to both of the previous.

You'll note that so far only galaxy 1 and 2 have any systems represented. And only one from galaxy 2.

I was also planning on making a list of all searches producing more than one result or a result besides the text given. And list all results. From the ones I've done I think only 2 are very far from the bubble. They are near colonia. The results are very weird when it comes to non given results. It's so odd I wonder if it's on purpose. It doesn't make search as a general result for name base search. So, is it on purpose?! If not it may help understand the galmap search function better to understand the game.

Quickest way to search: double click name to get it to highlight. CTRL-C. Alt tab into game. Have galmap open and click the search bar or hit spacebar to speed this up potentially. Hit CTRL-V. Hit enter or click the triangle to search. Search as needed. Alt tab to document. Use(or make) shortcut to strikethrough. rinse repeat!

I won't be able to search more until wine/linux/vram limitations stop making it impossible for me to alt tab. 8)
