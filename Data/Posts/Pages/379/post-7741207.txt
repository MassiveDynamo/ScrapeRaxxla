Google better bro...

Shinrarta was named by CMDR Liqua? and its supposedly a mix of Russian and Arabic. Last seen in his signature I think, you might want to check it out. The explanation itself should still be in the forums.

I should have Googled my own post on this, but instead I tried to use the forum/thread search engine which came up totally zero. This is not my first failed search attempt in this new forum structure. Hope messages were not deleted during the transfer to the new forum, there is a lot of effort recorded in this thread!!

Edit: Iâ€™ve just spent a while trying to find with Google my original post on this; also a failure. So have we been censored? Are FD trying to hide a clue in the meaning of Shinrarta Dehzra? Is the meaning of life still 42???
