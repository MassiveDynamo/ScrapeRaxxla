Wish I could help in actual real search, but right now on the DW2 Expedition and I just highly doubt it's out here in this direction. I'm trying to catch up to everyone near WP 11. When I get back to the "Bubble" I'm going to really put my head into it.
I saw you last night, CMDR...good ways behind the fleet. Here's to safely catching up for the weekend. See you out there. o7
