Google better bro...

Shinrarta was named by CMDR Liqua? and its supposedly a mix of Russian and Arabic. Last seen in his signature I think, you might want to check it out. The explanation itself should still be in the forums.

This one?

"Shinrarta Dezhra" was named by me, and is an amalgamation of Russian and Arabic:
Russian (zhizn' [жизнь] meaning "Life")
Arabic (ra'at [رات] meaning "she saw")
Russian (nadezhda [надежда] meaning "Hope")

a little wrong, he(she) tried to say: "In life, she saw hope." OK. Good words. But...then it will not help us in any way with Raxxla
