Well, downloaded the EDO update, twice, cos when I'd spent 30 mins downloading at 18;00 (it said "Update" and EDO was listed at the top!) I then got "Install" which I then did- over 2 hours download!
Logged off the PC and revalidated....
But still cant connect to the server to make my first footfall!!!

Edit: Aha, this looks promising...
but alas an edlessly spinning ship icon with some really annoyingly unhelpful tips!!

aAnd...connection error, Taupe Cobra

Annd the network connection's up again

Aand, endlessly rotating ship icon... and network connection gone again...connection error, Taupe Cobra
Think those servers need some WD40 and maybe an extra couple of cooling fans??

looking at Task Manager my network is 0%, but GPU maxing at 100%. WIll lower resolution!!

dropped from usual 4K down to 1920x1080....GPU at 97+%...connection error Orange Cobra
