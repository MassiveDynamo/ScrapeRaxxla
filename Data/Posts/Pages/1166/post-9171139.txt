Technically it would be the seed that generated the Galaxies wouldn't it? Now Stellar Forge but not then.

Ya I was looking into that a bit earlier - RNG - "randomius factorio" the god of creation but was focusing on the names and descriptions of the systems - How they weren't truly random and especially Galaxy 1 - it was crafted.... the others were just imperfect copies ..... Reminds me - I wish they had implemented RNG descriptions of systems instead of leaving them mostly blank and letting idiot playergroups put stuff in there...
