Frontier are trolling me, I have a friend in CQC right now on XB but I cant even get past the main menu and hes invited me to the game about 8 times to see if that works. You better need Elite CQC for Raxxla after all this
Nah, CQC came into game well after Raxxla.
But you might just need a supercomputer with Brain-the-size-of-a-planet AI-powered graphics card to play EDO
Aaand a direct satcom network link to Cambridge UK.
