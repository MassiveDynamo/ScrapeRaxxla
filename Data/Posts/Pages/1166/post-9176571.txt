Well I got months to dig a tunnel and lay a cable directly into their Servers, like the CIA did to the KGB ones in Berlin. Itll be quicker than waiting for fibre where I live anyway.
Eee, when ah were a lad all we ad wus too tin cans an a piece o wet string!
None o this superfast kabel stuff!
Mind, t’wet string did make ower paper bag that we lived in a bit soggy!
Sadly turns off EDO and starts to play D’vorrrshak's New World Symphony by t’Ashington Colliery brass band
