New Horizons probe is in Sol (was there last night). FDev officially announced it was in the game in April 3304. Not sure if it was added around then or the got tired of waiting and were pushing the players to find it. The major commonality is they all had a flyby at Jupiter. I think the Voyagers were there since the beginning but I have no proof either way on New Horizons.
I believe it was added as a tribute to the New Horizons team at the time, and was found shortly after as it was put out on social media IIRC.
