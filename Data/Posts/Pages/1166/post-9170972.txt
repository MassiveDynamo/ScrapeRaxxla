Nice one.

Both the Lave -Leesti line and the Riedquat - Reorte line (opposite direction of the Zurara) look quite parallel.

Riedquat - Reorte is a little less that 3 min off. I'll have to check the Leesti - lave line properly.

Ya will play around with these this evening.

This seems like the best candidate yet for that line !
