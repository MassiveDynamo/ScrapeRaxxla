FDev just posted on twitter asking what players favorite mystery in Elite was. In the lower left of the image of the interceptor is the text "hesperus" in morse. This seems to be a reference to venus is sol as there does not appear to be a system or station with that name. The people on twitter don't seem to have noticed it yet. It might be a player image that fdev reused without noticing the faint graphic, but when they do that they usually credit the player who took the screen shot. Also may not be Raxxla related, but seems worth checking out regardless.

Currently burning for sol on the other monitor.
Good catch - though i detest twitter

Might think about the Wreck of the Hesperus as well... didnt see any Normans Woe... but there is a Normans Folly in Guanggi...
