And what’s/when’s the new book??
AHTW was a good read; I’m always on the lookout for similar calibre reading material!
Edit: anybody know how to turn off the forum auto correct mis-spelling expert idiot on iPad?
John Harper's upcoming book is called "The Bezerker" (yes, no r) unless his working title has changed. I believe he has it, or part of it anyways, in with a publisher now, so hopefully Soon (tm MB). My understanding is it is sci-fi in a universe of his own design that he has been sketching out for some years now.
