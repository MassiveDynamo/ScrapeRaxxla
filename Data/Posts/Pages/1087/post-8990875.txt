That would be AWESOME ! Would love to see the Dubious Profit make an appearance !!!

Edit: Although Im starting to wonder if its a hint that the Galactic Summit is in for some unwelcome visitors... (Not just Archon Delane)
It's ripe for a pluckin'!!! I actually can't imagine it without, seems inevitable... should be fun!
