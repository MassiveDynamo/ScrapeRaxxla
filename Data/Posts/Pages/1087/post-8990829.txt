I'm putting my money down for a CG of rescuing a generation ship from Thargoid onslaught... fingers crossed on a Thargoid mothership in-systems and capital ships from Fed / Emp responding.

Or perhaps there is a more lengthy storyline afoot in Elite, eh Mr Drew Wagar?

The Trumble Salesman from the SS. Hesperus – A homage to the cowardly feline character from Oolite fiction, Commander Hesperus, who flies a very ramshackle Python called the “Dubious Profit” crewed by an mad crew of Lizards, Birds and Insectoids and who makes his living by flogging trumbles to the anyone he can con into buying them.


might need to mobilise to investigate more closely ...

Fly Dangerously,

That would be AWESOME ! Would love to see the Dubious Profit make an appearance !!!

Edit: Although Im starting to wonder if its a hint that the Galactic Summit is in for some unwelcome visitors... (Not just Archon Delane)
