Might think about the Wreck of the Hesperus as well... didnt see any Normans Woe... but there is a Normans Folly in Guanggi...

Visited both Venus (Sol) and Lucifer (Sirius) and found the following:
Venus - Megaship transporting some gold and common resources;
Lucifer - Persistent Distress Call with 3 pirates in the instance;

Also docked at the stations orbiting both Venus and Lucifer and didn't find any message.

So... yeah... I'm out of ideas on what to make from the morse code message "Hesperus"
