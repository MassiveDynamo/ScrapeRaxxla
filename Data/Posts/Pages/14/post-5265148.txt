From what drew described, makes sens that its either in the bubble, or within a reasonable proximity to the bubble. Seeing as Polaris is permit locked, and is not that far from the inhabited bubble, could this be relevant? I'm not sure of any other permit locked siongle systems in the area (Single system locked - not a whole region)
