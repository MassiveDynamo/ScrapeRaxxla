Wonder if Col-70 lockout get's lifted with next patch (In beta it's listed as restricted/closed, no longer unknown permit required). Might me get some new clues? the sector fits with the current line of thinking no? reasonably close to the bubble? Also in whats turning out to be a very mysterious part of the galaxy... thoughts?
