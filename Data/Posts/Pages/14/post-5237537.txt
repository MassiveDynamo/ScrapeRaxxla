I would be very surprised if Raxxla was in the Formidine Rift. I honestly don't know where it is myself, but it is unlikely to be that far away IMHO. It was known about hundreds of years ago when long range space travel was much more tedious. I have a feeling it's not too far from the core worlds, or there's a route to it that's not far from the core worlds.

Cheers,

Drew.
