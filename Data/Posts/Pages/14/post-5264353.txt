The inhabited bubble has been scanned and explored a hundred times over, if it was there it would have to be a moving rouge planet (although drew has confirmed that the book in which that's mentioned is not cannon), or some kind of device as Alex suggested. If it was just outside the inhabited bubble (maybe in a sphere with the radius of sol to Merope?), then there's a change it might still be an undiscovered planet or moon, or even discovered and just unnoticed. Either way, I assume we can rule out any inhabited systems, as it wouldn't make sense for this huge secret to be in a place traveled by thousands or millions a day.
