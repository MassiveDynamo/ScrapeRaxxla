People have tried to make the Dark Wheel the controlling faction before (Fact: They were highly successful) but alas, because The Pilots Federation is in said system Frontier has it set up so the Dark Wheel can't take over (Likely because if the Pilots Fed. lost control of their system...well, that's a GalNet war with the DW) unfortunately.

Sorry to break it too ya, but the Dark Wheel will never control Dezhra until the Devs allow it, and that also means no expansion.

When did they last try? There were several systems over a year ago that seemed impossible to flip and it turned out to be entirely related to bugs in the BGS. It might be worth giving it another try.
