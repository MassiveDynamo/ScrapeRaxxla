In the story "Darkness Falls" they describe Raxxla as an ELW with a construct orbiting it. On one side is the gate, and on the other side of the planet is the generator. All Elites from that bar fly there to destroy it and succeed.

I hope it's not behind a permit locked system, although very well possible.
