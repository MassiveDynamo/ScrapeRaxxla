Some thoughts about the "Dark Wheel" missions (sorry for the followed words, I'll quote Drew Wagar from memory, I have no links, but I guess Drew could confirm).

1 Drew said few times (the most recent was when he was a guest the BroCast of Josh Hawkins, a CoR was also guested by Josh but I don't remember who) that Raxxla could be found by everyone in the game, which mean that is not necessary to be Elite to find evidences or clues, nor having Horizon. Then, Raxxla is not settle on a planet, it must be in space.

2 He also said that it could be found ingame, which also means that all we need to find Raxxla is ingame, even the tools.

3 Drew said that Raxxla could be found by Brute Force method but it would be very hard in that way (he also said that lonewolf could find it too). On the other hand, he said that Raxxla was not a particular place we could find like an USS or so.

4 He said that Raxxla would be obvious when we'll have all the pieces of the puzzle in our hands (maybe we could have Raxxla in front of our eyes from the begining but we didn't know that because we didn't understand WHAT is Raxxla exactly, as we didn't have all the pieces of the puzzle in our hands).

5 Finaly, he said that Raxxla could be found by chance by anyone, alone or not, which could mean that it is a particular object.


...

Be careful, these are all references to the Formidine Rift - NOT Raxxla.

Drew is not involved with the Raxxla thing, as far as I know, and I remember M.Brookes or D. Braben stating there will be no clues for Raxxla.
