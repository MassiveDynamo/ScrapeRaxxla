Be careful, these are all references to the Formidine Rift - NOT Raxxla.

Drew is not involved with the Raxxla thing, as far as I know, and I remember M.Brookes or D. Braben stating there will be no clues for Raxxla.

I am as curious about Raxxla as the rest of you. I have no concrete ideas on it.

Cheers,

Drew.
