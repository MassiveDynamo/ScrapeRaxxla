I had a hunch today that 'The jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies' might be a reference to the constellation Corona Borealis. I checked Alphekka (as it is in the Galaxy Map) which is the brightest star, sometimes called Gemma. This system turned out to be empty with only the star (and two degraded ss with ordinary wrecks and low-grade data/mats).
.
There might be another way to read the Alleged Toast of the Dark Wheel, if it is providing directions to Raxxla. What if each part is meant to be a clue to a particular system and, once you know all the systems, they can be used to determine/triangulate the location of the system with Raxxla, be it through a clear pattern in their arrangement or a (unique solution) system that is equidistant to all of them? If so, any idea what systems the other parts of the riddle might be referring to? (I think I still like the possibility that Alphekka is the system referenced by the first part and it being empty does not disprove its being involved).
