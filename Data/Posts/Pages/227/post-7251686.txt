Well this here is Cassiopeia, Mother of Princess Andromeda.
The big star in her brow is Zeta Cassiopeia.
Good Luck and o7

Nice image - good find.

Alt names: Fulu, Zeta Cassiopeiae, 17 Cassiopeiae, HD3360, HIP2920, HR153.

In Chinese astronomy, Zeta Cassiopeiae is called 附路, Pinyin: Fùlù, meaning Auxiliary Road, because this star is marking itself and standing alone in the Auxiliary Road asterism,Legs (mansion) (see : Chinese constellation).[10] 附路 (Fùlù) was westernized into Foo Loo, but that name was also designated for Eta Cassiopeiae by R.H. Allen, with the meaning of "a by-path".
