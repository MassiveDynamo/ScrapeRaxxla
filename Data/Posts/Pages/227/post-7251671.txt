Thanks for the tips - It was actually Jorki who took two hours to scan a system after getting it setup. I've given up as I don't really want to use mouse and keyboard after having shelled out for a HOTAS to specifically play this game, and it does not seem to have been designed with a HOTAS in mind, nor is it entirely clear to me after going through the tutorial at least five times how it works best and why I can't get certain things bound properly. Back to Stellaris.
