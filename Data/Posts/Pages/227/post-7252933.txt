You can get anything from entry point unless it's obscured by primary (or very close star).

All engineering on the DSS is converted to a single one that gives probes a greater surface area. It's the only available scanner mod now since scans are pretty much immediate.

The lighting is a little disconcerting, but it's mostly only close to stars that you get it. In neutron star systems, everything looks a washed out blue instead. I'm not certain if a like it or not, just find it strange.

Ah, yes I should have said I used to have a long range engineered scanner. Haven’t done any engineering with the new update yet. Though Tyko must start that grind soon, he’s almost at the target 200MCr, then the AspX and the grind.....
