It's not just you. I tried it during beta, couldn't figure it out after several attempts at setting keybinds/going through tutorial, gave up. Just upgraded, went through the tutorial again, set up keybinds again, and still can't figure it out or get it working properly with HOTAS. At least you managed to get to the point of actually exploring, I'm giving up until they retrofit the original honk. This isn't engaging gameplay even if you can get it working, it's just another grindy timesink. Sad, but not unexpected frankly. They've succeeded in killing the one thing that might have brought me back to the game. Oh well, maybe in six months the honk will be back.

Same thing here. Mostly playing ED here, on this thread. In six months I think the new patch with the "Extended FSS" will have been released.
So hyped.
Until then, Dual Universe, X4 and the Raxxla FD thread !
