but I did have a scanner engineered for long range so I could do most of my scanning from the starâ€™s location. The honk gives you some credits, the fss gives you more and the probe mapping gives you still more.

You can get anything from entry point unless it's obscured by primary (or very close star).

All engineering on the DSS is converted to a single one that gives probes a greater surface area. It's the only available scanner mod now since scans are pretty much immediate.

The lighting is a little disconcerting, but it's mostly only close to stars that you get it. In neutron star systems, everything looks a washed out blue instead. I'm not certain if a like it or not, just find it strange.
