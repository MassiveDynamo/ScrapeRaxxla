Here is another screenshot from the Alpha Cygni system map. This one is from VR.

As you can see, a third cloud becomes visible after a few minutes. This one is directly up from the star, bigger and less detailed than the other two(these merge in VR).

Is this something like the Lagrange clouds? within the system but a fair way out?
