From here we move to the next sonnet in the series, #19.
"On Cupid's bow how are my heartstrings bent,
That see my wrack, and yet embrace the same?"- When aligned properly the Class O-s of NGC 7822 align perfectly with Andromeda/Formadine Rift in one direction, and Bubble/Polaris in the opposite direction. We assume we are to be looking toward Andromeda and not the bubble at this point. NGC 281 Nebula is in line with the arrow from NGC 7822 to Andromeda, but we have searched every system in NGC 281 and found nothing.
But turning up nothing may be a good thing, it may be a confirmation of sorts that we need at this point as it affirms the next line.

Here's where you lost me. i know people badly want their efforts in the FRift to not have been in vain, but Raxxla is almost certainly inside the bubble. I was sure it was in the FRift for the longest time, but what we know for sure is that it was accessible in the original beta, and that rules out FRift categorically.
