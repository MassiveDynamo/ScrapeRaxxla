Here's where you lost me. i know people badly want their efforts in the FRift to not have been in vain, but Raxxla is almost certainly inside the bubble. I was sure it was in the FRift for the longest time, but what we know for sure is that it was accessible in the original beta, and that rules out FRift categorically.

While I totally agree that historically Raxxla being in the bubble makes the most sense, I for one am not concerned with where this riddle is leading me to, or What it's leading me to. I am just following what I see as being the sign posts along the way. We have not yet seen anyone, except for this Alpha Cygni development (which seems super interesting), produce any signs of being on the right track. For us, being in the NGC 7822 nebula specifically being there due to a previous clue (Brow Star, Zeta Cass), and then finding another clue once we got to the next location in our theory, a more solid one, in the form of the Cupids Arrow tourist beacon, was something of substance. It seemed to us to be a sign of being on track.
It was uncanny. We did what we saw as the first step, moved to the 2nd location, read some more of the codex and the sonnets and while I was reading the sonnets I stumbled upon a beacon which had the exact character mentioned in the next sonnet in its actual title and more. That was a strange experience.
