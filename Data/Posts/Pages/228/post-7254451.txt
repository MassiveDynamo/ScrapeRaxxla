Here's where you lost me. i know people badly want their efforts in the FRift to not have been in vain, but Raxxla is almost certainly inside the bubble. I was sure it was in the FRift for the longest time, but what we know for sure is that it was accessible in the original beta, and that rules out FRift categorically.
Erm... Have you got an actual FD source for the statement that it was accessible in Beta? There’s sources for it being in the Milky Way, but have never seen anything saying it’s actually accessible.
