IF the Stella poem contains necessary or even essential clues to find Raxxla, then I don't know how our non English-speakers friends (me included) will do (didn't find any complete translation ).
Or perhaps FD put different "localized" Raxxlas inside the game ? (I wont imagine the worst...)
From this point of view, the Toast may be more consistent. And the Stella poem just to confirm clues.

Yes, I also was thinking about this. I don't believe Frontier would hide some content behind poems or sonnets and making it only accessible to a subgroup of players which have a decent knowledge of the English language. I think if Fontier decides that it's time to find Raxxla, the clues will be much simpler and easier to follow...
