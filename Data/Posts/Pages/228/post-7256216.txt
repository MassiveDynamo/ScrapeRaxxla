Yes, I also was thinking about this. I don't believe Frontier would hide some content behind poems or sonnets and making it only accessible to a subgroup of players which have a decent knowledge of the English language. I think if Fontier decides that it's time to find Raxxla, the clues will be much simpler and easier to follow...

Much better expressed than I did and with a lot less words.
