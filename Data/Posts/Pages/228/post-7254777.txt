IF the Stella poem contains necessary or even essential clues to find Raxxla, then I don't know how our non English-speakers friends (me included) will do (didn't find any complete translation ).
Or perhaps FD put different "localized" Raxxlas inside the game ? (I wont imagine the worst...)
From this point of view, the Toast may be more consistent. And the Stella poem just to confirm clues.

I was sure it was in the FRift for the longest time,

To be honest, I spent months looking for the mYsTeRy in the Rift, convinced that I was looking for Raxxla. What a disappointment when it turned out to be a very human stranded ship...[haha]

Here's where you lost me. i know people badly want their efforts in the FRift to not have been in vain, but Raxxla is almost certainly inside the bubble.

Let's see.. Raxxla should very well be (have been ?) in the Bubble, specially due to that jump range thing and even DW is convinced of it.
Now, that was when J. Ryder was still alive. Since, the way to Raxxla was lost. That way. The short, easy, direct way. Lost or cut or ...obfuscated, just because JR found it.
To keep Raxxla secret, the "Raxxlians" had JR killed and the compromised path wipped out. At least, that's what I would have done if I was in charge. Plug the breach.
In eons, nobody found it again, not even TDW. Perhaps it simply is no longer there.
But, there can be another way to Raxxla. A new one. ED's way, MB's personal journey. And it may very well be more tortuous than the "lost way" and run through Cass, H&S, Cygni, etc... Or wherever, if the way goes through witch-space.
In witch-space , no place is a place and every door is also a key. This can also be linked to the sirens-thing, TDW's sirens and the Log sirens.
What I mean is, one thing is the proper Raxxla, and another thing is the way to Raxxla. Specially the starting point. They could be very distant in normal space as well as very close in witch-space. (Ask Jaques about it). And that is the point. Not so much where Raxxla is, but where the starting point/points is/are. (6 ? 6+2 ?)


Anyway, we all very well know that Raxxla is a mythical stellar body obfuscated in the outer rim which way to is told by the silent song of spheres.
Don't we ?
EDIT: ' Where is Raxxla? ' 'Oh, it's in the Milky Way '
('But where in the MW ? ' ' Well... I don't know. All around. Actually, there aren't real places in...' )
