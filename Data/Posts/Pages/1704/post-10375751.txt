“Bring up the Beaumont insurrection from 3294” Hammer form Elite Legacy.

The Beaumont insurrection was noted as being in 3294, and being far below Achenar, a populated system and a mining base in an asteroid belt ~500ls from a populated planet.
2nd reference to Beaumont in the book:

“The Beaumont system was a frontier world far below Achenar. No official reason or explanation was provided but Federal newsfeeds claimed that a bureaucratic oversight put a pirate clan captured during an Imperial Navy sweep of the area into the same mine where they’d been sent for hard labour. The mining base was positioned in a rich cluster in the asteroid belt around two AUs from the populated planet.”

Based on that description and assuming it was a local reference to a station: Beaumont Terminal | Kaukai. It's an Orbis starport.
