In regards to Ross 629, which in the book is mysterious enough, itâ€™s certainly not in game, but there are a number of similar named systems, numerically close in naming.

These seem to cover a certain area, albeit wide in certain sector. One might speculate the missing system ought to be in this general area, that is, if its intended, and not a discrepancy?
