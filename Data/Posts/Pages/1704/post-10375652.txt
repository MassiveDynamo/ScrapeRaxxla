But how would Ross 629 match the clues we have? Is the system IRL in the region of the Empyrean (or Hell)?

Well it might not, but I’m in the process of mapping the systems mentioned in the book, and it’s really to understand where these might be, because a few are separated by some distance and ‘might’ correlate to certain theories in a spacial relationship?

I’m going off the simplified assumption that Brookes literally tells us the ‘general’ area by the omitted system names, eg they aren’t in game, but he might be alluding to a specific area through his descriptions…

Maps to follow to back up this tin foil. It’s one of my oldest theories but I could not see the relevance until ‘potentially’ now.
