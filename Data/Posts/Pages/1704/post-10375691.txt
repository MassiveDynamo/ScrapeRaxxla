I like @Rochester's idea of a hollow "planet", which would fit the Paradise Lost theme perfectly. Given MB's penchant for PL, and the effort he expended putting that theme into ED, and that the Brookes Tour ends with the "pendent world" quotation, I'm leaning towards that possibility. It could perhaps be a reskinned Coriolis, which could fit the game mechanics and explain the logo. I'm assuming the entrance port would be fairly small and somehow hidden-maybe at the bottom of a ravine?
Apparently, Mercury is a contender on "hollow planet".

Mercury’s Strange Hollows - NASA Science
Enigmatic depressions on Mercury called "hollows" have puzzled scientists since the 1970s. Though none are as spooky as the Sleepy Hollow of Washington Irving’s legend, Mercury's hollows are just as mysterious, and seen nowhere else in the universe.
