Typo- Mars is a rouge planet! You mean "Rogue" planet! A rogue planet is not orbiting a star and should exist in its own instance...though might be found in a star system just not orbiting a barycentre. The orrery view should show it with a hyperbolic trajectory entering and leaving the system

MB confirmed possibility of Rogue Planets in-game when he said "Not all stars have planets, but then again not all planets have suns either"
All things Frontier Developments at E3 2014!
Think it might be "Paradiso Outpost", then an illegible (to me) line and "Independent Jurisdiction" on the line below. Your guess is as good as mine re the build no. It is indeed Paradiso Outpost - it's a deep space exploration support station. Michael
See my FDev quotes thread.

I don't know how we would find a system without a star...it would have low mass and IIRC system names are based on system mass as well as sector location.
