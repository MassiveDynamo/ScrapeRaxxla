Mmm I agree it’s a good candidate but spacially does it fit the physical description?

Image below: All systems with the word Beaumont in them are technically higher than Achdnar?



But… if you apply the in-game Greek compass…and shift the axis… but this is literally in the middle of nowhere?



Of course I’ve used this previously to map the path of Jacques, who travelled ‘south’ in alignment with Satans journey, some of these systems might be relatively close?
