Only if you're living in Paradise- I think that lies in UK somewhere between Lancashire, Lincolnshire & the North Sea, & a bit further South than Scotland..see my signature:

Paradise was on earth in PL. Then paradise was moved, not earth. Earth and the geo-centric universe universe around it should still be the pendent world.

It's the same story as all the other myths. The gate is up. We just don't know where up is.

Most likely candidates are the celestial or orbital north pole of earth or the galactic north pole. There are of course south poles and other planets poles as well.
An alternative up is also along the Milky Way, like this:



Omphalos, Axis mundi, pendant, tree of life are probably the same thing. We just don't know where that is.
