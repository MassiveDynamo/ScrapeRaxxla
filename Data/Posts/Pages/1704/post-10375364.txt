The system Ross 629 is mentioned in Brookes Legacy, it’s the only system bar one other that’s named in the book but not in game. I think this is intentional.

Any idea where this might be? Other than ‘where’s 628 and 280 relatively’?
SIMBAD's aliases are not helpful in the slightest:



However, EDGalaxyData (a great source of data dumps) has a table of renamed systems as part of their Body Mismatches analysis.
It illustrates some of the game's history nicely - Beagle Point, the Sirius exclave, Trappist-1, the Colonia bubble, the variable stars on the Orion Nebula getting named after scientists, the Witch Head exclave...

Although Ross 629 is not on the list, there are some instances of off-by-one corrections: V1577/V1576 Cygni, TX/TY Cancri, 39/40 Andromedae, 58/59 Ceti, 15/14 and 58/57 Geminorum, and my favorite: 2MASS J21541877+4712096 to 2MASS J21541877+4712097.
Not to mention the truncated names from EES2009 and the many DM99 duplicates.

Ross 628 is 150ly from Sol, so it might qualify.
