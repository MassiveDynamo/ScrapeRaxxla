Although the guy is claiming that he found it by comparing the Skybox with the trailer (even though the two apparently do not match) and is being very vague about how he so quickly narrowed it down to that planet. Lots of speculation on Reddit that other means were used given that one if the folks involved was apparently turfed from the Canonn due to a proclivity to look at files he's not supposed to...

All in all it definitely sounds like this is not the trailer INRA base people are looking for, but another one.
