Didn't speak to the original cmdr who found the site, but spoke to someone who seemed to know them. Apparently it was worked out from old lore.

Well 'worked out from old lore' might be a bit strong here. Searching close to Alioth because Hotice isn't to far away in FFE, still leaves a few systems.
CockieJarvis must have had some inside info here, as this base does not match the one in trailer and seem to be 125 years older than the Hotice base from FFE.
