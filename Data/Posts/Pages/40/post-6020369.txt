Seems like this thread is going off topic...

INRA bases are being discussed HERE I believe.

Agreed. I think we were hoping that perhaps these bases could somehow have clues to Raxxla. In the end, its just another red herring.
Im starting to get in the mindset that anything that could be a clue must have nothing to do with Raxxla
