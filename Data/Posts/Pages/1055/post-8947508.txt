Finding a location using the skybox is trial and error - select a star in the map, is it the right direction? If yes, jump there. Is what you were looking at on the skybox still in front of you? Jump again. If not, turn around and repeat!
Yeah, I think I'll do that. I just wanna have a first check on the asterisms, because maybe that helps.
In the video, it kinda looks to be near Aldebaran, maybe in Ophiuncus due to the shape around it.
But that is a very quick guess.
