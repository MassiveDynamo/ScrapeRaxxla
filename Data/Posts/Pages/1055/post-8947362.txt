Ok, this answers my question I had a few pages back. Seems that I'm coming to very similar conclusions/suspicions as you, independently.

Follow-up question: Did you get a mission in a Degraded Emission, where you had to scoop a black box and then got an assassination-mission (kill a religious leader)?

Personally I never bothered with the Mystery missions. Some other CMDRs did in IRH but as far as they can tell, it leads nowhere and the investigation was shut down. Afaik I remember the missions can be triggered easily enough, although I don't remember the exact circumstances.

Anyway to me, its more like a signboard that you are generally on the right track about what the whole Mystery is about i.e. we know you know and if you recognize us, come find us.
