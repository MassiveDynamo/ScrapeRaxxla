Great capture, this is the bg of "The Guardians". For those who over the video, take care to not confuse this with the bg for the ED intro, right after it.
This one feels like made by some designer. Either way, if there is a secret location, the asterism may be right.

But due to my belief, the game engine was used for the bg with the glow from the bottom.
I wonder if they could, somehow, underestimate a way to find it using the skybox.
