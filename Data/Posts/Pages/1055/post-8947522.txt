Green places have been pinching me due to the logo. Just started searching for them,
after having a check into polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (Coronene), searching for some nebulas, like Spirograph, and real-life novas.

One of these days, I saw a playlist of events... in the ED channel, and it starts with a talk about finding alien life.
The gentleman even speaks about the infrared but does not talk about the importance of PAHs, exactly on infrared.
And that got me thinking. Some videos after, there was this strange green glowing star behind "The Guardians".

This is the playlist
