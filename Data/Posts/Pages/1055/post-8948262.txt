Ya I was just hoping that the signal the beacon was referencing, was some already known event... And what better signal event could there be But who knows ... maybe its referencing a wandering planet that sends out random whispers telling us to "kill them all"... and this is just another point along its trajectory...

My 2 cents thoughts on finding it were that they either referred to something in one of the books or maybe were like all the other signals that we get or know about now and didnt know / still not sure what they are. Or its another dead herring that got shelved. Or an old GalNet story, something like that.

but it is like whoever wrothe this 'fluff' deliberately tried to hint at Raxxla / DW type conspiracy, recent GalNet for one example, linker JR ro a some secret org for years even though its the first we hear. They can string us along for years lets face it
