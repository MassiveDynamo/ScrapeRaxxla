They look like theyre all launching from those telescopes you put money in, I never realised they were black-ops Anti Aircraft Missile siights before!



My 2 cents thoughts on finding it were that they either referred to something in one of the books or maybe were like all the other signals that we get or know about now and didnt know / still not sure what they are. Or its another dead herring that got shelved. Or an old GalNet story, something like that.

but it is like whoever wrothe this 'fluff' deliberately tried to hint at Raxxla / DW type conspiracy, recent GalNet for one example, linker JR ro a some secret org for years even though its the first we hear. They can string us along for years lets face it

First rule of Lore Club:
There is Lore and there is Not Lore... there is no Fluff

Ya not sure about the signal - but I do like it - another string to tug on
