No clues I think, don’t see enough stars to draw any conclusions as to location!

But a nice observation nonetheless!

Edit: actually on closer inspection there are a few more stars than I saw at first glance. Anybody want to try enhancing it? I’m on iPad with limited photo editing at the moment. If I increase brightness and contrast there are a fair few stars and a lot of nebulosity/dust cloud visible to the left

This last screen seems to have been blurred a bit.
But the interesting part, to me at least, is that the other parts of the video - where the call to action is shown - seems to be rendered inside the game.
The green glowing in the bottom seems to be a star, due to the god rays, and that may be a POV of the location.

I'm willing to check, but I have no idea yet of how to find a location using just the skybox.
I heard some have done this before.
