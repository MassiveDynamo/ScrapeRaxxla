FFE starts in 3250. Which parts of the FFE history that has survived, is a bit hazy.
There are quite a few of the journal stories that have been confirmed by tourist beacons, in the Alioth region. The Antares story also starts in the journals.
Other parts have been completely abandoned. In FFE the federation had a huge population of sentient androids. The Empire used extensive cloning and genetic manipulation on their population.
The Thargoid part seem to be relatively intact, up to the point where the hand coded missions starts and the player makes choices that influences the overall events. The Journal extracts contains the stories for all the paths. It seems that in ED, not much happened after Mic Turner went missing. All we know is that Bill Turner has a Quest ship with Thargoid damage, in his workshop.

Ya I was just hoping that the signal the beacon was referencing, was some already known event... And what better signal event could there be But who knows ... maybe its referencing a wandering planet that sends out random whispers telling us to "kill them all"... and this is just another point along its trajectory...
