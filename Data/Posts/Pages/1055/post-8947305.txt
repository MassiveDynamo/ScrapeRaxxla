Green dot in background, might be Raxxla?
No clues I think, don’t see enough stars to draw any conclusions as to location!

But a nice observation nonetheless!

Edit: actually on closer inspection there are a few more stars than I saw at first glance. Anybody want to try enhancing it? I’m on iPad with limited photo editing at the moment. If I increase brightness and contrast there are a fair few stars and a lot of nebulosity/dust cloud visible to the left
