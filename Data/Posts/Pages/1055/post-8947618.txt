Anyone ever find LL Pegasi in game? Otherwise known as the Spiraling stars?
Most of the real life stars put in to Galmap is usually from either hipparchus (HIP), Henry Draper (HD), Yale Catalogue of Bright Stars (HR) or Bonner Durchmusterung (BD) star catalouges. Some famous stars are named as their arabic names, or if a member of a constellation, named with latin star num name. Ex: In ED given name, Ras Elased Australis is also known as Epsilon Leonis, 17 Leonis, HD 84441, HIP 47908 and HR 3873. If you type one of them to galmap, it will take you to the star most of the time. If you are not sure a star is in game or you want to see its othe catalouge names, there is a very useful website that has a lot of information on most stars and what i experienced, if a star is in that website, its also in Elite dangerous.

There is a magnifier right top and u can search stars from there.

Ps: Right now cant go online so i cant verify if LL pegasi is in game or not.
