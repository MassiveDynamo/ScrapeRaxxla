Green dot in background, might be Raxxla?
No clues I think, donâ€™t see enough stars to draw any conclusions as to location!

But a nice observation nonetheless!

Edit: actually on closer inspection there are a few more stars than I saw at first glance. Anybody want to try enhancing it?

Yeah just noticed the green star however may be just a light point for the letter I to glow, the stars in the background move while that doesnt so doubt you could line it up with anywhere. Below i have atatched a snip of the stars and circled the one closest to the glow
