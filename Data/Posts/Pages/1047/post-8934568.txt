You know when Indy said in "Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade" that never in history has a treasure been marked by an X? And then in Venice there's this huge X on the floor?

It wouldn't surprise me if FDev did mark Raxxla by an X and I kinda expect that now
Ok,ok, If you want stories about placing X'es, I have them
Comms Record:
I hope you don't expect me to draw an X on a map for you! The only person getting the transponder code is me.
Comms Record:
I swear if you draw an X on the ground I'll shoot you myself. Lets just stash the loot and head to the safe house.
PS. Sorry - that's just to maintain newly born tradition=)
