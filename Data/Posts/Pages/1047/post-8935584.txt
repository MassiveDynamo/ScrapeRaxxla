I must admit I have been on a little break too, booked a holiday cruise on a lovely megaship from Colonia to Beagle Point recently. I just love tax free shopping for chocolates in uncharted areas of galaxy. Also it's amazing how you can find an Irish bar no matter where you are. Who knows what is going to happen out there, might find Raxxla, or a sea food buffet, maybe both.
