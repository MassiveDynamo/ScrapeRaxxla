Can only confirm it, with a citation:

Comms Record:
I don't know what you expect to find out here. This wreck's been here forever and I've never heard of any secret treasure being hidden inside.
Someone's messing with you.

You need to read between the lines! If the tip-off never mentioned a secret treasure, then it means there is something

As I said, I consider them fluff, but I'll keep them in mind anyway because they might lead you somewhere as a side effect.
