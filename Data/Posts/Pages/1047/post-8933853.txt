The T-9 Trades missions get given if you stay in a system for long enough ~15mins? Maybe you are hopping around more..

That's what I have read here in the forums. My first impression was exactly this, that the trade beacon occurs after some time.

I was mining in the Ega-system (just to unlock the engineer) and after some time I hear "Mission critical message received" (paraphrased) while I didn't have any active mission. I didn't notice the trade beacon in the star system panel and I left the Ega-system to do my Powerplay-merits.
When I jumped back into the Ega-system, I got the "Mission critical message received" immediately after jumping into Ega. Before I jumped into Ega I visited the Wille-system and accepted a mission from Wreaken Construction to Ega, so at first I assumed it was a bonus for fast delivery.
I then noticed the Trading Beacon; so there's the possibility that the Trading Beacon is persistent after it appears.

The second time I got the Trading Beacon was again in the Ega-system, and in the same game session I also got my first "mysterious tip-off".
I do indeed more hopping around, but when I stay in one system, I stay a long time. I've also read that the tip-off is dependent on the number of missions you have done for a minor faction.

Anyway, after reading here in the forums I assumed that the Trading Beacon and the mysterious tip-offs are just procedural fluff and they have no story/lore-related effect.
After reading Jorki's collection of DB-/MB-quotes, I'm going to take into account that they might have some effect but we don't know what further breadcrumbs we need to follow.
