The problem is that looking at tip off texts - either "directly" or between lines - is the less reliable approach =) My confirmation above is based on pure mathematics and programming points of view, in general I do not bother to analyse texts.
But, yeah, I can also read between lines. And there I see that tip off logs were really well thought and ideally placed teasers, and our present discussion - 5 years since their first introduction - is the best prove of that. Also, you know, really good teasers do not usually contain any real spoilers, quite the contrary - and the results one can observe on a regular basis up to nowadays=). Brilliant design decision.

You know when Indy said in "Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade" that never in history has a treasure been marked by an X? And then in Venice there's this huge X on the floor?

It wouldn't surprise me if FDev did mark Raxxla by an X and I kinda expect that now
