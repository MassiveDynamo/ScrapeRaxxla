You know when Indy said in "Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade" that never in history has a treasure been marked by an X? And then in Venice there's this huge X on the floor?

It wouldn't surprise me if FDev did mark Raxxla by an X and I kinda expect that now

It would be Rala then, doesnâ€™t sound as good!
