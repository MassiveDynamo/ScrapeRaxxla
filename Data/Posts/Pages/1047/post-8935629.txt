The unnamed contacts picture was yellowish/orange, pixelated/glitched and had had dark box with something along the lines of "redacted", "error", or "unknown" written in it. My immediate instinct, since im neck deep in tinfoil right now was to attribute it to TDW since it somewhat matched colours with the Codex entry's picture.

Obfuscated!

Seriously its probably flavour text and fluff. Reality is its more like a follow-on mission where its activated by your recent actions, doing missions for a faction for example. Some are just more 'mysterious' than others, if criminal or illegal goods or weapons they will hide their faces.

On the other hand its either deliberately or accidentally designed in a way to feed into our conspiracy theories, i tend to think not, they had no idea how much we would read into anything and just did it as a more mysterious / thrilling scenario than the usual BBS ones.

Turned the mission in and was congratulated by the Green Party for my contribution. Nothing else happened

Yes, welcome to the no pay-off missions. Where you stumble on something or someone gets in touch and you do this stuff all excited as to what the story is and.....nothing. Wait til you stumble over the Secret Agent one. Thats hours of fun and then, 'oh was that the end?'

Tip-off missions mentioned above are slightly different as at least you usually get an 'ending' however 'disappointing' that is, theres no treasure here what were you expecting? which is a clever if brutal writing ending, not everything pays off, this isnt that sort of game....and depending on how new you are maybe some 1st experiences too.

And to link it to another way of thinking, minimal info allows our minds and imagination to fill in the gaps and go 'exploring' for that answer which is far more fun than being in a linear storyline.
