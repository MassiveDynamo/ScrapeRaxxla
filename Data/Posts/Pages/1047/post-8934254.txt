You need to read between the lines! If the tip-off never mentioned a secret treasure, then it means there is something

As I said, I consider them fluff, but I'll keep them in mind anyway because they might lead you somewhere as a side effect.
The problem is that looking at tip off texts - either "directly" or between lines - is the less reliable approach =) My confirmation above is based on pure mathematics and programming points of view, in general I do not bother to analyse texts.
But, yeah, I can also read between lines. And there I see that tip off logs were really well thought and ideally placed teasers, and our present discussion - 5 years since their first introduction - is the best prove of that. Also, you know, really good teasers do not usually contain any real spoilers, quite the contrary - and the results one can observe on a regular basis up to nowadays=). Brilliant design decision.
