Gamma was when we got access to the full galaxy. Before gamma, there were only a small region that was open.
Gamma was when I started playing, so nothing existed before then. Muh immersion! ;-)

Plus I think it was November 3300 which explains that weird gap in the Galnet mentioned earlier, I don't think they did any during Gamma?
