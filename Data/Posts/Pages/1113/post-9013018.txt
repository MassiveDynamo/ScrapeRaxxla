So, I've completed my swing back through the rest of the Great Rift, route was basically:


Aquila Dark Region Nebula
B133 Nebula
B92 Nebula
Corona Australis Dark Region
Snake Nebula
Had done the other end ( Lupus, Lupus B, Coalsack Nebula, Coalsack Dark Region, Musca Dark Region) when I headed out, so have completed the circle via Seagull, Thors Helmet and the Orion Complex, sort of the long way around but I really wanted to find Didn't see anything unusual and no Thargoid presence whatsoever in the bullet list above, but did come across something interesting at least.




On my way back to Felicity shortly to see if she'll loan me the keys to the door that isn't a door to the place that isn't a place when I sell my data.

Edit: I resisted the urge to find and map every Rift system identified in Simbad

Well done! I suspect there is no need to honk every system in Simbad for the Great Rift, or at least there shouldn’t be a need! IFF this is the route to TDW membership then it ought to be a threshold value of scan data from those regions. Don’t forget HIP 84605 though!

Yes, we had a thread going a while back (2 years??) about Sarasvati, Galcop and a possible sister ship or two. The hypothesis was, if I remember correctly, that Thunderchild was an AI developed for anti-Thargoid ops/watch; whether that was the ship itself or something else is TBD. The logs imply there should be a library of useful info somewhere. Though war-bred AI is rather reminiscent of the Guardians!!
