And dont bother the dark wheel entry or the rest of raxxla, just tell us

"To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies! To the whisperer in witch-space, the siren of the deepest void! The parent's grief, the lover's woe, and the yearning of our vagabond hearts. To Raxxla!"

Except for the pearl, which is translated as a gemstone, everything else is accurate enough.
And there is a comma between the whisper and the siren, I just saw a phrase here that supposedly sirens yell from the void.
