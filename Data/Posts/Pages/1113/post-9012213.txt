Dude, we (at least i) cant speak Russian. Can you please compare it to the English version? Are there any meaning differences, synonims, misuses? I dont think something could come out of different translations, but at least, safer than sorry.
I don't know English very well. mostly just technical, so I only compare this to the same translations.
I posted THIS here because I was asked to do so.
