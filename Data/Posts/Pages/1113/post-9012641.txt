So, I've completed my swing back through the rest of the Great Rift, route was basically:


Aquila Dark Region Nebula
B133 Nebula
B92 Nebula
Corona Australis Dark Region
Snake Nebula
Pipe Nebula, as "Bowl" and "Stem"
Scorpius Dark Region
Ophiuchus Dark Region
Ophiuchus Dark Region B
Ophiuchus Dark Region C
Rho Ophiuchi Nebula
Had done the other end ( Lupus, Lupus B, Coalsack Nebula, Coalsack Dark Region, Musca Dark Region) when I headed out, so have completed the circle via Seagull, Thors Helmet and the Orion Complex, sort of the long way around but I really wanted to find that emu. Didn't see anything unusual and no Thargoid presence whatsoever in the bullet list above, but did come across something interesting at least.

SPOILER: MYSTERIOUS(?) DISCOVERY



On my way back to Felicity shortly to see if she'll loan me the keys to the door that isn't a door to the place that isn't a place when I sell my data.

Edit: I resisted the urge to find and map every Rift system identified in Simbad
