Perhaps California nebula is the first war region where Miacke was,
Lots of theories about Miacke/Miackce here as well: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/question-miacke-thargoid-homesystem.383216/

Even if it was located in California Nebula, still odd that they would tolerate human expansion there, as it still has active barnacle sites, UAs were (supposedly) first present there, etc. But definitely hard to know what has been retconned and what hasn't.

And if the Turner Alliance faction were working with the Thargoids there, would make sense that The Club might intervene and enroll a bunch of pirates to try to shut that down.
