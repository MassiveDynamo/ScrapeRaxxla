thought I'd take a break from Questing & look into the Hesperus mystery. Anybody still looking?
I may end up doing that when I get back. BTW, HIP 84605 is 38 Ophiuchus in Simbad, so is likely near the centre of the real Ophiuchus Dark Region and therefore near the centre of the Great Rift (although that is not indicated in Simbad in any way that I can see): http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=hip+84605&submit=submit+id
