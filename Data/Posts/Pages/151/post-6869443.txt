I jumped back on Elite at home over the weekend (PS4) because that account is still in the bubble (PC is marooned at Sag A*). I didn't achieve much other than buy a new ship and visit Lave, Tionisla and Teorge. I did however keep an eye out in Witchspace for the star cluster you were talking about and I do get where you're coming from now. There is certainly a passing resemblance to the one in your screenshot, so I agree that yours (Chi Persei) is much closer in appearance than what I had in mind (NGC 7822).

Quite where that leads us now is another question...


As I said above, I was in Tionisla over the weekend after someone else (nooblite?) posted recently about ship graveyards. Annoyingly I couldn't find any such graveyard, but I can't say I'm surprised as DW said as much in one of his last related Elite Tweets.

Don't know where I'm gonna go from there... Lave proved to be a bust as well for anything strange or significant. I'll keep reading these here forums until another idea comes along...

Yes, it seems like the long-promised Tionisla ship graveyard has fallen by the wayside. Possibly an FD reaction to the salt thrown around after the Salomé event since it was related to that storyline.
however I was thinking more poetically of anything related to death/graveyard etc that might in some way match the “ghost world” phrase from TDW. As far as I’m aware Tionisla graveyard is the only one in the lore; but how about Pluto ( ruler of the underworld), or its moon Charon (greek myth ferryman to Hades). Is there a Hades in-game?

just throwing some thoughts out...
