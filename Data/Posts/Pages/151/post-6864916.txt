MICHAEL BROOKES: There are hybrids in the game. You can’t take any species together and make them hybrid. We’ve basically said that there is a certain hybrids and there ones that are already there in the lore – we’re not adding anything in that sense. But what we are adding is, you can do genetic modifications for their attributes but also for how their skin looks, so there are different color dinosaurs. Try to make them a bit more individual.

I'm surprised that different colored dinosaurs aren't for sale on the Frontier Store for 10 Euros each ...
