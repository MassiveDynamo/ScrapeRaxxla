Maybe off topic, but the 12 thargoid ground things in witch head have tahrgoid symbols on them that look like letters. 5 = C
Eh? There's more than 12 Thargoid barnacle sites on some of the planets in the WHN, although some are already destroyed / harvested when you get there while others have 1-5 MA that regrows on relog.

Didn't pay much attention to the logos on them. On my way there now with repair mats...

[Edit: Looking at a pair of barnacles WHS LC-V c2-10 planet A4, site [6] - looks the same as here]
