Not necessarily -it assumes they have an idea of what raxxla is and some general precepts about it though- or the initiation would be very boring. Thanks

Hmmm.
So the 'riddle' could be unrelated to Raxxla itself, simply a mechanism for identifying potential candidates for membership. Interesting.

If that were true, then TDW would need to have 'seeded' the toast into the rumormill, rather than it being an actual toast they use. Definitely a possibility - though equally we could be back to @PeteACarter's laughing pirates

Edit
Or it's a 'clue' and FDev don't care about logical consistency
