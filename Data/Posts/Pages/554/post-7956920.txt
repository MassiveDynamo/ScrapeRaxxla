I still think that Mother of the Galaxies is Virgo because:
Virgo constellation contains alot of galaxies, huge galaxy cluster is there
it is also Demeter in greek mythology and galaktikos is a milk
it is also Astraea in roman mythology (star-maiden, Astrophile)
spiralling stars are also galaxies
names of the both raxxla-related womens in codex (Cora and Cynthia) are the names of Demeter's daughters, and btw Sideris means 'constellation'...
