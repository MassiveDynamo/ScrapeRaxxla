True- looking at toasts in general they are seldom used to convey a direct path or narrative but rather seem to hit the salient people/points or major tenements of the toasts' subject.

Assuming 'The toast of the Dark Wheel' is a fraternal toast and specifically related to initiation, I would expect a focus on the important aspects of the subject .. in our case raxxla. I think we have been treating it as a riddle from the start – but not overtly describing it as one.

This is still predicated on the assumption that TDW know where Raxxla is.

That said, credit for approaching it from a different direction.
