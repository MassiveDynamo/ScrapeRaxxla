Now i should add that there is something very strange in the Virgo constellation in ED. As you know, in ED sky as visible from Sol is very simular to the real sky... except one star that is bright and very well visible in ED but does not exist in reality at all... Shoujeman, that is near Auva. It is bright star in ED, but there are no stars in that location at all in real life.
