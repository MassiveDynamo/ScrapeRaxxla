Yeah... but the thing is that the English toast doesn't use this term.
My point is, no toast in any language strictly tells where to search. As I ironically-much showed when comparing localisations. It's just poetry, each one in its own linguistic sensibility.

True- looking at toasts in general they are seldom used to convey a direct path or narrative but rather seem to hit the salient people/points or major tenents of the toasts' subject.

Assuming 'The toast of the Dark Wheel' is a fraternal toast and specifically related to initiation, I would expect a focus on the important aspects of the subject .. in our case raxxla. I think we have been treating it as a riddle from the start – but not overtly describing it as one.

SPOILER: INITIATION RITE AS A RIDDLE



The initiation/liminial stage is the threshold, It is the gateway to becoming a member – I imagine that as Raxxla itself is seen as a Gateway the symbolism would be dripping. So hopefully we can make something of it
