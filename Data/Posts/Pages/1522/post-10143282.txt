Question: is it possible to identify from EDSM when the Oracle or Donars Oak stations were first identified?
Not sure... would be nice though.

There was another commander who says something similar also on Aug 3 2017 that Donars Oak was new then. And further into the conversation mentions that The Oracle was constructed earlier- related to the Pleiades Research Station CG but questioning who was behind it really. - The CG was done by Abroin Universal PLC an Independent faction but they Quote Mahon in the Community Goal Description. And according to Commander Semio - with the construction of Donars Oak - Cooper Research Associates were the first superpower (Alliance) affiliated group to take over the system.

SPOILER: DESCRIPTION FROM CG:
