Possible, thatâ€™s a good logical solution.

However in a live stream FD do hint the Thargoids were looking for something?

What that something is an unknown, or maybe FD were taken out of context, they might have just been referring to the caustic elements for collection to enable the narrative to progress?

I hope the Thargoids are not linked to Raxxla, but considering their locality close to the bubble it deserves some consideration, there are some peculiar links, likely arbitrary, but we need to at least assess them so as to rule them out.

The Thargoids are the main storyline in ED. They are a constant force in the Galaxy, that we have to learn to live with. There is always the possibility that Raxxla is directly linked to the Thargoids.

The Guardians are a mirror of our self. So far we only know the story of the Gauardians that failed their interaction with the Thargoids and their own technology. We mostly try to copy these guys, for some reason.
There are some small indications of a successful branch of Guardians, that may still be around. I think they are the most probable Raxxla 'builders'. The question is do we have to find Raxxla to learn about them or must we learn about them, to find Raxxla?
