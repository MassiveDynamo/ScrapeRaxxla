See manual I attached. Unless that is fan-made manual. If you have the real one, I would appreciate it. I didn't play that era of Elite so I cannot swear I don't actually have a fan-edited version.
Jupp. That manual is fan-made for JJFFE. A reverse engineered, share ware version that made it possible to play FFE on computers with a graphics card.
JJFFE is brilliant and I have played it more than the original FFE. It can still be dowloaded and played.

As it says on page V, in the manual:
A substantial amount of additional material came from the web site of Gra-
ham ‘Jades’ Thurlwell, at http://www.jades.org/ffe.htm. This material in-
cludes the systems list, the technology levels map, statistics and reviews and

graphics for the ship list, parts of the equipment list, systems of interest, Who’s
Who, trade routes, career guide, and more.

The best page for FFE tips. Jades did include a few bits about him self in the data, though.
