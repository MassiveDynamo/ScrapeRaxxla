There is another angle that I believe ultimately links to The Pilot's Federation itself. It was buried in the "Who's Who" section of the FFE manual on page 113. The specific angle is Janus Incorporated is native to the system now known as Delphi and previously known as Pleiades Sector IR-W D1-55. In FFE, there is an organization known only as J-Corp which is an INRA front company. J-Corp appears to part of how bounties, codex discoveries, etc. are paid out. I believe J-Corp is likely Janus Incorporated. The description in FFE would link it to Facece as Startport York would be Fortress York in Facece. This implies one of the names for Facece is Miphize. Now, I don't think the story arc was wholly abandoned but with major CMDR groups not investigating the old lore like Salom√© said they choose to tell it in ways the CMDRs would follow.

Notable, that the modern ship named the Python is actually the Boa.

I don't think so, the Boa is a lot taller and more cylindrical in cross-section than the Pythons in the original game.
