Yes if I recall it wasn’t announced but I suspect just identified by players because that area was generally rather busy.

Question is however, was it an obvious clue to draw attention to Delphi; is it totally unrelated; or does it point elsewhere?

Accepting potential identifiers exist in the bubble (see my ramblings on an underworld / Yggdrasil) their existence naturally pre-dates the introduction of said codex…?

Chicken / egg

Assumption 1: Delphi is an obvious link to the codex via the Omphalos. Donars Oak has nothing to do with Yggdrasil, instead it’s all tied to Zeus (thunder gods). Tau Ceti etc is likewise unrelated.

Assumption 2: Delphi and Donars Oak were inserted by FD to draw our attention to the bubble.

Assumption 2 only works if we accept those systems in the bubble (Yggdrasil etc) have relevance, because they existed before FD inserted Delphi!

If they don’t have relevance it’s assumption 1 and everything revolves around Delphi.

Or Delphi is totally unrelated.

Well to play on chicken and egg - the Oracle and Donars Oak were in Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55 first (before the name change). Im not sure who constructed it - but I suspect it was Abroin Universal PLC.

The Abroin Universal PLC construct a Pleiades Research Center (after an earlier CG to create completed on JULY 28 3303.) - but dont say exactly where it is. It is mentioned again AUG 5 3303 Also Aegis is created at same time - but supposedly not connected.

Donars Oak and the Oracle were seen by commander on AUG 3 3303 edit - on re reading what he wrote - sounds like oracle was there but donars oak was new?

Aegis announces a new initiative creating new laboratories at various starports - including the Oracle DEC 2 3303
