Also note the 8 Maelstroms appear to be centering towards Alpha Hydri a known permit lock since the first games that used to cause your game to crash if you jumped there and is 71ly from sol direct on the route to Archenar, this would put it in line with the 2296 date lore of first rumored if the thargoids use this as some form of (Center of area) staging area for them (May have been a Guardian war era staging post between the pleiades and coalsack i mean if they travel to both areas they would pass through both us and Alpha Hydri)
Great confirmation, I came to the same conclusion, do the Maelstroms point to this area of space and if so why?
