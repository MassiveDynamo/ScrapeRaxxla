Possible, thatâ€™s a good logical solution.

However in a live stream FD did hint the Thargoids were looking for something?

What that something is, is an unknown, or maybe FD were taken out of context, they might have just been referring to the caustic elements for collection to enable the narrative to progress?

I hope the Thargoids are not linked to Raxxla, but considering their locality close to the bubble it deserves some consideration, there are some peculiar links, likely arbitrary, but we need to at least assess them so as to rule them out.
