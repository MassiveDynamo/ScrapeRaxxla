Drew does tell us that dark systems are L/Y/T systems now, in Premonition.

We know those pre launch ‘miss-jump’ systems were planned to hide the mysteries of the game.

The question is how much did FD hold onto of this older mechanic, if so Raxxla could be in one of those class of systems than others?

Of note these systems do form a regional plain in game. I believe the Maelstroms may be focused upon it somehow!
