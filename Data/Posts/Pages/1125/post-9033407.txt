A polite request - please keep Odyssey off this thread, Im avoiding anything to do with it until I can play on XB and dont want any info or spoilers, Im having to skip pages of other threads already and dont want to do the same here on my favourite thread, thank you all, I know there will be honest 'mistakes' I can live with that I wont hold it against you.

An impolite request - Shut up about Odyssey or Ill report you all as Off Topic!111!
Hahahah - ya good luck with avoiding it

Will try to restrain myself from revealing all the hidden Odyssey/Raxxla connections found while tromping around though
