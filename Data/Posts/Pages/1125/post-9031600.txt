Thats one of the reasons I dont think CMs are told the secret of Raxxla at all and why I put no faith in the asteroid field comment from a previous CM 'Youre looking in the right place'. To me he was clearly having a joke. Others see something different. Coca Cola dont tell every employee the secret recipe and neither do KFC (although that one did get reverse engineered by a member of the public).

I've asked on another thread whether the CMs have access to the original Lore Bible that Authors got, that shouldn't be too controversial to answer but will help us understand where the line is of what they know and what they dont. (eg Care Homes sometimes have a folder with the history of the person in care and employees are encouraged to read it to understand and know about the person and their likes and dislikes, but they wont know the bank details of the person that is kept for a few people only, there is a line drawn of what info to share)
I thought KFC recipe was based on the gathering around the cauldron in Macbeth?
