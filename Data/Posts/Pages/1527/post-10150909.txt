A guardian ark ship in Sol could actually make a lot of sense. Maybe at first it was just a cool unique object to find, but if it were a megaship kind of thing FD could have easily upgraded it to allow docking or other things as well.

Lore wise it would explain the technological advantages and "treasures", and (correct me if im wrong) i seem to remember that the Guardians had technologies like neural implants that allowed them to come together and collaborate in kind of shared virtual worlds, which would even explain "a gateway to other universes".

Why do we call them Guardians anyway? Could it be possible that there is an ancient Guardian ark ship in Sol that was designed as a kind of early warning system to detect Thargoids advancing closer to Guardian space?

A lot to ponder in any case!

Ram Tah called them Guardians, we donâ€™t know what they called themselves....
Maybe the Goa'uld?
