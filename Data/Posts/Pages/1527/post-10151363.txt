Didnt Ram Tah call them Guardians because of the way they guarded their young?

Yes, Ive been postulating for a while that a Guardian AI is at the heart of the Pilot’s Federation...the use of a triangular motif in UC interface and ship’s nav panel (now just a brief transition, you need to record video and slow replay to see it) very similar to the triangles on Guardian obelisks suggests this. Creation of humanity as either a food source, or as a successor to the Guardian race, or as a weapon against the Thargoids are possibilities IMO.
I suspect that AI is based on Triton, and the (ark?) ship which brought it to Sol is Raxxla; this is another reason for my latest hypothesis that Raxxla is hidden in Neptune’s Lassel ring (well, long thought it was in Sol, latest hypothesis is just a location refinement based on Han_Zen’s clarification of the outermost parts of the logo as tridents, and reassessment if “Princess Astrophel” book title as an anagram).
I think the rest of the Guardian AI is held in the permit locked area of space out towards Beagle Point, Col70 is Thargoid, & I suspect that Bovomit contains the escaped human AI.

Unfortunately I dont think any of this helps us to find Raxxla...which is probably hidden by the darned RNG mechanism with no clue where to drop out of SC....sometimes I hate the design implementation of this game§§

Edit
There’s another possibility-that the Guardian AI is Raxxla, and we’ll get the Triton permit when (if) we find the ship....

Edit2
$$ Though most of the time I love it...never before played any other computer game for 7+ years!
Just hate FD’s RNG fixation...
