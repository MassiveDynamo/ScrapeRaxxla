Ahhh the asterix

Just a thought but what if we look at the eighth moon of an unnamed gas giant differently.

8th moon could refer to a time - autumn (eighth lunar month) or even the fall equinox?

“Unnamed gas giant” could mean to rearrange the letters in gas giant….

IMHO more likely either an indavertent or deliberate deception by LYTa Crane & perhaps a moon of an 8th planet, a GG? e.g. Neptune.....

However thats for the TDW stealth station & I suspect may be a total red herring. For Raxxla, Ive been pondering anagrams of Princess Astrophel again today.
“At three A ring in Shinrarta” is feasible, and would comply with “you need to be Elite”
However I think Han_ Zen is right about the trident, and on further thought I think the preferred anagram solution is
“At the Lassel ring in Sol”... for Neptune
Ive done some googling, and while the normal spelling is per the astronomer’s name with double ‘ll’ i.e. “Lassell”,
I also found at least two spellings in learned papers with only a single final ‘l’!

Lassel/Lassell ring is IRL between 0.177 - 0.190 ls radius from Neptune.

Spent a couple of hours there this afternoon, but nothing found so far.
