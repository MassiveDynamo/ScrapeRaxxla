One trident like ᛉ and one like ᛣ and put then on top of each other -> ᛡ
Ahhh the asterix

Just a thought but what if we look at the eighth moon of an unnamed gas giant differently.

8th moon could refer to a time - autumn (eighth lunar month) or even the fall equinox?

“Unnamed gas giant” could mean to rearrange the letters in gas giant….
