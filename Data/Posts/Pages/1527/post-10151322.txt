Seriously though was there any specific reason why the name "Guardians" was chosen? What are they guarding, defending or protecting?

We know the Guardians went extinct 1-2 million years ago, driven to extinction by the Constructs. Perhaps coincidentally, this is around the time the first members of the Homo genus appeared on earth.

We also know that the Constructs were divided about wiping out the Guardians, with the military constructs being opposed to the decision.

There is a curious line in the logs about the Constructs as well;
"It makes Ram Tah wonder what happened to these Constructs, and what they eventually became. Were they destroyed? Or do they still exist, somewhere in the vastness of space?"

They were very adept at genetic engineering, and were known to create new species. They could even be responsible for creating humans, maybe even just as a food source.

Even if they didnt, they are noted as feeling "a spiritual connection to the environment, and a collective responsibility to maintain it", so they could have seen Earth as a kind of nature reserve. Wanting to protect it against destruction.

Knowing that the Thargoids seeded their territory with barnacles, and that the territory eventually became Guardian space, and knowing where the barnacles have been found in correlation to the ancient guardian sites; Sol could have easily been part of Guardian space at some point.

All this makes me wonder if there is an ancient Guardian military Construct (some type of massive war machine), somewhere in Sol?

If so, is that Raxxla? And how could any of that information help locate it?

I will have to spend more time researching and thinking about all this
