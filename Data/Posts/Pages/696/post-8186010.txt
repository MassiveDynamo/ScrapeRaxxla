Hello everyone hope everyone is having a blast in the search for Raxxla. I figure I share something that strike me as interesting but never thought about it up until today when I realized something I read about a couple of days ago. Maybe it's way out there but obviously this discussions always lead to covering the galaxy with tinfoil. I like to go back to the Raxxla codex a certain paragraph that struck me as odd but maybe overlooked.

Several versions of the Raxxla story mention an alien artefact, the Omphalos Rift, described
as a gateway or tunnel through which parallel universe can be accessed. These details
however, were later shown to bear a striking resemblance to the children's story Princess
Astrophel and Spiralling Stars, and soon lost credibility. Undaunted, some Raxxla
seekers insisted that the storyâ€™s author had cunningly concealed facts about the
mysterious locale in his book as hints for those with eyes to see.

As we all know we dug deep into the books " Astrophil and Stella " which to me is my opinion is far from being a childern's book actually it is quite the opposite of that. It was actually a love tell of a man enamored with a women.

To me seems like this paragraph is pushing for the idea that the Mandela Effect is being put into play.

Edit: To add so what does this mean? Well one possible outcome to this idea is maybe Raxxla isn't called Raxxla at all. We know of it as such because that what we were told it is. But if a Parallel universe pulls something into our universe the name would of changed to something else.
