Just had a thought. Just how cool it is that none of any of this we talk about here seems to matter. Not much seems more important than anything else. It's just a ton of information and leads and connections and ideas and thoughts. Endless hypothesizing with no apparent result from any angle. Not outwardly anyways. What the hell are we dealing with!? Who the hell created this thing?! lol.
CMDR Marcos Black (or something along those lines) created the thread, and as I have said on numerous occasions, people spend more time on the thread than they do searching for Raxxla. This thread was meant to be a progress log, but now it's a tinfoil-fest.

Edit: nobody has any idea what we are dealing with. Raxxla is currently nothing more than a name and a rumor.
