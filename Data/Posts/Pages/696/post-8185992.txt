Of course, Fernweh is the German for Wanderlust, so if we take the DW toast, and put it through the same process, but use the German variant of the cyper and then pop it into Google Translate, you get:

"It is the nlbic acid glycol sulphate onsd juice kvylve kj nfprkeiz! I'm not a fan of this movie, so wzear vk xyr ziluijg rspi! Xyr leyjrk'f cvpjj, liquid pvaii'f ssl, fru gje fjeiaern tj fhn zhlesbjh ojeigo. Xv Weokhe!"

Interesting that some of it translates. Probably coincidence.....or maybe we are on the right lines, but just not quite there?
He quoted himself on the ferweh cipher. Iâ€™ll get the other one too.
