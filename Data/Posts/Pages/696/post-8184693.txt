Blake's Los and Ophite cosmology
Cista Mystica as a portable Pythia of Delphi.
Budha (Mercury, Hermes, Wodan?), The son of lunar Chandra rides a winged lion, (Like Apollo rides a Griffin, Like Alexander in image of Helios Kosmokrator), measuring out the universe in three steps, path of Vishnu.

Witch's Reach, Cauldron.
Mary,

The prophetess.
