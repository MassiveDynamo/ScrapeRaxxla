So it wasnâ€™t hexedit in this case
Im pretty sure that someone ran 'raxxla' through with hexedit as the key and came up with Kwatis or something on those lines, since in hindsight im not sure how the 2 xs wouldnt become the same letter. Decryption isnt my strong suit. Wild speculation is my strong suit lol
