Hello everyone hope everyone is having a blast in the search for Raxxla. I figure I share something that strike me as interesting but never thought about it up until today when I realized something I read about a couple of days ago. Maybe it's way out there but obviously this discussions always lead to covering the galaxy with tinfoil. I like to go back to the Raxxla codex a certain paragraph that struck me as odd but maybe overlooked.



As we all know we dug deep into the books " Astrophil and Stella " which to me is my opinion is far from being a childern's book actually it is quite the opposite of that. It was actually a love tell of a man enamored with a women.

To me seems like this paragraph is pushing for the idea that the Mandela Effect is being put into play.

I think you’re right friend. Rebecca seems to hint at this as well, although that could just be her mind being warped but she does say she feels as though something is missing. “Remember” is something that keeps being repeated to us over and over. Keep up the good insight!

Back to the ferweh thing Peter came across. I took was was left in translated and messed with it.

“Welcome to zyonhutjaq Monnz”
Q is not in the Igbo alphabet and I removed an N. This could be a stretch but I got: “Welcome to Zyon see the Hell”. Idk this stuffs weird I’m not an Igbo linguist and there’s no set pattern of what to remove or where to put spaces. Calling someone that speaks Igbo! Lol google translate is cancer.

This all reeks of confirmation bias it can’t be right.
