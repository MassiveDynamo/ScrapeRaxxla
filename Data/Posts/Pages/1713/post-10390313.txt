Why would they ( Frontier ) just do such a thing and then sit by idle twisting their evil mustache just watching the playerbase posting everyday in this nearly 2000 page thread?

Customer psychology. Place something out of reach, announce that you have done so, and people will flock around trying to get at it. I'm sure some evil mustache-twiddling even now takes place over the Cobra Mk IV., out of reach to everyone except early buyers of the game, if the old promise still holds.

Compare the CIA Kryptos, 'released' in the early 1990s, and (as far as I know) not solved completely yet. It was predicted to be solved in ten years ...
