Sorry but who is "Drew" again?
Drew Wagar. He wrote the books Reclamation and Premonition. He was also very involved with lore for an fan-project (really a reimagined version of the older games) known as Oolite. He made a fabulous lore primer: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlDouuF9NmkdfX2__u858LrLYUVehjZfg&si=8KLSKQjKW5Roje1R
