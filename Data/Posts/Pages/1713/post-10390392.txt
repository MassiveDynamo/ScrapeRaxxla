Unfortunately in order to find the Raxxla at some point you've got to stop making things up you want to be true, stop hypothesising about what you think would be cool, or endlessly complaining about how Fdev dropped the ball or cancelled plans for some epic storylines etc. and look at what's actually there in-game.
Thank you for saying this. This is partly why I always have tried to anchor ideas firmly to the game either via lore, science, or locations provably in the game. Finding this isn't looking to be an easy task either. Even work on Sol -> Achenar from 2197-2296 proved that there are enough surprises in the game that it being claimed, "it must be in the Human Bubble," is on very shaky ground given Hydrogen and Hydrogen-derived fuels and fuel scoops. Then there's that nightmare that is Capella and the group going with Marlin Duval eventually reaching Achenar (as what sounds like stragglers). That doesn't even factor in supposedly the Empire is founded in 2296 yet lacks an Emperor until the 2320s.

So, we have Schr√∂dinger's Grave, does Capella contain Marlin Duval's death location because Raxxla was found somewhere nearby or is it another Duval. The system is Federal so it really, really shouldn't have a body named Nobleworld.

I do not post this to hurt anyone's ideas. It is strictly to illustrate that certainty is not on our side. We need evidence, we need testable ideas based on provable facts. That isn't something we have lots of at the moment.
