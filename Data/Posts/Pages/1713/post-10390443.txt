The Codex is now ultimately the primary source. Or whatever is left ‘in game’, which may/may not add some context.
Until the community finishes uncovering the remaining ( estimated ) 98.1% of the coded universe, my personal albeit newb-ish search for the mystery of "Raxxla" continues.

This is partly why I always have tried to anchor ideas firmly to the game either via lore, science, or locations provably in the game.
i'm sticking with the "locations in the game" option , combined with the Codex entries.

It's the easiest to disect and the most plausible to discern , in my humble opinion.
