At least one permit is known to be not controlled by the in game faction.

Polaris - is intentionally locked by FD. They confirmed it and other areas are simply not accessible so there is no mechanism to access them.

I think this is simply a conflation between in game reality and real life, and this can be established easily in game by seeing if the permit says ‘unknown’. FD are utilising the mechanic to lock off areas from us on purpose due to either historical or future narrative reasons. They simply can not be obtained.
