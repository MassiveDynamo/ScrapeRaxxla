It would be nice to consider such a system is perfect and every event includes an all encompassing mythos but, that is open to interpretation, I accept it has limitations and that ultimately some of mythos is ‘esoteric’ or simply evidence of environmental storytelling and not directly interactive.

FD has confirmed they park content, FD has confirmed they inject content irrespective of its environment, FD confirmed there exists content some Devs simply don’t know anything about, or complicated to keep track of and also that certain references made by them are not intended to be literal, but actual allusions to wider environmental storytelling.
What environmental story? You practically dismissed anything that might be useful or interesting.

I didn't think you would possibly come back with such a myopic and depressing take but here we are. So, according to you, there is not a place called Hope. According to you, there is absolutely zero logic behind placement of systems or factions and functionally the old lore doesn't even matter. Damn, that is a depressing take on things.

Delphi is the center of things because of an organization by the name of J-Corp (or as it is better known presently Janus Incorporated).

There is actually a place called Hope. Maybe you should take a break and get your head in a better place. We're trying to find something that was found at least 1,014 years ago if not longer ago. It doesn't matter if it is a rumor or it's a place in the current era. Find some threads to investigate and use them and see how far you can get with an idea. But please, do more than complain without actually applying ideas to larger context. There are secretive groups that may or may not have found something important, there any ancient corporations hellbent on controlling key areas of the galaxy. If you honestly cannot come up something useful from all this, you aren't really trying.
