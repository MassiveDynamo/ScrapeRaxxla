Customer psychology. Place something out of reach, announce that you have done so, and people will flock around trying to get at it.
In my experience, DEVS ( coders ) much more enjoy having players actually discover what they've worked so hard to code & bury thru Codex & hints.

Sure, they might try to milk the mystery for as long as possible , but they would also want/wish ( obvervationally ) for someone to eventually finally make the discovery real.

i will concede, it's also possible that "Raxxla" might signify something less tangible. Like "the journey" or "the search" or whatever.

But it just seems way too farfeched imo to presume that level of cruelty from Frontier , on purpose , toward their own community.

What would they have to gain? Making a handful of players in a long forum thread waste time or be miserable? Nah . Makes zero sense imo. Because of simple fact that we've only uncovered supposedly barely approaching 0.10% of what they've coded.

i've read a significant amount of this entire thread, but sorry i haven't read all 1700+ pages , so would you happen to have the page link for that exact reference?

The missions were ‘removed’. No context given.
Again i'm sorry for being sorta new around here and re-treading old topics , but exactly which "missions" are you referring?
