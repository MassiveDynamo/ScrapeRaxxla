Well said.

The Codex is now ultimately the primary source. Or whatever is left ‘in game’, which may/may not add some context.

There are various approaches to various text in here, and no one is explicitly correct nor necessarily false, however I would argue a degree of insight has identified various anomalous data might hold relevance, but and it’s always a big but, such ‘backcasting’ has to alway be weighed with a breezeblock of salt, and not held up as the philosophers stone.

What does it add, is it a dead end…is it false, move on.

I do believe the older DW missions were the original intended script. That’s just a matter of opinion based upon the textural information provided at that time. We don’t actually know where those would have originally taken us, if anywhere. That’s guess work, we can speculate, nothing more. In any regard its ancient history.

But the point being such elements have been proven to have be removed. That provides insight, namely we can identify an area of the game which does not require scrutiny, snd move on, and that it identifies an element of FD general modus operandi which helps us understand why.

Moot point really, most of this is covered in page one.
