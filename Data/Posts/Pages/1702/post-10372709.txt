Anybody tried out the new Python yet?

I wonder if it was all the ship's snake names that reminded MB of Paradise Lost?
Yes I have...
It's going to be my principle Pirate hunter/CZ ship now once I get the weapons up to snuff.
Love the way it flies and handles, but I don't think it will make a very good exploration ship. Internals are a bit limited...
