As for the Raxxla logo indicating a station that provides some kind of gateway to a parallel universe - every station does that.

Each time people log into solo or private group modes or an open instance, they are effectively in another universe.
And each time they affect the BGS, trade on the market, hand in combat bonds or sell exploration data, a gateway to other universes is used.
This gateway can transfer goods on the market, modify the BGS and tag bodies with commanders' names - and people in other universes can observe the effect.
The stations form gateways to all parallel universes.

Raxxla could be the handwavium to explain different game modes and instances.
I don't like the idea very much, though.
In my opinion, finding Raxxla should involve jumping around for no apparent reason, hoping to find some rare visuals.
Assembling a bunch of words may add some spice to the journey, but it can hardly be the goal.
