Per the Knowledge base, though, we have this: "According to self-professed Dark Wheel expert Lyta Crane, a conspiracy theorist and 'people's journalist' who has painstakingly assembled an archive of relevant data, the original group was based in a disused starport orbiting the eighth moon of an unnamed gas giant. The station was toroid, hence 'wheel', and operated with a minimal power output so as to avoid detection, hence 'dark'.

Toroidal pretty much torpedoes it being an Iconic Coriolis. Toroid would be approximately donut-shaped. I think we are looking for a Stanford Torus.

Extending this to the Omphalos Rift and stretching the structure with 6 giant pylons with the exterior side covered solar panels and the interior covered in living space (basis is Raxxla logo) and you get Citadel from Mass Effect or something exceedingly similar.

Despite it paradoxically being a newer station design than Coriolis, the Orbis station was determined in the past to be an exact match of the codex image for TDW including toroidal living structure. To me this communicates that TDW station is separate from what Raxxla is and so the logo is an entirely different beast to decipher.



Of course, there is a chance the codex station image is a red herring and FDev just picked a similar station to the description but I feel like that would be too clumsy or misleading considering the difficult task of finding such a stealthy object.
