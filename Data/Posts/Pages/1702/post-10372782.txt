Yes, Raxxla built into a station might be the whole point of the logo...resembling one view of a Coriolis dodecahedral station, and that is the oldest type of station.
I don't think it is a human station. The Coriolis isn't developed until the 2700s (four centuries too late). Pilot's Federation launched in 2805. Lave is first full-size one in 2752. The prototype is developed in Vetitice (Facece) prior to that.



Funny, I thought The Club conspiracy would be able to remember their own version of history. Shibboleths are wonderful little things. They seem so innocuous but are so good at locating the outsiders amongst us.
