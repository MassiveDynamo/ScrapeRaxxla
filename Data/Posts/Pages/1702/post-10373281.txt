It opens with the ship flying past the silhouetted lettering.

Ironically it’s little things like this, that tempt me to flip back to PC and 4.0, from Legacy not necessarily EDO. My old backers dino is rotting in dry doc. Ironically I rather enjoy Legacy now, it’s nice and quiet and feels like the ‘old’ Elite, which technically it is but it’s nice to see the title look a little smatter.
