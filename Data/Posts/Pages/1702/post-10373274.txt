Despite it paradoxically being a newer station design than Coriolis, the Orbis station was determined in the past to be an exact match of the codex image for TDW including toroidal living structure. To me this communicates that TDW station is separate from what Raxxla is and so the logo is an entirely different beast to decipher.

Of course, there is a chance the codex station image is a red herring and FDev just picked a similar station to the description but I feel like that would be too clumsy or misleading considering the difficult task of finding such a stealthy object.
The extent of obfuscation around Raxxla has become fairly evident during @Rochester 's analysis of the Paradise Lost cosmology embodied in-game. The codex TDW entry phrasing around "Lyta Crane"' heavily suggests that may be false, or at least intentionally misleading.

To my knowledge FD have never explicitly said that the "DW Orbis" picture (that image is obviously heavily manipulated-see earlier discussion in this thread) and the "Raxxla logo" are valid nor representative, or in any way pertinent - that is our assumption. Even if TDW station is real and in-game (I'm not at all convinced...I suspect that whole storyline was deleted) the image of an Orbis could be intentional obfuscation that it is actually a Coriolis, which could make more sense against the lore given the purported age of TDW and the introduction date for more recent station types.
Caution young padawan, suspicion is a necessary attribute in a Questor!
