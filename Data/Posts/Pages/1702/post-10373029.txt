Yes, Raxxla built into a station might be the whole point of the logo...resembling one view of a Coriolis dodecahedral station, and that is the oldest type of station.
Just a question. I considered the alioth wiki to be a good resource for knowledge about the old games. But about the dodecahedron station, it says:
The Dodecahedral GalCop space station design (the so-called "Dodo") replaced the older Coriolis design in the more advanced systems. […]
1st the Dodecahedral stations are made of pentagons. These IMHO do not fit so well with the Raxxla logo. And which one is the old design? Coriolis / Dodecahedral?
And if alioth wiki is correct and the Coriolis is the old one, why do we only find those in ED but none of the newer Dodecahedral stations??? – OK retcon. But can I trust alioth wiki about the old stuff?
Read properly first, then ask! (never mind)
