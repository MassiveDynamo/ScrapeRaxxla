So I have been looking at Horizons… and it has sent me back over well traveled paths … Bear with me here.

To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies!

Taking this in context - it is fairly obvious what this is… so i will address this last.

To the whisperer in witchspace, the siren of the deepest void!

This references several things - one, the sounds in witchspace. Two, the sirens in Holdstocks book. Three, the Sirens in Greek Myth - specifically the Odyssey, and The Myth of Er in the Republic. - The call of exploration and its inherent dangers…

The parent's grief, the lover's woe, and the yearning of our vagabond hearts. To Raxxla!

Specifically speaking to the family woes of Odysseus. The grief induced suicide of his mother and the grief stricken life of his father.

The lovers woe I assume is related to the struggles his wife has.

The yearning of our vagabond hearts would indicate a desire to explore…. But we know that Odysseus wanted nothing more than to return…. Home.

And now back to the Jewel on the brow…

There is an overarching theme to the narrative arc of ED and i think it might be The Odyssey…

Quoting from the Odyssey:

But when the Star of Eve with golden light
Adorn’d the matron brow of sable night…

The evening star being of course Hesperus… Venus….. Lucifer ( technically the morning star… but ya vesper doesnt work)

So to be clear I am looking for the Dark Wheel here. And i see two obvious search targets….Venus and Lucifer.

The garden axis could be construed to fit the Sirius system….

I know we have looked at Sirius from the beginning- but i dont ever recollect us doing a hard search around Lucifer for a dark station. Could it be the station we keep seeing at the startscreen? - might be worth a look.
