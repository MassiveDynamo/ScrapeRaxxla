I fear this is true, since now these things are on my mind. RNG knows... I feel taunted to have these show up when they did, but oh well. I'll pop into a few nav beacons (If I'm not mistaken, these things drop from trader/smugglers, so a RES is a no go) and see what comes to me. Worst comes to worst, I make some money off of bounties!

Edit: Turns out they're not too rare after all! Or, I continue to be very lucky. Anyway, I have 4 of them - 3 to fill all spots around the structure plus a spare. I went to Bunda, a lawless system, and ignored my better angels while I sat cargo scanning anyone who looked like they were carrying things (not PP ships or people trying to scan for piracy). This included ships like Sidewinders, Adders, Haulers, Keelbacks, Type-6/7/9's, and some Asp X's. I forget if I ever found trinkets on an Asp Scout. Anyway, had I been able to secure every Trinket I came across, I would have had around a hundred by now! But a lot of the ships had the gall to blow up too quickly... and of course, I only have so much space in my Vulture.

I'm transferring to my AspX now to head out and grab a UA, and maybe a UP if I feel like it. Then I'll bring them all to a site and see what happens, if anything.

One last thing - it may or may not be significant that Bunda is within 20ly of Shinrarta Dezhra, and also spawns trinket-carriers quite often. But I only have one data point.
