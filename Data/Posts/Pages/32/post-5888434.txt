Happy not Labor Day Meatbags!!

Just our weekly check in. We went to one of our old sites and activated it, downloaded the battle plan...erm...star map, and helped fertilize a few of the eggs. Can't let those "scavengers" have all the fun can we? During our journeys we have no new info on Raxxla, but we do have a lead to check on once we figure out where the constellation Orion is in game. For now, we are preparing for a storm.
