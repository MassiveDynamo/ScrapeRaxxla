Raxxla was supposed to be a planet, not a star or system. You'll need to do a system search and scan all bodies in each of those systems (asteroids too); there is some suggestion that not all bodies are detectable by ADS so you might need to do an eyeball parallax search too.

Apologies...apparently I didn't put enough pips to my sarcasm font.

I understand what it is I am looking for. I ran around the system a bit, honked here and there...the only thing there was the brown dwarf.

Great work. Which of them is this?

Phooe bRA XX-L A76-0


It was the furthest out from Jacques. I figured I'd go all the way out and then break up the return trip with the other three.
