Trinkets of Hidden Fortune do not appear to have any interaction with the Thargoid tech - they are not accepted by the device. No other ideas on what to do with them currently; seems like they're just relics of old bulletin board missions that don't get offered anymore until further notice.

+1.

Wanted to try with Sap 8 Core Containers, but sadly haven't found any yet. Just Hafnium 178 & Antiquities from the Convoys.
