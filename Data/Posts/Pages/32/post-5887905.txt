A brown dwarf.

I'll keep checking the other sites.

Raxxla was supposed to be a planet, not a star or system. You'll need to do a system search and scan all bodies in each of those systems (asteroids too); there is some suggestion that not all bodies are detectable by ADS so you might need to do an eyeball parallax search too.

Trinkets of Hidden Fortune do not appear to have any interaction with the Thargoid tech - they are not accepted by the device. No other ideas on what to do with them currently; seems like they're just relics of old bulletin board missions that don't get offered anymore until further notice.

Repped for trying. Perhaps you should buy a couple of lottery tickets, just in case! (Get me some too!! )
