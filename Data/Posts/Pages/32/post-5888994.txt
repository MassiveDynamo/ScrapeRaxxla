there is some suggestion that not all bodies are detectable by ADS so you might need to do an eyeball parallax search too.

Is this suggestion anything more concrete than spitballing a way to hide a planet?
It came up as a concept a few times in the Rift thread but was only ever speculation. I'm wondering if there's any more meat on it regarding Raxxal.
