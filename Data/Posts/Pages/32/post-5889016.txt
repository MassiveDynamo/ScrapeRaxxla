Wanted to try with Sap 8 Core Containers, but sadly haven't found any yet. Just Hafnium 178 & Antiquities from the Convoys.

Oooohhh, that's a good idea. I'll have to be on the lookout for those as well. I suppose there's a good chance that with them being under the umbrella of cannisters as well, it'll have the same non-effect, but unlike the trinkets which apparently are just human "knick knacks and statuettes" with some hidden message, the supposed crystals may lore-wise be capable of reacting....

Maybe if it doesn't accept it, try dropping the container into the beam created by popping in a guardian relic. I'm pretty sure it is well-established as just a particle effect with heat damage, but hey, if at that point the container isn't picked up by the device, might as well let it go out with a bang.
