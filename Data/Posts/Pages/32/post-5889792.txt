Apologies...apparently I didn't put enough pips to my sarcasm font.

I understand what it is I am looking for. I ran around the system a bit, honked here and there...the only thing there was the brown dwarf.

It was the furthest out from Jacques. I figured I'd go all the way out and then break up the return trip with the other three.

Ah sorry, my eyes aren't attuned to sarcasm font until at least the second coffee & at the time I had only just started the first!

But it may be worth doing a parallax search, since I have a feeling it was DB that said not all things can be detected by ADS, and Raxxla is just the thing to be hidden

Oh I don't know. Things have gone so quiet of late a little distraction might be welcome!
