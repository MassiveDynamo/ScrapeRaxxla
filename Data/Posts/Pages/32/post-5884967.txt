SPOILER

Was doing some bounty hunting for the CG when these old things popped... was quite disappointed with myself for not having cargo space. Will need to pop on a rack to pick them up next time I find them.

Has anyone tested one of these with the Thargoid Sites? It's a longshot, but who knows. Also, do missions for these still get handed out (not sure if they fell only under the umbrella of the missions Macros documented)?

You lucky lucky man!
except not as no racks-
you may never find one again!
(In 2 years of play I've never come across one)
