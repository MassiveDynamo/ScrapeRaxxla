Is this suggestion anything more concrete than spitballing a way to hide a planet?
It came up as a concept a few times in the Rift thread but was only ever speculation. I'm wondering if there's any more meat on it regarding Raxxal.

I vaguely remember the comment being made but not the exact phrasing, possibly in a livestream; think it was by DB but it might have been MB.
