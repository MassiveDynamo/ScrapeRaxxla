SPOILER

Was doing some bounty hunting for the CG when these old things popped... was quite disappointed with myself for not having cargo space. Will need to pop on a rack to pick them up next time I find them.

Has anyone tested one of these with the Thargoid Sites? It's a longshot, but who knows. Also, do missions for these still get handed out (not sure if they fell only under the umbrella of the missions Macros documented)?
