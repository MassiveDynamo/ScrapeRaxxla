Is this suggestion anything more concrete than spitballing a way to hide a planet?
It came up as a concept a few times in the Rift thread but was only ever speculation. I'm wondering if there's any more meat on it regarding Raxxal.

As far as I know its only speculations, but it would be very easy to do implementation wise, could fit into the lore (at least how I understand it) and I think this way FD could hide Raxxla close to the bubble. Fortunately we can test this theory with a certain planet we know should exist in a certain system but is not there. Maybe after 2.4, when I get bored of whatever happens Targoid-wise, I use the new 10k plot distance to go back to the rift and spend some time looking...
