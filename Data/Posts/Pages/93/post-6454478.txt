So the Oolite Saga is not 3304 canon, and "there will be no clues".

Let's find some things we do know:
Assumptions:
- The trip to and from Raxxla, assuming it has been found before - likely not by TDW - would likely be within the span of an adult lifespan.

- Raxxla has been around pre-dating human probably human spaceflight/human civilization.

- it is surface based, not orbital

- it will likely not be in a system capable of producing a viable ELW or similarly habitable world

- it is not of Thargoid origin, but likely sought out by the Thargoid races.

- the only reward for discovering Raxxla will be bragging rights

Facts:
The TDW faction is not TDW

The Thargoids are disabling/wrecking stations rather than obliterating them - a strategy to distract the Bubble from getting in the way of them outrunning their Klaxxian agressors. They are travelling in an indirect path through the Bubble.

- Soontil was not Raxxla
