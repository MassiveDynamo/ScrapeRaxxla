Yeah... Best bet is to take a look at Sol, and see which planets are not landable based on their 'thin' atmosphere - Mars might be a good bet. You can then look at the landables like Enceladus etc. and see what the atmosphere percentages are. We can't count the moon, because technically I think it's landable because of it's low atmosphere, but FD want to map it so that is an exact copy - that's what I heard, not sure if that's the real reason...

Post edit: I didn't realise Mars had been terraformed in-game, so we can't check for it's (current real-life) percentage in-game.

Hmm, so Exbeur 1 says No Atmosphere, but does have a very slight surface pressure, 0.0004 Atmospheres. Presumably it's just down to a difference in the rounding used for the No Atmosphere status versus the one used for landable status.
