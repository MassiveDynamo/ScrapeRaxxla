The 'Architect' also mentions the split of the CIEP and Dark Wheel being a few years back and at that time Raxxla had not been found. Time has passed so the Architects information could be out of data.

The Admiral 'Psycho'Kowsky has also been in hiding for many years, so his data could also be out of date, but was correct as of when he went into hiding.

Or was it????
