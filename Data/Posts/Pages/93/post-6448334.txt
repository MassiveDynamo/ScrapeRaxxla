So like me, Doc, you think that the What was lost will soon be found refers to the black boxes and not to the Raxxla location ? (6th Elite/Founders mission)

When it comes to Raxxla ... I think a great many things simultaneously even though they are mutually exclusive from each other. It is too broad a subject to limit the possibilities. You very well may be right about the black boxes.
