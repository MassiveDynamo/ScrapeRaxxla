I think that John Harper actually confirms that TDW never found Raxxla, in this post: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showt...in-spoilers)?p=6366667&viewfull=1#post6366667
Actually... John Harper wrote a book in which the INRA Admiral tells the hero-of-the-story that TDW never found Raxxla. The Admiral might have been lying or might have incorrect information. We need toconsider the character and their potential limits of knowledge with anything written in official fiction.
