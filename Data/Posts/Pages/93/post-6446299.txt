As I read the above post, I thought of a perfect hiding spot for Raxxla. It would make it possible to be in game, while being impossible to find.
Inside a gas giant. Could the dark wheel have created the grandest cloaking scheme ever?

Everything we know about The Dark Wheel indicates that they went looking for Raxxla. We have no evidence that they ever found it. If Raxxla has been cloaked it isn't The Dark Wheel's doing.
