Everything we know about The Dark Wheel indicates that they went looking for Raxxla. We have no evidence that they ever found it. If Raxxla has been cloaked it isn't The Dark Wheel's doing.

I think that John Harper actually confirms that TDW never found Raxxla, in this post: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showt...in-spoilers)?p=6366667&viewfull=1#post6366667
