Everything we know about The Dark Wheel indicates that they went looking for Raxxla. We have no evidence that they ever found it. If Raxxla has been cloaked it isn't The Dark Wheel's doing.

So like me, Doc, you think that the What was lost will soon be found refers to the black boxes and not to the Raxxla location ? (6th Elite/Founders mission)
