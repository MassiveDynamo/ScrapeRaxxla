I'm currently 1.65ly from Juemae WC-E C1-437 with the nose pointed directly at the signal. I haven't had to adjust course in the last .35lys. I think I have to be in the system that this signal is tied to. I've heard that we can't supercruise into the next system. Come to find out, I'm heading closer to Stuemeae JM-W C1-5825 So I think I will not find anything as I have started from a different system. I also think that IF the L. signal has been found, those explorers have been asked to be silent. I just can't imagine I'm the only mug out here doing what I am doing.
