Wow I was looking into Shamash while working on the images too!
A sun god but also a divine judge of the dead / underworld - a Satan-like figure?. There is a stone tablet of him, known as a Stele or Stela. Some even have spirals
If there is a Sin and Ishtar system anywhere nearby that would be very interesting.
I'm not sure of it's relative position, but there is definitely a system named Sin. I think it's pretty close to Mbooni and Viracocha
