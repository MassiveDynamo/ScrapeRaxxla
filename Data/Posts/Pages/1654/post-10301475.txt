I have an update for you
Each sphere could be a 'zoomed-in' inner layer of Milton's description - The Cosmos, The Universe, and Earth.

Some of these connections / relationships are certainly based on me trying to "fit" his model with this design as well as seeing parallels with the ancient hebrew / old testament ideas, so it's more of an experiment.

System Info
System:
Station:
Notable Factions: - contains all FSD injection materials
Astronomical identifiers: HD 24583, TYC 2365-2062-1, USNO-A2 1200-01839264, located in the Perseus constellation.

- Path runs from Heaven [Sphere 1] to enter the sphere of the cosmos [2], through the Jasper Sea, onto Earth [3], and down to the gates of Hell / Underworld.
- Satan's Journey (right to left) from Hell (the door is runic Haglaz / Hail / Hagl (sounds like Hell and the door "loops" from the hell side of Milton's cosmos to leave Hell), through the Chasm / Void of Chaos to Earth, the Pavilion of chaos (small circle?), 'over' the Universe, to The Empyrean / Heaven.





The question is, does it relate to anything in the game if the designers chose to represent this idea?
1. The pragmatic answer - it is a fictional celebration of Humanity's creation mythology turned into a garden landscape for tourists to enjoy. OR
2. It is a direct reference to Milton's pendent world - reinforced by MB's final tourist beacon reference. It is a clue for Raxxla. Which begs the question:
How are the other garden rooms related, if at all? Can they be tied by a common theme?

Personally I believe it’s a real Miltonian Cosmological model and it’s represented in game.
Hopefully this provides some inspiration as it came from Michael Brookes (R.I.P.), himself - Paradise Lost - The greatest story ever told
