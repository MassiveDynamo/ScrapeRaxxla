I’ve identified in the image above that that Norse Norns, Greek Fates and the Morrigans may represent an area between the Empyrean and Chaos. This just so happens to be the location of the Shamash systems.

If we are to take the Miltonian graphic as accurate it’s possible then that Milton’s Paradise aka our Raxxla ought to be in this general area?
Wow I was looking into Shamash while working on the images too!
A sun god but also a divine judge of the dead / underworld - a Satan-like figure?. There is a stone tablet of him, known as a Stele or Stela. Some even have spirals
If there is a Sin and Ishtar system anywhere nearby that would be very interesting.
