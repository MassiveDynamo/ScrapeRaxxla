I'm currently 1.65ly from Juemae WC-E C1-437 with the nose pointed directly at the signal. I haven't had to adjust course in the last .35lys. I think I have to be in the system that this signal is tied to. I've heard that we can't supercruise into the next system. Come to find out, I'm heading closer to Stuemeae JM-W C1-5825 So I think I will not find anything as I have started from a different system. I also think that IF the L. signal has been found, those explorers have been asked to be silent. I just can't imagine I'm the only mug out here doing what I am doing.

Did a similar experiment in Aug. 2020
From STUEMEAE JM-W C1-5825 several hour Supercruise in a straight line, but no change from where to where the signal was detectable.
Also a 16 hour Session from STUEMEAE KM-W C1-7529 same result. Turned ~90Â° and another hour no change.
That close to the source it should have a noticeable Parallax. Had done more Systems with shorter Sessions due to the realization that Parallax should be a thing that close. But no System had shown any sings of Parallax. If i remember correctly i may have never tried a System in a different Boxel like JUENAE. Hope you have better luck.
