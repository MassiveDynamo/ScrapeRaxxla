Anyone try the planet 9 theory?

Planet Nine is a hypothetical planet in the outer region of the Solar System. Its gravitational effects could explain the peculiar clustering of orbits for a group of extreme trans-Neptunian objects, bodies beyond Neptune that orbit the Sun at distances averaging more than 250 times that of the Earth. Wikipedia
Semi-major axis: 460+160; −100 AU
Eccentricity: 0.2–0.5
Perihelion: 340+80; −70 AU
Apparent magnitude: ~21
Inclination: 16±5°
Aphelion: 560+260; −140 AU
Orbital period (sidereal): 9,900+5,500; −3,100 yr

Location

Located beyond Neptune, the supposed home of Planet 9, the Kuiper belt, consists of icy bodies ranging in size from large boulders to objects with diameters greater than 1,000 miles. These objects are material left over from the earliest era of the solar system that was never incorporated into the forming planets.
