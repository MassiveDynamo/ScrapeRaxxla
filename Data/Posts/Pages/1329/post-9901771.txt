To confirm the above findings, here is another response from FD on the subject about the tip-off missions.

I am at pains to utilise such a method to clarify what is / what is not in game, but it is a valid method of obtaining information.

I don’t feel contacting Support is invalid, and I’ve only done so to clarify what is / what is not a waste of our time. If false perception generated by the community or through poor communication leads a player to unnecessarily expend their time, and in some cases at their detriment, I think it only an issue of health and safety that such issues are clarified.

In short djadjok is correct and these tip off mission are not related to the Mysterious Benefactor from the manual.
