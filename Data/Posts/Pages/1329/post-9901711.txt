Following my breakfast hypothesising about TDW in the old worlds, and “mysterious stranger tip-off missions, I have read through djadjok’s posts on the subject. To summarise, he didnt think they are related to TDW. Relevant info is:
Tip-offs are a direct result of completing a mission (Dom Corner). TO often need to scan (only) core data terminal, the core data terminal is always the one with the green beacon up in the sky, using your ship you must really poke the terminal with the nose. tip offs are kind of payoffs or a form of "gratitude" from a minor faction to a given commander for a long-lasted profitable collaboration & usually received upon completion of missions while docked at station.


Djadjok’s TO mission latest:

#124



#127


#179

TO message location co-ordinates are for Horizons. In Odyssey most things on planet surfaces have moved slightly, so you have to go to the co-ordinates then look in the nav panel for the closest installation or crash site.

doing evacuations from burning stations and rep+ missions so far looks like a natural choice for Tip Off grinding, though disabling megaship turrets may currently be the fastest way to obtain many tip off in a short period of time.
