Tip-off missions weren't present in the game at release. They were added post-Horizons, so it seems unlikely that they're related to either TDW or Raxxla.
There was no mention of the DW station at release either. That came with the Codex. Tip-offs could relate to that part of the quest.

Also there could be more than one way to skinn this cat. More options could have been added, without removing the original method.
