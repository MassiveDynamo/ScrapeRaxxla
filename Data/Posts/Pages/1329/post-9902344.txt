Quite so! It does explicitly mention a test. However it also reads like an advert for PowerPlay, which didnt exist on game release. Moreover from the Codex “The Dark Wheel is the name given to a legendary group of adventurers, explorers, investigators and treasure-hunters”, and I don't see how that fits with “movers and shakers”, “shape the galaxy around them” or “create change on a grand scale”. Which is why I suspect it is fluff, and TDW may also be fluff.

We have confirmation from DB and MB that Raxxla is in-game (though we don’t know what it is), but we have no such confirmation for TDW; the codex entry is very ambiguous, especially wrt Lyta Crane.
