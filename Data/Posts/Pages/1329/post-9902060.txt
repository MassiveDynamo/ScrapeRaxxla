But never really mentions the chances that this "Mysterious Stranger" isn't from the same unknown organization if the case the Benefactor isn't one in the same. We have to be watched by someone or multiple people each time we finish a mission. In regards to #179 it's possible and most likely Influence plays the part of the in getting tip offs based on my experience. As I said before, my first day of doing missions I had gotten 2 tip offs due to the fact I gotten the missions that made it really easy to move up in Rank for the Federation while I was trying to earn my Corvette this wasn't full days worth of mission grinding. On my 2nd day I only manage to get 1 tip off due to the fact of lack of courier missions all day.

But maybe an hidden system where it looks for certain amount of points that attributes to getting the tip off Ex. for every 3000 points made you gain a tip off. But is it faction related it can also play a part in what type of tips off we earn. It can be old world related + faction plays in a role in this system if you know where to search for it.

It's also possible that there is a pool of tip offs that each faction pulls from. So for instance Federation may pull from this pool of tip offs, Imperial pulls from this pool ( could be the same) as well as Alliance. While the specific minor factions not related to galactic power can pull from the very rare pool tip offs.
