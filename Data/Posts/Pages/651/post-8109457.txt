Careful, all this talk of Thargoids and their science may lead to an uncomfortable conclusion about Raxxla...

â€¦.and f it is that Fdev Change It NOW! coz we will all complain 100% if that is the answer and some of us will feel more insulted than if we never find it...Raxxla is too important for a CG or II type thing thank you.
DB will be fine with no one finding Raxxla. The myth is probably of more value to the Elite universe, than the actuall mystery.
