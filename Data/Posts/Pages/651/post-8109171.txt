Just out of curiosity... did we get anything from the Thargoid Sensor besides the fact it points to Merope and that morse code that would draw the ship carrying it?
UA/TS will Morse the local system / body / station name. It does this until it scans our ship.
It does not scan SRVs, so at the crash sites keeps doing the name Morsing.
