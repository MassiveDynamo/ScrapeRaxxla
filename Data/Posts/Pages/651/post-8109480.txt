UA/TS will Morse the local system / body / station name. It does this until it scans our ship.
It does not scan SRVs, so at the crash sites keeps doing the name Morsing.

Thanks, mate! The funny part is that the Thargoid Sensor will scan my ship as soon I drop it...

Does it resume morse code the current location if I fly off of it by 1km?
