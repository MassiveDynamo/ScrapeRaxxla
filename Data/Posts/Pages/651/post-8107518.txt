Ok so I've been reading 'And Here the Wheel' and Smuggler's Junction made me wonder about what kinda of things might actually be hidden in the asteroid belts in some systems. Does anyone remember the way Robert Garry uses specifically shaped asteroids that act as nav points to get there? Has anyone looked around for similar things in the the belts we have?

Just a thought, however I'd really like if anyone has insight to this. Realistically, I'm no explorer. I'm a combat pilot acting as a space trucker.
