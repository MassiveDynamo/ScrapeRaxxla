Ok so I've been reading 'And Here the Wheel' and Smuggler's Junction made me wonder about what kinda of things might actually be hidden in the asteroid belts in some systems. Does anyone remember the way Robert Garry uses specifically shaped asteroids that act as nav points to get there? Has anyone looked around for similar things in the the belts we have?

Just a thought, however I'd really like if anyone has insight to this. Realistically, I'm no explorer. I'm a combat pilot acting as a space trucker.
Used to scan them all but not drop in and eyeball them prior to the FSS.
Now if you scan one they all complete. Lame mechanic but saves time.

[Edit: Never seen any with space hermits, graffiti or other signals of life.]
