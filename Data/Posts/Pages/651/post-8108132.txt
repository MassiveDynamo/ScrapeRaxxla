I was thinking more of the belts without a planet.

Also has anyone been to a system where the entry point was a Lagrange cloud instead of a star? Just like the the black hole system entry points but with a cloud instead.


Was it hackable?

Are you sure that exists? I think system entry points have to be in the Star Class, donâ€™t think Lagrange Clouds are
