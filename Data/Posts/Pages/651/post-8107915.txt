If you're looking for something in an asteorid belt (of a planet), I'd suggest to search for the Octavia's Base (secret pirate station with clues to Raxxla) because there are very few asteroid types and I wouldn't count on it to point me anywhere.

To throw you something to bug you out, try to scan Saturn and its rings or the Shinrarta Dezhra AB 2 J ring... let me know if you see the same odd things as I did.

If I remember corectly Octaviaâ€™s base is in-game but not landable, and there are no clues to Raxxla.
