In Paradise Lost Satan exists Hel via Hells Gate, guarded by Sinn and Death. Who follow Satan and build a bridge through Chaos. When the gates are opened Milton states the base of chaos shook with the sound, in the text he alludes to it as Erebus, synonymous as a location in Greek mythology as a place one must pass through to reach the underworld.

Just spitballing but… following ingame narrative - The impetuous recoile and jarring sound of the gates of hell opening … might be the sound of “Salvations” Device being turned on in HIP 22460.
