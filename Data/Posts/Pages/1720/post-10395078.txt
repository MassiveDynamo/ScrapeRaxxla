Key locations in or near Alioth:
Golden Gate (station)
Bifrost (gas giant)
Nearby is the system Bilfrost.

These are pretty heavy allusions to Heaven. So, are Heaven and Empyrean the same place?

Milton’s Cosmology Leaned Heliocentric
It’s a home day for me with the flu, so to recover from a long day of videoconferencing meetings, and because a headache won’t let me concentrate on important stuff, I played around with an idea I wrote up as a high school English project. Milton wrote the epic Paradise Lost, in which he...

@Rochester Which "zone" is Alioth located? I just found something crazy with two factions (0 population for no obvious reasons). As in these factions may be entirely cyborg. One of the factions, New Growth Party, shares a name with an asteroid base in Pencil Sector. Based on recent discussions, the cyborgs could be the evil unleashed by our actions. Alioth was also the original home of Achilles Corporation and there is a tourism beacon in Facece to back that up.

My message from several discords:
FYI: Alioth appears to be a hotbed of cyborgs. As you know, we just had that attack on an Achilles Corporation facility in Alioth. There are two factions reporting 0 population that are natives: Independent Constitution Party ( https://inara.cz/elite/minorfaction/15426/ ) and New Growth. Party ( https://inara.cz/elite/minorfaction/32683/ ). Isn't New Growth an asteroid base https://inara.cz/elite/station/59384/ ), too? Yes, it is. So, Alioth is officially very, very weird.

Commentary:
If I was to guess, doing tourism missions out of Irkutsk in Alioth for New Growth Party may lead to interesting places. Yes, I say Irkutsk for a reason - it is a station and thus connected to darker parts of the series lore.
