google search showed Sheila/Sheela as a dragon name, however the system name is not a subanagram of "Princess Astrophel.."
Not quite a dragon - a gargoyle form of the closest human equivalent - the "divine feminine". This might go a long way to explain the Elite series slight obsession with extremely strong women. The strongest force in the Universe is love not fear. Love conquors all. It was a lesson that I had to learn early. Some battles must be fought alone - no one but you and your wits against the entire Universe.
