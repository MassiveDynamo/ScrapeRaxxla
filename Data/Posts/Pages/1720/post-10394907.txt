MB response: “It was more of a spiritual successor than a direct sequel. We did look at a story involving Raxxla, but felt that was a story that should be played out in game rather than as a novel.”

So the Raxxla storyline is in-game. Therefore we don't need any external books, all the necessary clues will be embedded for those with eyes to see, & IMO any external sources are likely to be irrelevant

I don't think anything other than that is needed. .
This. Never truer words have been spoken.
