Some Revised thoughts -

What if we are the Devils Horde....


Merope - sitting on the edge of circumferenced world - Paradise?

The Unknown Artefacts (thargoid sensors) - Mighty Cherubim ... guarding the Garden of Eden.

Thargoids - I assume are Angels?

The Map from the Codex showing a line going down vaguely towards Barnards Loop - the Golden Chain

The Empyrean being at the Galactic Center - probably relating to the Landscape Signal - the Music of the Spheres and the Mountain the Mountain of God

And of course the Far God "Cultists" ...... Christians

I still think what we are looking for is the Omphalos Rift .... to be found in the Pavilion of Chaos


Edit : oh ya of course the center of the Area Circumscribed by God being Col 70 FY-N c21-3

Edit Edit: would that make the Guardians the Devil actually? And us being corrupted by their influence (using the guardian technology?) - not sure.... I guess we could be Chaos and Earth be the Pavilion of Chaos...

edit edit edit: What if we are the ancient evil trapped..... that was set free by technology?
