Yeah the 2020 part is strange to me as he has left some forum replys since then, sure he never left Fdev I thought he just stepped down from Elite to work on their "Secret title" but then came back during Odyssey? not as his previous role but maybe regarding lore etc
I can't see any posts by MB after this one, in 2019 https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threa...p-space-commanders.520916/page-6#post-7982454

He could be lurking without any activity getting registered, I guess? The 2020 date is probably just a default date, for those that haven't posted since that date. Older logs may be purged, to clean up a bit.
