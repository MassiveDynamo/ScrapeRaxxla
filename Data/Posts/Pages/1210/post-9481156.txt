I was wondering the same thing. Still painful, but easing a bit. I’ve been using the techniques from

And also the wrist treatments. Clearly the pins and needles are carpal tunnel related. It’s got to be the controllers I’m using. Im also trying these exercises

What’s puzzling me is why it happened-didnt play all that hard (no combat) & not too long for any game sessions for quite a while. Couple of hours a day & I was just running data missions for Fed rank up.

So, is anyone out at Colonia to investigate the Hyford Unstable Data Core mystery?

It supposedly times out today. It must be related to Blackflight, but I have a sneaky suspicion it may also relate to the Sarasvati AI since those logs mention a lost/hidden data archive that was important to anti-Thargoid measures.
