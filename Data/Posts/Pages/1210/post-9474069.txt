Ive only got a crowd of reprobates following me

MB not active since 2020? Just checked against two people who left the game & forum & their last activity was also 2020. Looks like you never actually depart the forum even if you drop out- guess your posts would all disappear if that happened which would cause chaos in the threads.

Edit: wonder if the book he seemingly never wrote, the one that inspired his back tattoo, deals with what we’ll encounter as the Far God?

Yeah the 2020 part is strange to me as he has left some forum replys since then, sure he never left Fdev I thought he just stepped down from Elite to work on their "Secret title" but then came back during Odyssey? not as his previous role but maybe regarding lore etc
