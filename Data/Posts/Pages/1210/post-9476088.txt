MB moved over to the Jurassic game circa 2017/2018, and as far as an open source search can ascertain - he’s still employed by FD and he’s recently had a 7 foot Warhammer sculpture commissioned, so it’s probable that he’s involved within that project at present!

It is possible the forum date parameters are simply not an accurate indication of activity.
