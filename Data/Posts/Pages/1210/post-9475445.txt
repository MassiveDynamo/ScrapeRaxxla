I can't see any posts by MB after this one, in 2019 https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threa...p-space-commanders.520916/page-6#post-7982454

He could be lurking without any activity getting registered, I guess? The 2020 date is probably just a default date, for those that haven't posted since that date. Older logs may be purged, to clean up a bit.
Or, just maybe he got fed up with the lack of story and moved on to pastures new?
I do miss his popping up in the old UA threads and giving us totally unhelpful hints!
At least it showed he cared!
