Hi Modish, long time no see!
And Factubulous has posted that the HIP 22460 permit (Overwatch/Blackflight) is now available.
Updated Permit List
I just remembered the HIP 54530 permit was granted by FD for that one community goal and they said when it was over they would cancel them. Apparently they canceled some and others they didn't. Rocking FDs boat on this might get every ones canceled.

Yep, back in the game after an extended period of post-DW2 burn-out. I also hung up my wings on PS4 and switched permanently to PC.

I'm kind of following along with the Hyford story but I'm on the wrong side of the galaxy to actually go and look at anything.
