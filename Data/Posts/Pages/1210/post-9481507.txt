Hi Modish, long time no see!
And Factubulous has posted that the HIP 22460 permit (Overwatch/Blackflight) is now available.
Updated Permit List
I just remembered the HIP 54530 permit was granted by FD for that one community goal and they said when it was over they would cancel them. Apparently they canceled some and others they didn't. Rocking FDs boat on this might get every ones canceled.
