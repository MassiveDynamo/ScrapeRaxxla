I think you’re right!

Sigh, unfortunately I’m beginning to think my RSI may be a hint that I need to stop playing
I dont think RSI ever truly heals. I still suffer RSI in my right elbow from plastering a bathroom 25 years ago, despite much expensive medical treatment.

And IRL it’s very difficult to do anything without the old opposable thumbs!
Ouch! Makes me wonder if there are some controllers for people with RSI. Seems like a common enough issue
