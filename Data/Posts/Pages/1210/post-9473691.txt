Mmm, I suspect yesterday’s Galnet post is FD giving us a hint about something.

“These include labelling the shadowy figure ‘Salvation’ an AI construct, accusing Utopia of secretly creating a new species of human, and arguing that the universe’s true shape is being concealed by superpower-sponsored holograms”

Ive already said a couple of times that Salvation might be the anti-Thargoid AI from the GCs Sarasvati storyline.

And I suspect the new version of Onionhead is a Trojan Horse. Its description implies it may provide a gateway for other drugs. So, originated either by Thargoids (revenge for Mycoid), Sirius (megolomaniac Club members), or Utopia (megolomaniac dangerous scientists, and Club members). We thought the Thargoids collecting escape pods was a hint that we’d eventually face a threat from genetically-engineered humans, but I suspect the threat originates from Sirius or Utopia.....is this the true Far God? Genetically-engineered super soldiers?

So perhaps a hint where to look to uncover Black Flight & maybe get the Overlook permit??

These articles are often hints of something going on. The conspiracy people usually have the details wrong, but there are still some half-facts in their ideas.
