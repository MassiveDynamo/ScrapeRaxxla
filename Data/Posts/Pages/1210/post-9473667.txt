Mmm, I suspect yesterday’s Galnet post is FD giving us a hint about something.

“These include labelling the shadowy figure ‘Salvation’ an AI construct, accusing Utopia of secretly creating a new species of human, and arguing that the universe’s true shape is being concealed by superpower-sponsored holograms”

Ive already said a couple of times that Salvation might be the anti-Thargoid AI from the GCs Sarasvati storyline.

And I suspect the new version of Onionhead is a Trojan Horse. Its description implies it may provide a gateway for other drugs. So, originated either by Thargoids (revenge for Mycoid), Sirius (megolomaniac Club members), or Utopia (megolomaniac dangerous scientists, and Club members). We thought the Thargoids collecting escape pods was a hint that we’d eventually face a threat from genetically-engineered humans, but I suspect the threat originates from Sirius or Utopia.....is this the true Far God? Genetically-engineered super soldiers?
Edit: or perhaps it’s a means to get pilots hooked on the Pivot performance-enhancing drug from Out of The Darkness?

Edit: and perhaps we need to closely examine those station holograms??

“Years ago, a sinister group called Black Flight committed multiple crimes, including murder, to suppress evidence of Thargoid activity after the First War. The mainstream newsfeeds buried the story, of course. But the fearless truth-seekers among us have repeatedly named the Colonia, Neche and Wasat systems as locations where the Black Flight operated.”

So perhaps a hint where to look to uncover Black Flight & maybe get the Overlook permit??
