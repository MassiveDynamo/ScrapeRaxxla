since raxxla is not known to any powers, much less the dark wheel, it seems that raxxla would not be in a populated system.

It will probably be close to the bubble but it would almost certainly be a non-populated system. Probably not in a scoopable star system (since those tend to get populated). Seems like brown dwarf systems would be the best candidates. Little value to powers, so little interest in extensive exploration, easily passed over by most players since they're not scoopable and tend to be unpopulated.

If raxxla was a megaship of alien origin instead of a planet, and was only described as such after many word of mouth retellings, (and nothing that's been mentioned by fdev would negate it being actually a megaship instead of a planet) then it would be easy to hide raxxla in asteroid belts. Something few if any players take the time to investigate and there are so many of them.

If i wanted to hide something in the game for potentially forever, i'd hide it in an asteroid field around some forgettable dwarf star system for sure.


edit: though if it was a megaship, i guess we'd have had people discover the textures since it seems like it would be unique.

You'd have to explain away this email then.



Imo, TDW is the ancient gen ship missing in time having travelled through the entry to Raxxla. Hence the raison d'etre of their descendents to find Raxxla. Their cloning technology trying to preserve their memories and frequent reminders to remember seems to suggest that they are trying to find their way back.

If the entry to Raxxla is time gated or simply hidden due to the billions of systems, then perhaps finding TDW is indeed the first step which will offer up log evidence that the storyline is a time travel story and further clues to the next step.

Find the TDW gen ship, find Raxxla.
