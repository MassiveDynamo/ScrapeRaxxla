1) Is Raxxla a physical location that is currently accessible in-game?
2) Is Raxxla locked behind a permit? If so is that permit currently obtainable?
3) Has Raxxla been honked by a player but not discovered?
4) why were the Elite/Founder missions at Shinrarta Dehzra dropped from game?
5) Does the Dark Wheel membership test exist in-game?

Any others? Any suggestions for rephrasing welcome
Added to Q1 but other than that I reckon thatâ€™s a solid list of questions.
