Is there a compilation of events pertaining to when Raxxla was first mentioned in ED The Dark Wheel 1984 to present. I’ve read the dark wheel and found it very interesting. I think now after reading this thread, Lave holds a clue. Btw, is Lave 2 still permit locked? Heh, I guess I would look at all of the starter systems at this point. Somewhere between Lave, Sol, and Delphi might be TDW.

LHS 3447 and Asellus Primus (starter systems)
That’s easy. The Codex is the first in-game mention of the word ‘Raxxla’, any of the games (not counting Children of Raxxla player group).
In lore there are a few mentions without any info. The only info in any book, is in The Dark Wheel.
