Strike anyone else as at all odd that the new settlements out in the WH are only a couple jumps away from 46 Eridani, where Salomé started her trip and the message from the engineer out there is that they’re “in need of good pilots and you fit the bill”? And she needs “help with her research” and it’s somehow a funny coincidence that we fit the bill?
