I could explain that email as the most likely option. It is auto generated and planet is the default response for anything not listed in its database.

Though it would not surprise me for fdev to accidentally leak info about a mystery. It's happened before.

No it was quite deliberate because iirc the CMDR put in a request for a hint for Christmas.

Edit 1: Here's the source in this thread https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-6166912

Edit 2: Ah ok nevermind, I get where you are coming from @Darth Ender

Edit 3: If its auto generated then I'm not sure why the word Planet would be only partially italicized. Seems like a human error to me.
