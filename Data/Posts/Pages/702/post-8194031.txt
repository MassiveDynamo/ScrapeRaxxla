Is there a compilation of events pertaining to when Raxxla was first mentioned in ED The Dark Wheel 1984 to present. Iâ€™ve read the dark wheel and found it very interesting. I think now after reading this thread, Lave holds a clue. Btw, is Lave 2 still permit locked? Heh, I guess I would look at all of the starter systems at this point. Somewhere between Lave, Sol, and Delphi might be TDW.

LHS 3447 and Asellus Primus (starter systems)
