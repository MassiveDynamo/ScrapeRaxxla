Imo, TDW is the ancient gen ship missing in time having travelled through the entry to Raxxla. Hence the raison d'etre of their descendents to find Raxxla. Their cloning technology trying to preserve their memories and frequent reminders to remember seems to suggest that they are trying to find their way back.

If the entry to Raxxla is time gated or simply hidden due to the billions of systems, then perhaps finding TDW is indeed the first step which will offer up log evidence that the storyline is a time travel story and further clues to the next step.

Find the TDW gen ship, find Raxxla.

Don't tell Universal Cartographics, they'll hexedit your memory, exploit it for themselves and bring about the world's end! Fight the power, remember Salome! Sacrifice your Arx along the Via Sacra! The Mars artifact is the key for the Arkship. Uhh.. my head is dizzy..
Actually the Generation Ship would seem quite plausible, some people had a dark wheel (meteor shield), and a lapis occultus in the sky, and then a thousand years passes. They startup a business in manufacturing mineral water and drinks. I suppose some colony ships lost their legends on reaching their destinations, some still remember, like in Phekda, and Isinor perhaps.
