I could explain that email as the most likely option. It is auto generated and planet is the default response for anything not listed in its database.

Though it would not surprise me for fdev to accidentally leak info about a mystery. It's happened before.
Don’t think it’s auto generated. I’ve asked frontier questions about Star types etc and never received any response ever. If it were an auto response system I’d imagine it would just spit one out but I’ve never gotten one for any of my questions.
usually auto response systems will also come under “no reply” and from the team not an individual.
