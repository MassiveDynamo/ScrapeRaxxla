4) why were the Elite/Founder missions at Shinrarta Dehzra dropped from game?
They still exist if at least in name only. They also tend to pay double what a similar non-founder/elite mission (had on for 8.5 million, single hop, 180 ton, 178 ls to target Ocellus Starport.) Normal non-F/E missions do not typically pay anything close to that). It might be clearer to mention the missions in question as those involving trinkets and Sap 8 core containers etc.

It might also be good to ask a vague question they might actually address such as if there are unresolved aspects to thargoid/guardian content currently in game etc or in broad terms if the various seemingly irrelevant cargo (sap 8, trinkets, ai relics, ACUs, antiquities etc) actually have a purpose or a purely fluff.

Are the few systems with odd permits like 4 Sextantis, hip 22460 etc are actually obtainable? (they seemed to have been left out when the other unobtainable permits were marked as such.)

Is the dark wheel station currently in game?

Is there an intention to revive/continue lore/story/mystery (UA/UP type) stuff in 2020+ ? (or alternatively why the shift away from that stuff?)

If we expect to get direct answers on any of the Raxxla questions, or to even get the question list directly addressed we are probably dreaming. (remember no clues etc)
