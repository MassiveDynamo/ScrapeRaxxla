Thought I'd try a Google friendly post:

Q: Has anyone tried to get Allied with all Dark Wheel benevolent mission receivers?
A: Yes
Q: Was a Dark Wheel invitation received?
A: No, not yet

In lieu of the questions above, how about:

Q: Has anyone tried to get Allied with all factions in all systems within a 20Ly range of Shinrarta Dezhra?
A: Yes
Q: Was a Dark Wheel invitation received?
A: No, not yet

I see from the latest newsletter that there is to be a livestream (16th?) to celebrate 5 years of the game. DB will almost certainly be involved; now is the time to polish the question set! They need to be short, pointed, and well designed to elicit sensible answers! I rarely do livestreams, besides I already have something booked IRL that day, but I suggest as a starter:
1) Is Raxxla currently accessible in-game?
2) Is Raxxla locked behind a permit? If so is that permit currently obtainable?
3) Has Raxxla been honked by a player but not discovered?
4) why were the Elite/Founder missions at Shinrarta Dehzra dropped from game?
5) Does the Dark Wheel membership test exist in-game?

Any others? Any suggestions for rephrasing welcome
