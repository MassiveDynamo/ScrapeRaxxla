I have x3 of 6A-V1 :/ Do you think SCO will be better on Vette ? Can't test for couple months more yet
Putting the SCO version on my combat Vette was a loss of 0.17LY jump compared to the Pre-engi 6A which i prefer for the 2 second spin up.
Im really only putting the SCO onto explorer's or ships that benefit from the extra jump range whether i actually use the SCO or not.
