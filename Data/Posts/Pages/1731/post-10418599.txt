Kevan is an acquaintance. I may have peer reviewed this paper. I do occasionally peer review for NAWE.

Nice - ya i enjoyed the paper. I was half wondering if the upcoming anthology would contain some analysis like this- but it sounds like it will be a collection of authors writing in the vein of Holdstock. I see you contributed - Looking forward to it!
