Any recommendations for learning more about Paradise Lost/ Milton's work? Or should I just raw dog it and read it as he wrote it? Might help recognize more clues, IDK
I've been using this site as a good source for the original prose, and it has explainer text for unusual words and old cultural references.

There is also the CliffsNotes explainer in plain english for dummies like me. Not a perfect reference point, but it helped me understand the narrative flow and cultural references.
