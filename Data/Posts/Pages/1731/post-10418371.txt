Like any text of its age it has various painterly and abstract concepts which operate on various layers. It has classical; theological; political and scientific elements which are easy to miss.

It is still a matter of discussion how much the text has been utilised in game, and there exists various academic texts with different interpretations, so I’d advise to read these before tackling the work directly.

But in this instance one might best follow the instruction of M Brookes, who recommended via his blog: Paradise Lost: Parallel Prose Edition, Dennis Danielson.

It’s probably safe to assume as Brookes iterated, this was the interpretation he used. It’s a very pragmatic interpretation, it misses certain things, but it’s probably a good starting point.
