I think red dwarfs are m class. Isn't k class yellow?
You're probably right. I'm misremembering. Basically, just hover over the stars, in the map, and uncheck stars until the red dwarfs are filtered out, is what I do. Then check all others, that weren't red dwarfs, to put those ones back on the map.
