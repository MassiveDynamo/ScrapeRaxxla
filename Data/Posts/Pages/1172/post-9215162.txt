It is probably a system that is skipped over, for a reason. The most common star, at least in the game anyway, are red dwarfs. The plotter favors plotting for red dwarfs, over any other kind of star. It is for this reason that I now turn off K-type stars in all plots. Sometimes any refuellable ones all together. This is because, in the case of Guardians, it seems like a lot of these structure sites are in Tauri, or Proto star systems. It could be that whatever we're looking for is in an ugly old brown dwarf system. Sometimes, when passing through some of the heavily explored areas, like Synuefe, I find unexplored tauri and brown dwarf systems. Nobody wants them.
I think red dwarfs are m class. Isn't k class yellow?
