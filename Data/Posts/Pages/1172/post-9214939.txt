If there's a charity Frontier supports maybe we could convince them to set a goal for us to reach in exchange for a Galnet piece on Raxxla that might help. Just a thought, it's kinda like getting a hint - but in a way that doesn't feel like it's cheating.

As long as theres no actual hint or clue just fluff & more lore Im up for that, they used to support Movember (Cancer Research) a fair bit but dunno if they did last year, theyve also done a fair bit for gamers with disabilities getting special adapted controllers and a few individual cases but they were more in-game and in-person than a Charity drive as such. Its more promo stuff than direct support.

A game I play is full of Water Aid donations (giving fresh water access / digging wells for villages across Africa and other countries).
