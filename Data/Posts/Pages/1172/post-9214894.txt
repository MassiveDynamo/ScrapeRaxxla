If we've been to the system before it's accessible, it's just us realizing there's a system with more that meets the eye which seems impossible but I imagine over time Frontier will give more hints to help us at least narrow down the systems to search.

If there's a charity Frontier supports maybe we could convince them to set a goal for us to reach in exchange for a Galnet piece on Raxxla that might help. Just a thought, it's kinda like getting a hint - but in a way that doesn't feel like it's cheating.
