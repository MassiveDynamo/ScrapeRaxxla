Sensitive much folks? It was a joke refering to the state of the Odyssey release, not console owners

That's exactly what my post was as well but there are hateful PM messages from both sides now

Not sure what I've got myself into

I'm on PC, I'm beta testing for Consoles (could say Consoholes but man, THAT would be a trigger). That what the joke was about. If someone needs to dislocate the broom from their rectum let me know, I'll get the plyers.
