Sorry. It's very sensitive as frontier actively stated they don't care about the open insulting of console players even though it clearly violates both forum terms and game terms. I have an email pretty much saying that if the mods don't care neither do they

I could have sworn Id seen a statement or something about the specific phrase 'Console P...' that I know you dislike and offends you but can't find it now. But these are from the Code of Conduct:

Frontier Code of Conduct

>HARASSMENT
We do not tolerate harassment within our community or our games. This is defined as being insulting to any person via obscene, offensive, hateful or inflammatory comments. This also includes the prolonged, extensive, and/or malicious targeting of an individual or group of individuals through Frontier-owned platforms for the purposes of disruption or agitation.

DISCRIMINATION & LANGUAGE
Do not discriminate against others. Being abusive, or promoting abuse, towards other players based on race, ethnicity, nationality, sex or gender, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability or other criteria that offends other users will not be tolerated

Emphasis added but that should cover it shouldn't it?
