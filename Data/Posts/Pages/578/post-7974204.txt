So: Tinfoil time...

During lunch I was under the vague impression "Parents grief/Lovers woe" might be connected to the Ilias with Priamos being the parent and the lovers Paris and Helena. So I decided to look on Galmap whether I might find a system named "Troy" - no result. But when I entered the German word for Troy (Troja) the marker inexplicably jumped to Eta Cassiopeiae. The incident was repeatable so I'm unsure whether it's a bug or not.

Third planet in Eta Cass is named 'Trojan'.
