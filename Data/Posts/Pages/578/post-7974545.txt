This got me thinking. Did we really avoid Y2K? Did it just subtly go by causing problems we missed? Did it cause the events leading to the thargoids? Are there any references to this now forgotten event and scare in modern history?! Is this a universe if Y2K happened, the friends special was never watched, 9/11 never happened and we found the government secrets, and the universe slowly plunged into chaos?

On another note. I believe that is called an Amish paradise.

I wonder if they have every tried to release trojan ham?! They could go into a new form of sausage making and meat brining business. And make godawful commercials about pounding your meat and sticking in their lovely casings sealed in juices and sat for a month in their commercial grade cellars. TROJAN HAM!!!
