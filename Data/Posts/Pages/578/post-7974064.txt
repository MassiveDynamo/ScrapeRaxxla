So: Tinfoil time...

During lunch I was under the vague impression "Parents grief/Lovers woe" might be connected to the Ilias with Priamos being the parent and the lovers Paris and Helena. So I decided to look on Galmap whether I might find a system named "Troy" - no result. But when I entered the German word for Troy (Troja) the marker inexplicably jumped to Eta Cassiopeiae. The incident was repeatable so I'm unsure whether it's a bug or not.

While I was on it I thought whether Atlantis, El Dorado und John Presbyter might actually be hints. Atlantis of course is easy to find (for reasons unknown it's underlayed with a green treiangle on my Galmap - Any idea what that means?) El Dorado on the other hand could not be found under the spanish name, but looking for its indigenious name Omagua I found a system going by that name so I think it's safe to say both Atlantis and El Dorado are in the game. Concerning John Presbyter I have currently no idea what to look for.
