So: Tinfoil time...


While I was on it I thought whether Atlantis, El Dorado und John Presbyter might actually be hints. Atlantis of course is easy to find (for reasons unknown it's underlayed with a green treiangle on my Galmap - Any idea what that means?) El Dorado on the other hand could not be found under the spanish name, but looking for its indigenious name Omagua I found a system going by that name so I think it's safe to say both Atlantis and El Dorado are in the game. Concerning John Presbyter I have currently no idea what to look for.

Further than I got with this so nice one I did wonder the same, I'm British and have never heard of the John fella so was wondering if that was a clue, the other 2 are very well known as are others that could be used instead but then I read too much into anything sometimes...3 systems by definition would form a triangle with a mid-point (or maybe 4 if you read above, its over my head)
