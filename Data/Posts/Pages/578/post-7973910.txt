I might have said the same a few months back, but it seems FD have been gradually walking away from that position, and the Gan Romero admission that Galnet is just fluff helps to confirm that. All the posturing, intrigue and murder in the story have been reduced to a bit of background noise, whilst new bigger guns and ships are now the emphasis. The interstellar initiatives seem just to be to enable them to set up the next round of combat oriented narrative - equipping us with more toys to fight with.

In an internal fantasy world, I look for a dev to chime in and tell us to keep our hopes up, but it won't happen, I'm sure (now doing the equivalent of standing on a hill in a thunderstorm waving a long sword shouting 'all gods are bar-star'ds' - [ref to T. Pratchett] )
Yes. People have been talking about how the second initiative was better, because of the good story!?!?
Hi CMDRs, please go and **** off the thargoids so we can have a big battle. The end. Maybe I expect to much, but where exactly was the good story?

Edit - Having the 1st round as go hand in exploration data, that will keep the explorers happy didn't quite cut it for me.

Again....maybe my expectations are unrealistic.

Edit 2 - what would have made it more interesting is if you had a pacifist faction you could donate the exploration data too, who would have blocked aegis. Then, at least, player actions would have GENUINELY influenced the path of the initiative. As it was, what was going to happen was going to happen. Any suggestion that commanders influenced it is lip service
