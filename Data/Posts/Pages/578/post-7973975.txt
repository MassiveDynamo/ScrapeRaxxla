Thanks Han_Zen....hmm still doesn't rule out Fdev player, just means nothing super suspicious about it, unlike the planet mapped by Salome, after she died.

To quote Victor Meldrew, I don't believe it! I've just searched EDDB for any station near Shapley 1, no filters, and the first one in the list is...a massive coincidence. Have a look Yelboc, it may be as close as we get, I'm on the way now
