And I've played 30 years of games from Asteroids & Planetoid, through Starlancer and the X Universe and always thought....well it's good but it's not Elite...so yes I am biased (addicted for life, pretty much regardless of what happens, if it all gets too bad I can retreat into Solo)

I've also learned to laugh at the non-existence of Raxxla in any previous game, preferring to see it as a magic trick rather than a con / insult....he's got me again.
