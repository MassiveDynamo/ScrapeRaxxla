oops...it was Psyren Farseer with a y not an i as I posted, still not an Xbox player though, system was right in earlier post.

OK so Galfluff was just stories of 'space madness' rather than evidence or meaningful, but they never said it was, or wasn't I accept

Psyren Farseer is a PC player. At least the name shows up when I search in game.
