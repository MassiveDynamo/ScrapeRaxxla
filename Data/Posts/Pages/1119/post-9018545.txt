I seem to remember a map in a SAP8 was the objective of one of the now deleted SD TDW missions. Could be FD decided to retcon that whole mechanism to find Raxxla......
If, indeed, it wasnâ€™t obfuscation in the first place, since TDW in SD are supposed to be a front clearly they could not have been trusted with the secret to finding Raxxla!
Obfuscated in the Outer Rim: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/#post-2571931 Two of the other missions also involved SAP-8 and decrypting their contents, while the fourth was Trinkets of Hidden Fortune.
