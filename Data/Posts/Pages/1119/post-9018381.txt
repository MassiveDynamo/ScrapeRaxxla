Ok so brief update, after seeing it mentioned about the Alpha Backer names, It seems they where changed to the correct player names, I know for definite I was not ever out around this area since after Gamma and the system has my name and not Alpha Backer #9

So either Alpha Backer #2 created a new account or somethings fishy although its very possible they also kept the Alpha backer name
