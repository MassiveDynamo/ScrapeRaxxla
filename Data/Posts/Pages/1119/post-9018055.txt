IRL it is actually 19h 58m 45.39s. But who is counting? Maybe by 3300 it has leaned over a couple more minutes.
If it was a true 3300 position, it would probably have moved a lot more. It's a high propper motion star and moved more than two minutes, from 1950 to 2000.

I think all the catalogue stars are inserted by converting their Galactic coordinates and estimated distance to X, Y, Z in ED. This will give a slight offset on the RA and Dec, compared to RL.
