That's basically the way ED works. Mechanics are drip fed, as the game evolves. It's not unlikely that the Guardian ruins at some point, will give more info to decode. If we are luck, we get some when we can walk up to them.

I strongly suspect that Raxxla is in the game, but the map is not. I think it's the same with the Dark Wheel. The station is probably somewhere, but there is no way to get invited.

A wild tinfoil idea and dumb luck with picking and interpreting the right hints are probably our best shot for now.
I seem to remember a map in a SAP8 was the objective of one of the now deleted SD TDW missions. Could be FD decided to retcon that whole mechanism to find Raxxla......
If, indeed, it wasnâ€™t obfuscation in the first place, since TDW in SD are supposed to be a front clearly they could not have been trusted with the secret to finding Raxxla!
