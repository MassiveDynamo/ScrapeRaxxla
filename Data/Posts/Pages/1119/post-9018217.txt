I still think the mission texts were mostly foreshadowing the Guardian stuff. After the ruins were found, they were kind of obsolete. They were just not replaced with any interesting new missions.
You could be right. I think the point was that the data crystals (which sounded like Guardian tech) held relevant information (quite likely on Raxxla, a map). However we’ve never found a mechanism to get info out of any of that tech. I still suspect the triangular obelisk patterns, but that was also tried, and failed, by better decryption minds than mine. My only contribution was that perhaps they’re similar to Braille.
