The Crystal Record , also known as the book of Chaak, discovered on the long dead world of Marangora II .....is a logging , as if by a crewman on board a patrol vessel, of the history,myths and explorations of the Tholmathon at the height of their power...Tholmathon had visited Earth during the Permian.... is an account of the expedition to contact the last colonists on earth, called the Lajial;..."fugitives from the dying Sand World, themselves destined to extinction in the sterile cities that nestled among the violent life on the third world... No trace of those Martians, for surely the Crystal Record refers to creatures from that dead world... The Alien World

So clearly the Martian Artifact was a data crystal left by a Tholmathon crewman on Mars. The remaining Tholmathon moved to earth and devolved becoming Humans.....
