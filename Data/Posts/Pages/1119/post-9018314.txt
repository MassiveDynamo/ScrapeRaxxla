You could be right. I think the point was that the data crystals (which sounded like Guardian tech) held relevant information (quite likely on Raxxla, a map). However we’ve never found a mechanism to get info out of any of that tech. I still suspect the triangular obelisk patterns, but that was also tried, and failed, by better decryption minds than mine. My only contribution was that perhaps they’re similar to Braille.
That's basically the way ED works. Mechanics are drip fed, as the game evolves. It's not unlikely that the Guardian ruins at some point, will give more info to decode. If we are luck, we get some when we can walk up to them.

I strongly suspect that Raxxla is in the game, but the map is not. I think it's the same with the Dark Wheel. The station is probably somewhere, but there is no way to get invited.

A wild tinfoil idea and dumb luck with picking and interpreting the right hints are probably our best shot for now.
