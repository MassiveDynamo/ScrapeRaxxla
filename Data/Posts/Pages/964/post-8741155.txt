Aight, i'll try to do my worst. Any advice aside from accepting and then dropping missions? Possibly without getting notoriety

Edit: changed my mind. I don't really care about notoriety, it might be fun. Any advice? Should i do this in Shinrarta or is there a system which is more prone to Raxxla extravaganza? As I said, i don't know much but i'd like to help

Think I would do it in a low security system, see https://eddb.io/faction/41917 for less stress.
