So, i'm officially hostile to the Dark Wheel. For now, i didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. I just accepted and abandoned missions as Tibercov suggested. I was dumb enough to do so in a station which instantly blew up my poor krait once i became hostile. Never been hostile to a faction, so this was new to me lol. Anyway, the rank message looked normal.
The only "odd" thing is that since Jameson Memorial is always controlled by the Pilots' Federation, i can still dock there without any problem and even accept missions from the Dark Wheel.
Again, since I've never been hostile to a faction i'll leave here a screenshot of the message, idk if there is anything suspicious but i highly doubt so.

I'll keep my eyes open to see if any weird stuff pops up. i'll also try to kill some dark wheel people, maybe it will trigger something. Any more advice?
