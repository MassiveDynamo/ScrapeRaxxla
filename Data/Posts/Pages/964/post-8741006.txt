Hi everyone, I'm new to the forum and this raxxla stuff, but from what I understand the Dark Wheel and Raxxla are closely tied, and getting allied with the faction results in "strange stuff" happening. Now, I was thinking, has anyone tried to get them hostile to see if something happens?

Again, I'm kinda new here so sorry if this is OT
