Just going for a wild goose hunt and need some assistance...
If I arrive at a specific system in the bubble and want to go "right" or "east"... which system/star should I target.

This is an honest and genuine question. Thanks in advance for any information you guys may provide.
Cheers!
Good question, as you're asking for directions based on an object that spins on it's axis every 24 hours

North is somewhere in the vicinity of Polaris, but that also changes over time due to axial tilt. For East / West you could use the fixed "Royal" stars on the ecliptic: Aldebaran, Regulus, Antares and Fomalhaut in Aquarius but again, they appear to move if you're on Earth looking at Sol in front of them through the year.

Our ecliptic plane is tilted in relation to the galactic too, the East / West plane above is on quite an angle.
