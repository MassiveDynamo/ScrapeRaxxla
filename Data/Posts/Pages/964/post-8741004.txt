It’s not over until it’s over gentlemen and even then there may be more work to be done.
I truly believe that Galnet has more answers within it than we’ve been lead to believe.

For example: Remember the Onionhead stories? They came out right after the game launched when we had no clue or confirmation about what happened to the Thargoids. The story beats for that plant were silly at the time but looking back at it the story alluded to the “What happened to the aliens” before we were actually told by FDEV.
-Onionhead discovered and met with much suspicion and outlawed
-Admiral Vincent commences hostility and bombards them with no response
-Admiral Vincent deploys a specifically designed weapon that only targets Onionhead and wipes it out.
-Admiral Vincent was found to be acting unilaterally and received criticism
-A new strain of Onionhead emerges genetically engineered to be resistant to the weapon used against it previously.

Now replace the word Onionhead with Thargoid and the words Admiral Vincent with INRA and read that again.

This isn’t a bombshell or smoking gun but back when these articles came out FDEV was tight lipped about Thargoids and what happened to them. We had no clue. They used “space pot” as an analogy and it’s hard to notice when at the time, these articles weren’t complete and instead came out one by one of the course of a few weeks.

Ultimately all I’m saying is, Galnet does appear to have some hidden gems within it, in articles you wouldn’t expect. They just require you to actually READ them and have some knowledge of the lore while also keeping in mind Galnet is biased and probably controlled by The Club.

Don’t give up Commanders. If we need a further 10,000 pages, so be it.
