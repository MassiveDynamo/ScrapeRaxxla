What if we search for planetary nebula? If you read how others cmdr describe them, that will match to what federal president said before disappear.
Also just linked article couple posts above, those nebulas may look as spiral star. And we need at least double star system to create spirals, or dwarf + big giant.
Only 1 issue ...they don't last for long. Usually couple thousands years.
