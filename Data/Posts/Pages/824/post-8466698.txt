Parsec is a functional unit a bit like an Inch (which is the length of the thumb from knuckle to hand roughly, and a handy size for timber work), a bit like imperial versus the SI unit based LY, although a year is also rather functional.

It comes from measuring things by parallax from Earth. 1 Parsec is the distance a star would be, if it shifted +/- 1 arc second in the sky between one side and the other of the earths orbit - hence par-sec or parallax-second.

Unfortunately, it was coined and popularised (1838) before we realised that the speed of light is constant (1884), so astronomers still use this rather earth-centric unit. LY makes much more sense if you believe in the fixed speed of light in the universe.
