Parsec is a functional unit a bit like an Inch (which is the length of the thumb from knuckle to hand roughly, and a handy size for timber work), a bit like imperial versus the SI unit based LY, although a year is also rather functional.

It comes from measuring things by parallax from Earth. 1 Parsec is the distance a star would be, if it shifted +/- 1 arc second in the sky between one side and the other of the earths orbit - hence par-sec or parallax-second.

Unfortunately, it was coined and popularised (1838) before we realised that the speed of light is constant (1884), so astronomers still use this rather earth-centric unit. LY makes much more sense if you believe in the fixed speed of light in the universe.

Thanks, didn't know that history. Was always wondered why they don't use LY wider.
