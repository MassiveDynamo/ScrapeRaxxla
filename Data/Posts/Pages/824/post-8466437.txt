I saw yesterday some circle on FSS! Later I figured it was rings, planet was less then 100ls to arriving point. So once you open FSS it shows unusual objects there (rings) immediately.
On example of FC we can see that persistent objects may trip between stars. So planet should be something like FC, but with orbit Eccentricity > 1
