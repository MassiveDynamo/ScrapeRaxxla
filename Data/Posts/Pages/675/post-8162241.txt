Not to try to high jack the thread or say im trolling etc, but from the very start of the game, the quest for raxxla is a folk tail, a wild goose chase per say, if you really look from where it originated from. It is not real nor will ever be found because it just doesn't exist at all. The quest to find raxxla was a treasure hunt from the start to get you to just waste your time and create some type of reason to look. I am not trying to high jack your thread nor troll before any of the mods get ban happy. It is just my 2 cents as i have been playing the game for over 3 years. All this time wasted for this so called quest is just a waste of time and never existed from the get go.
