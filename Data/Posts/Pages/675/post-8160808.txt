OK, so as soon as I scanned Eden I got the convoy under attack, but not sure if I'm supposed to assist the convoy or join the attackers. When you get the info up on a target it shows:
Wanted
then a faction.

Is that faction the faction they belong to , or the faction that has imposed the bounty on them??? (You can see I don't do combat very often!)
