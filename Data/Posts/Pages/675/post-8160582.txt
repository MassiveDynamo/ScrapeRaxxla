Something crazy. What if DW station placed in the L3 of system Alpha Centauri A+B and Proxima?.. Another voyage for another 2 hours.

I did check all 5 lagrange points of Eden-Proxima but found nothing. Doesn’t mean it’s not worth checking again, it’s difficult to get accurate positioning on them & it may be that you have to be quite close for the station to instance. I’m out at Hutton Orbital again, will have another look see, and another go at those darned annacondas if I find them...didn’t think of A/B-Proxima L points, and with these bodies I suspect it would be around an hour per Lpoint! Also difficult to find the points since the A/B centre of gravity is not measurable by ship instruments. Also it would be unlikely as the codex pic clearly shows a planet reasonably close.

Is it possible to follow a high wake into a permit-locked system without having the permit??? Wondering if I need to follow the wake of the npcs that appeared at L2; got a FSWS fitted now.
