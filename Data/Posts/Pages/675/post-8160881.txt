At least say when it is in the strem
watching it while checking out lagrange points. Drew Wagar has Cmdr Plater doing a supposed test for TDW set by Alessia Verdi, involving trip to Tionisla graveyard tourist beacon, then Achenar, then ...only as far as I've got. Trail starts around 7 mins in. Suspect it is not representative of the DW test that FD will have set- DW has said frequently he knows nothing of Raxxla, not sure how much he knows of TDW
