OK, have investigated Proxima-Eden L2 again, got (wanted) Hutton Orbital ships (python + two annies?) attacking a convoy from some other faction). Eden blots out Proxima, so doesn't represent the codex pic. I've travelled out 5.54ls from Proxima to get that visual relationship of Eden against Proxima to correspond to the pic. Sat waiting.... no station here: I expect three will turn up together eventually!
