So in regards to far supercruise trips. This is an idea I had a while back that I'd wished to have worked on but didn't.
In the Dark Wheel novella Jason Ryder's ship was the Nemesis. IRL, there's a hypothetical second sun, a small brown dwarf, in Sol. It should be roughly 5hrs away in Elite Speed, maybe further. This second sun is named Nemesis because it's believed to cause catastrophe and extinctions when it nears Earth in it's orbital path.
Now, irl, this is unlikely, but given the name, it makes me wonder. We have the Nemesis ELW being orbited by the HMC Pandora in Momus Reach
Now, IRL in 2019 there's also another hypothesized planet, a 9th planet, just like Nemesis. The Elite 9th planet discovered in Elite's Sol is Persephone and she's been a frequent character.
The 9th planet being there could indicate that Nemesis is too. Maybe the FSS cant see the distance, or it's undetectable. I really wish I'd had tried this personally.
The longest supercruise to a body in game is Dabih Major in the Capricorn constellation at a roughly 3hr supercruise and the FSS works for it, but no stations, and just ice moons.
Nemesis seems suspect to me.
