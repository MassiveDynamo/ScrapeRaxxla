For people interested in the Holdstock angle... Here are some snippets (poorly photographed from my cell phone) from the book "Tour of the Universe" co-written by Edwards and Holdstock. Specifically focusing on the Alien Ruins on Pluto and the "Dead World Scroll" - I know we've talked about the Tour before ... but I didn't remember anyone sharing or talking about the stuff from Pluto so I thought Id put them here ...

SPOILER: FROM THE OFFICIAL GUIDE TO THE RUINS OF PLUTO

SPOILER: DEAD WORLD SCROLL

SPOILER: TRANSLATION AND NOTES


I will just suggest you read the Dark Wheel Toast and then read the translation of the Dead World Scroll...

Make what you will of it
