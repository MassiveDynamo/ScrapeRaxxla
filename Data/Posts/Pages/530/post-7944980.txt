Sorry, but I spent months exploring The Rift, as I was sure that this mysterious region where so many ships had disappeared for so many years, as it has always been told in every station bar across the known space, was hosting Raxxla. That "great" mYsTeRy and the "there be ghosts" -thing turned out to be a very human stranded ship. Only ghosts there are those of its very human dead crew.
First of my many disappointments with FD story lines...
