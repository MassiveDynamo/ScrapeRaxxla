Iirc, there also was a log in Conflux or Hawking's about some crew going crazy after they passed near some weird planet.
Could have been a way for FD to link in some way the Rift mYsTeRy with Raxxla Quest...
Its possible. I'm going to hop in the Audet Somniare and go spend a good long time sniffing around the rift. Worst case? A whole heap of scan credit waiting for me when I get home
If anybody fancies joining me for some brute force scan shenanigans, your more than welcome.
Edit:
Apparently we are lokoing for a planet with 5 big pillars at each pole! ;-)
I'll be starting at the Children of Raxxla tourist beacon in Eafots BP-I d9-35 I think
