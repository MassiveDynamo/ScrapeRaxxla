They forgot all about the Rift for over two years. It was only the fact that people started roleplaying their own storyline that caused FDev to make it official again. So no, that's not the case.
With all respect, I may sometimes forget, but I always try to add "...in my opinion", or "I think/don't think" to this type of statement. Given that we know nothing, I don't think we can/should state anything as fact.
