With all respect, I may sometimes forget, but I always try to add "...in my opinion", or "I think/don't think" to this type of statement. Given that we know nothing, I don't think we can/should state anything as fact.
and by the same respects we shouldn't vehemently argue against anything/everything also.

I can't explain why they might have put it somewhere near the same place as some other mystery. however that doesn't mean they didn't and it shouldn't be so hardcore argued against if it isn't known factually. All that does is limit The avenues of exploration we have to find it.no one's forcing you to go search the formidine rift for it if you're not interested in it you don't have to but like why are you so extremely against it even being considered by others?Obfuscation?
