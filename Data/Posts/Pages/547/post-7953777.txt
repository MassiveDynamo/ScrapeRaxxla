About "mother of galaxies", just to remind to our English speakers excellent fellow-threaders that in some other localisation of the game, the wording would be translated as "mother of all the galaxies". Can Cassiopea be called this ? Or shall we remind the many times proven inconsistencies in FD translations, astronomy and story unfolding and say: "meh.. same thing..." ?
( Some other subtle differences in the other verses too. Keywords: корона , cima, etc..)

From a science and language point of view:
Mother of all galaxies would be either “gravity” or “big bang”
Mother of galaxies (of which Milky way is one) could be Sagittarius A*, since Milky Way also has satellite galaxies, or again could be gravity, or big bang.
Mother of Milky Way could be Sag A*, gravity, big bang, Gaia or other mythological goddesses.

Don’t see how this helps
Need more breakfast coffee!
