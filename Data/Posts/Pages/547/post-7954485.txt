If TDW don't know where Raxxla is (which old lore suggests, but isn't confirmed by the Codex) then the toast can't provide directions.
If TDW do know where Raxxla is, then they'd be bloody stupid to give directions to it in the toast and run the risk of a non-TDW commander finding it.
Hypothetically speaking if someone in the dark wheel, possibly Ryder at one point in time in the past, did have a 'map to raxxla' in a certain sense. Perhaps that person dies before anyone else ever sees the alleged 'map.'

now perhaps years later someone else in the dark wheel going through that person's belongings finds the alleged 'map' but doesn't realize what it is, other than at face value.

Now imagine the 'map' is more of directions in the form of a riddle, that way if found, wouldn't provide straightforward directions. Suppose it says..

"To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies! To the whisperer in witchspace, the siren of the deepest void! The parent's grief, the lover's woe, and the yearning of our vagabond hearts. To Raxxla!"

But it really intends more of a...

(Go)To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies! (Then take) the whisperer in witchspace (fsd jump?), (to) the siren of the deepest void!(I have nothing for this part) The parent's grief, the lover's woe, and the yearning of our vagabond hearts. (this is how you get) To Raxxla!
