If this has been noticed then apologies but I have an observation that may add grounds to the "Raxxla is a doorway/gateway to another place".

Somewhere in this thread mention of another galaxy was made that could be hidden dormant on another server. Well, has anyone noticed the two superclusters of stars in the Galactic map that is outside of the galaxy ( Eastside, below the galactic plane )? They are not part of a background skybox as they do move as you pan around the map and they are huge! Perhaps our next destination is right in front of our eyes... it's just getting there.

Funny that you mention this I wanted to re-translate the first part of the toast but wasn't sure if it fits

To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies.

Which can also translates using nautical terms as

To the Moving Bridge/Gangway/Passage (brow is nautical for a moving bridge from ship to shore and vice versa)

and the brow must be laid at the edge of something which in this case the Mother of Galaxies. Which I believe The Dark Wheel refers the Milky Way as their Mother of Galaxies.
