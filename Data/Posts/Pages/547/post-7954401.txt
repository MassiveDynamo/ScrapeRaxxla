eta Cygni is close to the centre of your last plot but there's nothing on it in EDSM (I checked a handful of alternative names and since it's in the Hipparcos catalogue and the bright star catalogue, i.e. has HIP and HR designations, I would expect it to be in-game).
As I have mentioned before, I wonder whether TDW toast and Astrophil mention are intended to direct us to a system or a heading to take within a system. Unless you guess the system, though, or get TDW invite and hear it from them (if they know), then its going to be through looking at the problem in the right way that leads to the breakthrough. Given how long the game has been going without it being stumbled upon, I'm not expecting blind luck to get us far with either Raxxla or TDW base. Depending on proximity, I might be able to get in-game and check eta Cygni later today, or at least see if it's there.

If TDW don't know where Raxxla is (which old lore suggests, but isn't confirmed by the Codex) then the toast can't provide directions.
If TDW do know where Raxxla is, then they'd be bloody stupid to give directions to it in the toast and run the risk of a non-TDW commander finding it.
