About "mother of galaxies", just to remind to our English speakers excellent fellow-threaders that in some other localisation of the game, the wording would be translated as "mother of all the galaxies". Can Cassiopea be called this ? Or shall we remind the many times proven inconsistencies in FD translations, astronomy and story unfolding and say: "meh.. same thing..." ?
( Some other subtle differences in the other verses too. Keywords: корона , cima, etc..)

I would not completely discount Cassiopeia. The toast could be poorly written by drunk Dark Wheelers (FD).

I have very little faith in the Cassiopeia though. There is no Omphalos candidates in that direction. The wording would be incredibly clumsy, if it was Cass. If worded properly, it would be far to obvious (not a little bit) for a Raxla hint.

I'm not gonna spend any time on Cassiopeia, but I'm happy that others do. In case I'm wrong.
