eta Cygni is close to the centre of your last plot but there's nothing on it in EDSM (I checked a handful of alternative names and since it's in the Hipparcos catalogue and the bright star catalogue, i.e. has HIP and HR designations, I would expect it to be in-game).
As I have mentioned before, I wonder whether TDW toast and Astrophil mention are intended to direct us to a system or a heading to take within a system. Unless you guess the system, though, or get TDW invite and hear it from them (if they know), then its going to be through looking at the problem in the right way that leads to the breakthrough. Given how long the game has been going without it being stumbled upon, I'm not expecting blind luck to get us far with either Raxxla or TDW base. Depending on proximity, I might be able to get in-game and check eta Cygni later today, or at least see if it's there.
It's called 21 Eta Cygni in ED. It's not far out and well explored.

There are a bunch of RL stars in that region. I'm currently in HD 227018. It has a nice big black hole and all. I doubt I find anything.
