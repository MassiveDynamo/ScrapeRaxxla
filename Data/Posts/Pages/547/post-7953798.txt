From a science and language point of view:
Mother of all galaxies would be either “gravity” or “big bang”
Mother of galaxies (of which Milky way is one) could be Sagittarius A*, since Milky Way also has satellite galaxies, or again could be gravity, or big bang.
Mother of Milky Way could be Sag A*, gravity, big bang, Gaia or other mythological goddesses.

Don’t see how this helps
Need more breakfast coffee!

Gravity, Big bang, dust, energy, dark matter. Lots of diffuse options in science. In reality, the reasons for galaxy formations are complex. To an extent it's beyond current science.

In mythology there are plenty of creation stories that are linked to the night sky. Many of them talk of a world egg or similar.

The toast is made by The Dark Wheel. When they talk of galaxies, it could well be the old 8 galaxies from Elite.
