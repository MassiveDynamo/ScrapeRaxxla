An Akousmata (words of wisdom) of Pythagoras: “ Question: What is the oracle of Delphi?
Answer: The tetraktys, or the harmony where the Sirens dwell.” from Iamblichus' (a neoplatonist)- 'Life of Pythagoras'.

Plato describes a series of 8 planets circling the Spindle of Necessity "and up above on each of the rims of the circles a Siren stood, borne around in its revolution and uttering one sound, one note, and from all the eight there was the concord of a single harmony" (music of the spheres). From 'the Myth of Er'.

SPOILER: SPINDLE OF NECESSITY


Based on Platos descriptions ... the eighth planet would be the Moon.
