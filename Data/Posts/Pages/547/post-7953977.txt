I've been expanding a bit on the RA 20 LA. As I suspect that 'Princess Astrophel' refers to Vega / the weaver girl, I wondered if 'LA' could be Lyra and Aquila?
The bridge between Vega (Lyra) and Altair (Aquila) in the story of the cow heard and the weaver girl, is known as the magpie bridge (anyone remember the mineral magpie? ).

Magpie bridge:

Overlaying this with a map of the Cygnus constellation gives this (RA 20h highlighted):

As we see, there is a common strip, between about Dec. 33째 and Dec. 40째. Center is around Dec. 35째.

For fun I also overlaid the Raxxla symbol:
SPOILER

As we see the symbol fits reasonably well with the bridge and RA 20h line. The horizontal path of the symbol does not match up with the equatorial parallels or the galactic plane. It would probably align well with a line parallel to the ecliptic (earth's orbit around the sun), but quite a bit above.

Tinfoil:

The Raxxla symbol is a stylized version of the Mars relic. A navigation tool to get to Raxxla. The 33 dots gives the declination. Tilted parallel to the ecliptic and lifted to Dec. 33째, it will show the way.
