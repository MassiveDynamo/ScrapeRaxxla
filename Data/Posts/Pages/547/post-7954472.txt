Not sure that makes sense, since the toast is 'To Raxxla'.
Also, you presumably only learn the toast when you're inducted, at which point you should know the location of the station. On top of which, it's only allegedly the toast.

I guess what I'm really saying is...

It's not a clue
I would argue that since it is publicly out there... The dark wheel wants it to be... Since raxxla is the raison d'etre of the dark wheel... What else would they be toasting. And since it out there publicly whether they knew where raxxla is or not they would not be giving clues for raxxla out. But they are looking for skilled recruits so they put a test in the toast... A " path of enlightenment" if you will. That leads the initiate to the next stage... The dark wheel station... But ya could mean nothing too
