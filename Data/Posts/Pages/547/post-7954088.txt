If this has been noticed then apologies but I have an observation that may add grounds to the "Raxxla is a doorway/gateway to another place".

Somewhere in this thread mention of another galaxy was made that could be hidden dormant on another server. Well, has anyone noticed the two superclusters of stars in the Galactic map that is outside of the galaxy ( Eastside, below the galactic plane )? They are not part of a background skybox as they do move as you pan around the map and they are huge! Perhaps our next destination is right in front of our eyes... it's just getting there.

Those are the large and small Magellanic clouds. Dwarf galaxies close to the Milky Way. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magellanic_Clouds

They can technically be considered part of the MW, so It wouldn't be impossible that they are 'active'. Even though FD have stated that there are no plans for other galaxies.

HD 2270 seems like a nice jump of point, both to them and Andromeda.
