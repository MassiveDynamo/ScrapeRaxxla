Have you guys heard about the weird stuff going on with searching for Sabiyhan in the system map?
I read the guy's post on a site (not reddit) who found the bug and I'm not comfortable with what he's trying to do...

I also note other posts have been deleted as they referenced something that breaks the ToS around this subject.

I will say from what I read and other things he quoted in his post, I don't think this is relevant to this hunt and from the other examples he quoted it looks like hard coded systems that have been added when something has happened in game. I would suggest it's a location that was a left over from a story line that wasn't played out in game (or at least I hope so).

However, based on the help he was seeking it is clear in my opinion that he is trying to find the answer to Raxxla by undeniably cheating.
