Kind of like if we put a specific federal system under imperial or alliance control or even one of the various independents. Or even liberated control from various fed/alliance/imperial systems into independent control, subjectively* freeing systems. This could potentially have hidden and undiscovered rewards such as a system permit. Also I've been wondering what if we wrested control in a system that is permit locked to an opposing side. Ie what if we put a system like Vega which requires federal rank to unlock in the hands of the empire. Or the same but reversed with a system like Summerland. Both of these systems seem useless and unnecessary for a permit locked to be on them but maybe that is a form of obfuscation itself

*I say subjectively because it's easy for everyone to have their own idea of what a free system might be
That has already happened: Ross 128, an important Federal maximum security prison, was taken over by the Alliance years ago, and FDev patched the game so it couldn't happen again.
