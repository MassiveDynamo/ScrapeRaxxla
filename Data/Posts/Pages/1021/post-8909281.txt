I want to correct you a little, in 2296 Raxxla is already a legend. They do not become legends in a couple of years, which means at least they were passed down by one generation. We need to look for systems in the first wave of space exploration, and there are fewer systems.
Then pass Achenar, it was colonized in 2291. Others had 134 years +/-.
