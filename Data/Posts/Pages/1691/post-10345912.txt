Yes. My understanding is based upon the path of Jacques and the establishment of the theory that the base of Chaos and his ‘throne’ denotes the lowest point of the zone of chaos.

I also propose the zone of Chaos is replicated in game as a bubble of storm gods around Sol.

An axis may be drawn from the southern point through Sol (centroid of Chaos) upwards towards Olorun.

I believe the zone of the Empyrean is an area denoted by creation deities, and those related to northern aspects eg Sun gods etc, they do seem to form a layer.

I feel this axis is shifted from standard galactic north/south and that it follows the in game greek compass alignment, oh and that the tree of Yggdrasil follows this axis too!

Of course I always hold that I’m equally potentially wrong… it’s just that I’m seeing too many coincidences.
