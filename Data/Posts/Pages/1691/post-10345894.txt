I'm still trying to get my head around this Miltonian cosmology in-game.
As I understand it Sol should be in the centre?
Have you figured out the plane and central coordinates of the Empyrean's floor? (To which the golden chain should be attached)
...it seems to me that the axes are shifted wrt galactic coordinates, especially looking at the "Greek wind compass" which seems quite a lot shifted and not orthogonal.
Does the axis of this cosmology pass through Axis Mundi system?
I'm assuming system "Fall" should lie on that Empyrean floor?
