Yes, that shows my reason for disbelieving the Greek Winds Compass- North is pointing to the top of the Empyrean. Instead of along the plane of the Empyrean's floor...it should be rotated vertically through 90Â°. I think that's highlighted if you overlay Fall...if that represents where Satan & his legions were expelled from Heaven it should be on the North side of the Empyrean floor because Milton has the North as the location of their rebellion and expulsion.
