Yes, that shows my reason for disbelieving the Greek Winds Compass- North is pointing to the top of the Empyrean. Instead of along the plane of the Empyrean's floor...it should be rotated vertically through 90°. I think that's highlighted if you overlay Fall...if that represents where Satan & his legions were expelled from Heaven it should be on the North side of the Empyrean floor because Milton has the North as the location of their rebellion and expulsion.
Yup how true.

The compass points for North / South I initially thought were just applicable to ‘up and down’ it’s just so odd that these do correlate with the positions of ‘higher gods and lower gods’ aspects building an upper area and a lower area…

But you’re correct, in my only recent reading I now acknowledge that all the compass points ought to align on a 2D plain, from the view point of ‘god’ looking down.

This is why it’s integral to sense check this data. Is it correct; how can we make sure it’s accurate; did the devs do this intentionally; is this broken?

Remember that FD turned off the original PF/DW missions…

Remember there are lots of errors in star positions and various bugs in game.. what is intentional by design, what is simply wrong by accident?!

It’s still very peculiar…why; or am I simply looking for affirmation in game where there isn’t any?

Irrespective the one thing I dislike about this puzzle is the glaring hole in the process; but that is our primary problem, we are dealing with an allegorical puzzle with basically no fixed reference points, in a haystack made of needles, where the ‘obvious’ reference points (DW) turns out to be either broken or simply a lie.
