Been asked to repost certain images for context and sense checking:

Image below is of all systems named after gods I’ve ‘currently’ found (each are listed elsewhere in the thread and I’m find more all the time). The image is in line with galactic north. I have overlaid the Greek compass too for comparison.

Note how it’s a little tiered, or stepped, the lower area to the hypothetical South East is the Lost Realms zone.



Then next is the same image but with the systems (not all) that hit the Underworld description (red) any gods in that zone are also underworld gods, I just ran out of patience and left them white - but you get the drift.

Those that hit the storm description are purple, again not coloured them all…

Note how the underworld is rather expensive and the upper gods sort of form a peak above the hypothetical chaos zone?



This last one shows the compass tilted, along with the Morrigans, and Brookes Tours, which goes through the Lost Realms and intersects a triad set of goddesses, further along a system called Michel and Sopedu ‘the Guardian of the East gate seem to align with the Greek compass for East?
