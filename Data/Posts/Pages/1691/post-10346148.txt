The short version: everything seems to be built around a Miltonian Cosmos with the mythical Yggdrasil kind of establishing the layers. It is much like Michael Brookes' famous tattoo. Where and what Raxxla is exactly are still very much a matter of debate. That said, codex seems to provide a few way to investigate that somewhat parallel each other. Beyond that, that is the current state of affairs. Michael Brookes was a huge fan of John Milton's "Paradise Lost".
