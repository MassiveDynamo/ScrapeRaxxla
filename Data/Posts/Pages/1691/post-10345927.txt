Mmm, if I read PL correctly then Satan and his legions were expelled from the North side of the Empyrean, where their rebellion started, so Fall should be on the North side and placed at the level of the Empyrean floor. I'm now suspicious of the Greek Winds Compass- it seems to be totally at odds with the axes of Miltons cosmos...Boreas/Notus seems to be vertical!

And if Raxxla is Milton's "pendent world" how long is the "golden chain/staircase"??
