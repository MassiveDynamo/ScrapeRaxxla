Regarding the rogue planet, which is classified as a star type... while looking for the video I mentioned before, there's a discussion where they say that there's no limits for planet's size but the bigger ones are able to retain their atmosfere, hence a gas giant... and from in-game description, these Y class stars are actually gas giants with stellar propperties.

So, a Rogue Planet could be a Class Y star not big enough to keep its own burning atmosfere... which over time turned itself onto a planet...
True that Y class are most often described as Substellar objects, however the data shows a Y class and Rogue Planet as star types. Would seem strange to have the same body classified as two different things. Plus some Y types would then scan as Rogue Planets since thatâ€™s the data description.
