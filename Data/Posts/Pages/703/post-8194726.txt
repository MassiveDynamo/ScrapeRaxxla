'More likely to reveal itself to a group of players' would seem to negate the comment that 'it's a journey everyone must make for themselves'. Like exact opposite. This was probably in reference to FR
True but it could also be taken (if this was pre FSS) that you didn’t need a ADS since you can technically find all planets in a system with just a basic one, and at that point you’d have the old fly upside down around the planet for ages looking for a structure of some kind, which would be easier to achieve in a group. From that point if the structure had items to scan etc perhaps there are generated missions that you can’t share with others since it would be unique to you. Scan and then “retrieve this item from such and such a system” and it would be a unique mission item to you. And so a series of these or something of the like is something you would have to do alone.
