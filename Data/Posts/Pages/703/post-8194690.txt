I'll drop this here beacuse I was not able to find again the interview with D.Braben video.
Someone asked him about Raxxla and the answer was:

DB: "- It would be more likelly to reveal itself to a group of players."
Interviewer: "- How so?"
DB: "- If you are at the right place and you scan it enough..."
Interviewer: "- Advanced scanner or the basic one?"
DB: "- Basic scanning is enough."
Interviewer: "- But you have to be Elite..."
DB: "- You have to be Elite."

If someone could help me find this video again... I watched it before the release of Horizons.

Never heard that one, and Iâ€™ve only recently watched all the vids on the FD YT channel- find the source and update action for Macros??

Edit: was this definitely for Raxxla? YouTube or other? Vid or audio??
