Some good comments there Commanders!
Need someone to collate comments & progress ths list and submit the questions on the day; unfortunately that day IRL I am busy and will have to catch up afterwards.

Is there a source to authenticate that “honked but not discovered” is incorrect? We’ve not found one so far either for or against.
