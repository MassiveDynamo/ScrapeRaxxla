RE: DB "- It would be more likelly to reveal itself to a group of players."

I dont recall this one but using a little logic, previously the basic scanner had limited range. You had to honk a few times to scan an entire system and even then you could miss something. If this recalled Q/A is correct DB maybe referencing the mechanism of older exploration.

I seem to recal another 'unfounded' DB qoute that supposedly was along the same lines; in that you should have to scan multiple systems in the area for it to reveal itself. This was disproven some time ago.

Groups of Cmdrs working together in exploring may using that theory find it quicker, and multi honks would eventually and naturally uncover it. If correct it doesn't really provide much insight other than its a multi scan object, no clue as to where.

But now of course our current module negates this theory surly?

And dont call me Shirley.
