'More likely to reveal itself to a group of players' would seem to negate the comment that 'it's a journey everyone must make for themselves'. Like exact opposite. This was probably in reference to FR

No, not Formidine Rift-related. The Zurara is detectable, as I remember (itâ€™s a while since I visited her) when within the usual 1000ls; though probably now detectable by FSS scan on entry into system. And rank is irrelevant to finding her.

If Koben is correct in his recollection of this then it must be either Raxxla and/or TDW station; it sounds more like the latter, which may be rather telling if the context was Raxxla-I suspect Raxxla may be a Guardian/Goid planet-sized ship and TDW station might well be orbiting it. It would be an appropriate place for a band of adventurers/explorers to locate their station.
