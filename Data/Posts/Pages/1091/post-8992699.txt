This is some pretty harsh libel if you ask me cmdr. I've followed @GURU-951 videos for a good while and though entertaining and at times informative, I've never seen him personally state that any of his theories or discoveries were successful in finding Raxxla. Only that they were his own theories and subsequent results of him testing them. Peer review and testing is the cornerstone of scientific study when looking for repeatable results. I've never had the feeling that he was a cult leader or that I was being brainwashed.

Maybe it's like the jedi mind trick and only works on the weak minded .

Either way Guru is a stand up researcher and I've learned significant information from his constellation tours and other similar info he's put out and worked on.
1. Not sure why you are digging up a 2019 post as I've been away for a bit. Edit: Ah I see now, it wasn't you that referred originally to the 2019 post.
2. I'm not sure where the controversy is at when @GURU-951 has publicly apologized for misleading us about finding Raxxla. He even has a video on it admitting fault and even in this thread iirc.
Lets just move on.
