But I spent a while flying around Jupiter’s orbit line (very strange that Pluto doesn’t have one! Though did check the L4 &L5 positions Sunday by distances from Pluto and Sol) a while ago and found no asteroids.
Pluto is a double planet, with Charon. They orbit a common barycenter that is outside Pluto. The orbit line for such barycenters are never shown in ED.
