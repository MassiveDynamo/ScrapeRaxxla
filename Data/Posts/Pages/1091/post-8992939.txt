The darkwheel logo is ouroboros, im sure you know the meaning, what i surmised is the orphicus region, checked some in game systems in the region but nothing in the systems that are in the real system, some which are not In elite, you also cant find anything orphicus by name in elite.
The Dark Wheel ouroboros logo is fan made by the Children of Raxxla folks and is not official canon. [Ninja'd, can't delete posts anymore?]
