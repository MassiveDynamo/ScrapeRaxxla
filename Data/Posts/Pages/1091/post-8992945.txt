Wait- I've got such a stupid idea, so stupid that I should get it dismissed by others.
Thargoids - spacefaring creatures - loves space/star(probably?) - astrophel
Spiraling stars - those spiraling creatures... 'thargoids'...
Have anyone thought about the idea that the princess might be a Thargoid?
Well this isn't saying that 'I found RAXXLA' but certainly it means something.
