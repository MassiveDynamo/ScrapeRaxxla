Pluto is a double planet, with Charon. They orbit a common barycenter that is outside Pluto. The orbit line for such barycenters are never shown in ED.
I've also noticed persephone in Sol is huge compared to its RL counterpart....

1. Not sure why you are digging up a 2019 post as I've been away for a bit. Edit: Ah I see now, it wasn't you that referred originally to the 2019 post.
2. I'm not sure where the controversy is at when @GURU-951 has publicly apologized for misleading us about finding Raxxla. He even has a video on it admitting fault and even in this thread iirc.
Lets just move on.
Someone literally was calling him a cult leader on the last page. As far as his 'apology' it's not his fault some of his viewers are idiots and took his theories for searching as gospel. He only apologized because he felt bad they took his ideas as gospel. That was their fault. He never said 'hey guys this is it I found the way. Idiots assumed he said that vaguely because that's the fdev way
