Could this mean that a Gate could be found on or around a world called "Winter D" or something similar? A quick search in EDDB and I only found the System Fimbulwinter which has no Body "D" except for the Moons 2d and 7d. I know Alien World is not Cannon, but we since don't know what cannon in withing ED with regard to Raxxla, we can make up anything...

I've ran just about every possible name from The Alien World through the galaxy map and haven't found anything ...
