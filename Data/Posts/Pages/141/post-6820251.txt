Already stated Raxxla is not really "a planet" in Oolite. Already confirmed it's a "celestial body" in ED.

Well yeah I'm mixing up those. I am more expecting Raxxla to be one of the yet undiscovered classes mentioned in the Journal documentation. Especially "Exotic" X-type "Star" since a Rogue Planet is still a planet. But still, since we "don't know what it is though" it could be anything.
