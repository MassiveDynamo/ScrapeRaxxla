Oops, have I missed one of your posts? I still have listed as unvisited:
DRYU BRA XX-L A21-0
DRYU BRA XX-L A63-0
OOSCS BRA XX-L A76-0
OOSCS BRA XX-L A117-0

The clue is in Michael Brooke's clue "There will be no clues." Weird way to word something. He could have easily took the PR route and said something like, "we won't be offering anymore clues" or "there will be no more clues on Raxxla at this time" in a more completed manner...but therein lies the clue? Raxxla leaves no clues. It leaves no indication. I'm thinking now that it was laughable for me to think, that I was looking for something on a map shortly after I'd pinged the system. Of course after it's found by that person it will be visible from then on for that person.

There are two issues working against our finding it. First of which is our big drives we strive to attain, shortly after buying a ship. To find Raxxla we need to be using efficient routes to simulate the old days, and so we don't miss too much. The second thing is we enter system, ping, look at map, leave...it has become systematic and a lot less explorational. We tend to also over complicate statements and clues, and start running to decode and convert things to decimal values and the like lol. It's not going to be that crazy.

I'm hoping that discoveries like Raxxla are going to change everything. Once we find Raxxla and use it I bet we, from then on, open that side of the gateway and back to Raxxla. It would make it more convenient for us to access places around the galaxy, but we'll still need to obviously jump to locations where gates aren't. We may even need to find the other gates. I think this is when Raxxla mystery and the Formadine rift mystery will finally come together and create something a bit "Mass Effect Relay."
