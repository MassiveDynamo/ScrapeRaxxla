"The Eye Of The Beholder. A Raxxlan projection which appeared above the primitive world Winter D, populated by sentient, but unadvanced insectoids. The Eye became an overwhelming symbol of the evil that stared from the heavens, so disorienting the creatures that the Oisir-Raxxla were able to build their structure and depart without life being lost."

Could this mean that a Gate could be found on or around a world called "Winter D" or something similar? A quick search in EDDB and I only found the System Fimbulwinter which has no Body "D" except for the Moons 2d and 7d. I know Alien World is not Cannon, but we since don't know what cannon in withing ED with regard to Raxxla, we can make up anything...
