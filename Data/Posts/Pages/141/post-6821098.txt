Mass-codes stop at letter H, so there cannot be RA XX-A L Systems. If it's in the Name, it can only be a System with A mass code, so a very light Primary star, like all the Brown dwarfes I've found in those Systems.

But here I'm asking again: should we look for Raxxla or maybe for Oisir?


The start sceen is edited for the looks. There are no stations in such low Orbit between a such Close binary pair of planets. Nothing here.

I’ve rechecked the system naming & see that the system must end with “A”, but if obfuscated implies garbled then couldn’t RAXXL be permutated?

Don’t think “Oisir” has much going for it; The Dark Wheel novella used the name “RAXXLA” as, from what DW said, did David Braben.

Agree that the close orbit f the station in the start screen is suspicious, but didnt think the start screens implied a binary pair of planets. Must have another look, when the server is back online........zzzzzz
