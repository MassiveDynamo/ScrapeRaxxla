Q: Does Razzla exist?
There's an interesting one, what a silly question, of course. You don't know what it is though.

I also asked -again- if the lost missions would be reinstated again during the segment with Will & Adam (1hr42).
The question was directed to Adam but Will answered it - and no surprise, fobbed off again with "no information about that at the moment", "but as soon as we do, we'll let you know".
What is it now, 2.5 years since they got left out, bug reports and livestream/Q&A requests for an update and this is still all FD can say?
I think those missions are never coming back, and most likely have little relevance to anything. From my point of view, it's also pretty clear that they aren't going to fulfill the "Founding Members of the Elite" KS pledge either with regards to having special and rare missions - why else does the community guy jump in to answer rather than the missions team member? pfffft.
Well, if anyone cares about the original missions listed in the OP then I suggest you make some noise, but I'm done.
