But you can't know if the tagged system has been actually reported and claimed to Cartographics. The discoverer may never do it. Lot of tagged systems by myself are in EDD/EGO/ EDSM but not in GalMap. I am used to selfdestruct when I need to go back to SD in a hurry, like yesterday (for almost nothing, as the Guardian booster doesn't work with maxed jet or mat boosts...)
And in the opposite way, not everybody uses EDSM.
