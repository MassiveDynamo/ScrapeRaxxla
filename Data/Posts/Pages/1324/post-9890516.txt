I do like this hypothesis, it’s very similar to that proposed by @Allen Stroud yet to have FD employees in control rather than players is more practical and not impossible to monitor, but it does ask the question, whats next?

The only negative is there now must be hundreds of thousands of Elite Cmdrs… if applicable there must be another step surely.

Currently still only ‘Dangerous’ as in my opinion, obtaining Elite is unfortunately only inevitable and linked to time, not necessarily skill, and I’ve never played to grind, I’m in now rush. But I’ll keep it in mind.
Yes, the odd thing is that it doesnt seem to lead anywhere. If these “friends” gave you tip offs, or hints, or something then it would make sense. But they just seem to be a dead end.
