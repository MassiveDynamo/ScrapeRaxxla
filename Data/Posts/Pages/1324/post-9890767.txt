Ah, sceptics of the world unite, in disbelief!

But I’m also a sceptic, and I don’t believe that DB and MB would have just inserted an easter egg into a random system among 400,000,000,000 others and would not have left some clues as to how to find it.
But I do wish we knew what we were looking for!
I think they did exactly that - because otherwise it isn't 'a journey that you take for yourself'.* If (when) you figure out the clues and post them online, Raxxla becomes nothing more than a tourist destination, the same as Sag A and Beagle Point.
I continue to hold to the theory that there is a 'personal' trigger which unlocks whichever permit is required to visit Raxxla - despite having no idea what said trigger is.

* except in the very simplest interpretation that Raxxla isn't in the starter system.
