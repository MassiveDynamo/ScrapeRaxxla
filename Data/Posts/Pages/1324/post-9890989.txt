A minor spoke perhaps! Think the kickstarter bonus was just a first (alright, major!) step along the way.

I still think the point of getting into SD was to see the tourist beacons and realise there are different factions (different spellings!) within PF. And one TB points out that TDW are a faction within PF...dont think SD is the end of the journey! One faction becomes allied on killing goids, local branch in SD by missions, so think there’s another which is TDW...

But apart from my hand problems preventing hypothesis testing it is 31C in my lounge, hotter in the bedroom, and Ive been sneezing all afternoon, think there’s extra pollen around! Dont think the copawlot is going to get an evening walk tonight! And don’t think I’m going to get much sleep!
