But apart from my hand problems preventing hypothesis testing it is 31C in my lounge, hotter in the bedroom, and Ive been sneezing all afternoon, think there’s extra pollen around! Dont think the copawlot is going to get an evening walk tonight! And don’t think I’m going to get much sleep!
Climb inside your PC case - it's got all the fans and the dust filters will deal with the pollen.
