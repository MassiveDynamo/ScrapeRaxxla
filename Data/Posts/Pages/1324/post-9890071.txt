I do like this hypothesis, it’s very similar to that proposed by @Allen Stroud yet to have FD employees in control rather than players is more practical and not impossible to monitor, but it does ask the question, whats next?

The only negative is there now must be hundreds of thousands of Elite Cmdrs… there must be another step surely.

Currently still only ‘Dangerous’ as I’m in now rush to grind. But I’ll keep it in mind.
Easiest elite is exploration (see road to riches tutorial), then IMHO trade ( buy an Imperial Cutter, engineer it, fill the cargo holds appropriately & when interdicted if you cant shake them fly backwards blasting the blighters!). Combat with goid Scouts is fun but a bit of a grind. I did it in Celaeno, but the Proteus Wave CG should give plenty of opportunity.
