Just re-reading previous messages about comets. They may not have visuals implemented, but they are in the code/stellarforge/universe as points (but presumably with no mass). IMHO I think that means they’re in-game, but that’s just semantics.

What puzzles me is that some people have seen them as a pop up notification on the nav panel (e.g. https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threa...ormal-space-close-to-them.350586/post-5486213), but I cant seem to drop out of SC at it after targeting the USS and getting the drop-out message.
What they saw in the bottom the hud (front panel, not left) is the closest body from the ship.
It is a usually thing but we never pay attention to it.
Sometimes there is for example "Isinor 2" because we are in its influence zone; sometimes there is just "deep space" when we are not in influence zone of any body in the system.
AND sometimes, very rare due to the size, we can see either "Asteroid belt" (for SOL) or if very lucky "Pareco Comet 1".

It's in the code of the game and they cannot hide a body if we are close enough to it (influence zone).
