I think they did exactly that - because otherwise it isn't 'a journey that you take for yourself'.* If (when) you figure out the clues and post them online, Raxxla becomes nothing more than a tourist destination, the same as Sag A and Beagle Point.
I continue to hold to the theory that there is a 'personal' trigger which unlocks whichever permit is required to visit Raxxla - despite having no idea what said trigger is.

* except in the very simplest interpretation that Raxxla isn't in the starter system.
And that “personal journey” is the one thing that keeps my mind wandering (it frequently wanders!) back to Shinrarta-the one system that is only unlocked when Elite rank is achieved. But the way you attain that rank is very personal to you.

Not saying that Raxxla is in SD, or is SD; perhaps Raxxla is the pirates you killed on the way?
