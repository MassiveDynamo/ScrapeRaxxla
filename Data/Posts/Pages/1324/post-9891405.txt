Climb inside your PC case - it's got all the fans and the dust filters will deal with the pollen.
Ive lost 22 pounds since Christmas, and my waistline is much slimmer. But I still couldn't fit into my PC case!

Besides, the dam thing has started to switch off after a couple of minutes & reboot. I suspect recent Windows10 updates! I cleaned the dust filter recently, though could still be overheating with this heatwave. It’s 32.5C upstairs, 27 in the west-facing lounge as I sit here with the curtains closed and a fan blasting away, while awaiting the afternoon sun with accompanying sauna. And this is the cool part of the UK!

I’m looking forward to reading today’s galnet missive; I fully expect a notification that FD regretfully announce Raxxla has melted, and all associated services are cancelled!
