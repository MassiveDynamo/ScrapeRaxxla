I'm volunteer to try this

2 questions :
Where can you find trinkets of hidden fortune?
Is there a way to increase your rank in combat quickly?

oh, be careful with the old MB videos: the conditions for discovering Raxxla may have changed over time, especially since the appearance of Raxxla in the Codex. Deleting videos can mean that they either give too much of a clue, or they have become outdated.

Quickest way to Combat Elite is to kill Thargoid Scouts-they’re all Elite, you get four or more at a time. But you’ll need a ship engineered for xeno combat, there are videos on youtube about it. e.g. Thargoid Scout Killer | Build Guide | Elite: Dangerous - YouTube

Edit: and it seems there may be a gameplay-related reason behind getting unusual friend requests when you attain an Elite rank (only FDev should be aware of this), so if you get any accept & see if it leads to anything!

edit2: MMM, a thought- what if we get an FDev-originated Friend request on attaining Elite, but different one for each specialisation? Accept three & be invited to join TDW??
I'm antisocial and prefer playing alone, so would have rejected any such requests...
