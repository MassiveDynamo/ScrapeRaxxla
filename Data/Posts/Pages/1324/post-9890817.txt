And that “personal journey” is the one thing that keeps my mind wandering (it frequently wanders!) back to Shinrarta-the one system that is only unlocked when Elite rank is achieved. But the way you attain that rank is very personal to you.

Not saying that Raxxla is in SD, or is SD; perhaps Raxxla is the pirates you killed on the way?
Whatever level of Kickstarter backer I was (it's been a while, so I forget) gave the Shinrarta permit for new Cmdrs, which kinda disproves your theory - but only if you believe FDev are sufficiently organized not to accidentally make Raxxla available to a new player (jury is out on that one )

That said, I think Shin and TDW are the key - I reckon they're the faction that'll give the permit.

Note that the 'un-unlockable' permit systems say that 'The Pilots Federation is not issuing permits'
