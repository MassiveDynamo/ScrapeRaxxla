well, I don't know what's happening/not happening! I'm still in Pareco trying to drop in on a point in space which is labelled "Pareco comet 1/2" in the nav panel, but it ain't happening!
I'm viewing this as a training opportunity, and failing miserably!
Anybody got video of this happening that I can watch?
I want to achieve this, because I suspect this is likely the Raxxla obfuscation mechanism (once we find the correct system and "comet"!)
I can reliably get on the USS spot within 1 metre according to nav panel, just not getting the text displayed! Since others have achieved this I must be doing something wrong...
