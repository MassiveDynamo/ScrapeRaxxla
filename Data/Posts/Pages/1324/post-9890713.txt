Ah, sceptics of the world unite, in disbelief!

But I’m also a sceptic, and I don’t believe that DB and MB would have just inserted an easter egg into a random system among 400,000,000,000 others and would not have left some clues as to how to find it.
But I do wish we knew what we were looking for!
