arent these kind of crosses representing 4 seasons - rotation of big dipper (ursa major) on the sky during the year?
also kinda funny seeing taranis there ^^
Ive been a Druid for over 40 years and i dont know anyone that can answer that question, truth is much of our culture is guess work as nothing was ever written down except works by the Romans and Christain authors who all had their own agendas.
Most things are centered around Three as in the Awen symbol.

Also there's a line in Peter Berresford Ellis's book 'The Origins Of The Druids' that says:
It has been argued that the closest parallel to Artemis, daughter of Zeus and twin sister of Apollo, was Brigit 'the exalted one'
