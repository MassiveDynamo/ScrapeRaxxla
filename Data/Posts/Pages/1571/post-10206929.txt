I did remember something else about Brighid from my time in Ireland (Innisfail - Island of Destiny), there's a statue of her in Kildare in the grounds of an old church (shes actually next to a well), the christians made her into a saint (they absorbed many of our names and festivals) and the church is actually built on an old Druidic sanctuary.
So shes linked with old and modern but yes also the triple goddess theory.

The cross


Not sure if any of this is relevant
I have a lot of old fable books, im sure there are plenty of stories about her, will have a look through and see if anything relates to our quest.
