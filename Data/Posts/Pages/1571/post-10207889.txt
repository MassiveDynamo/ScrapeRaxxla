If such systems we’re generated by an algorithm or simple list, I would image such names would be spread wide across the bubble.

Thing is, they are not. There is a behavioural trail here, a hotspot of locations. If this is an algorithm it’s an example of a bug. Maybe someone should post a ticket

Secondly these systems all tie in with the description within the codex, Atlantis etc, thirdly these systems names are given in Robert Holdstocks Lost Realms book within the introduction chapter.

Fourth, we have Demeter positioned in alignment with Persephone, pointing to this area. Fifth we have this location falling along a projected sphere of influence made by the date 2296… then the path of Brookes Tour intersects this area! Oh and Yggdrasil… I could go on and on, I am just repeating what’s already been posted.

At a minimum it’s an Easter Egg, but the codex I believe with a good deal of experience in plotting is telling us something about this sector.
Take the lost realms systems as an example. You have the names in ‘the names’ list, after each other.
When you append this list to the ‘systems that need a name’ list, it is reasonable that the end up in systems close to each other.

Doing it this way is easy and as a bonus you get a sense of regional connection between systems.
