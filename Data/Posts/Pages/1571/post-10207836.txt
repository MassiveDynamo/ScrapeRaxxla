I doubt that MB would make Raxxla a meta pusle. There is no reason to do that. There are plenty of RL stars and constelations that can be used to make a connection to mythology.
I hate be bearer of this news: the lore is so "meta" that we had to figure out if it was the same Universe. Also, there was the tiny little matter uncovering fact vs fiction in Old World's region between Lavian propaganda, ship manufacturer buy-outs to bury some history of specific ships, and then there is the Imperials trying to hide just how much control they exert on the Old Worlds Coalition region. That is just the tip of the proverbial iceberg.

The Codex Knowledge Base section on individuals has little lessons buried in each entry in the section. Read them. They are ideas that appear to apply to the larger story including Raxxla and The Dark Wheel.

I would strongly suggest you start trying to figure out why Vetitice is in the very heart of GalCenter G1. Also, if Lave wasn't a dictatorship prior to Walden your problems are multiplying rapidly.

The fact that Lave is a dictatorship in the first game should terrify CMDRs. That singular fact on its' very own is more than capable of shifting the commonly understood and assumed timelines. Small details can have big consequences.
