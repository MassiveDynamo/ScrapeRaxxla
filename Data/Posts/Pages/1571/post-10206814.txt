Cool.

I’m sold on Brigid, as it’s very close to Avalon, which ties to RH’s text. Here’s a short extract from my current notes (to be published soon).

‘Avalon - RH p18 vale of. RH talks of a Moon goddess associated with horses (Epona p27) p22 and a mystic earth goddess, naming Morgan La Fay as a possible link with the triad Celtic goddess ‘The Morrigan’, a fertility and war goddess p23. With Excalibur - Lady of the lake RH attributes with ‘Brigga’ p25 a water goddess. RH identifies here how water is a barrier between the real and these ‘otherworlds’. Morgan La Fay is mentioned again on p25 accompanying Arthur on his death barge with three hooded women or three queens, RH calls these the tri-partite goddess’ - Robert Holdstock Lost Realms.
Oh darn, you’ve started me googling again!
On tripartite goddess wikipedia says “Various triune or triple goddesses, or deities who appeared in groupings of three, were known to ancient religion. Well-known examples include Tridevi (Saraswati, Lakshmi, Kali)”...now we have GCS Sarasvati in-game as a megaship (unit 1?) from Project Thunderchild...so are there two other megaships to be found?

Triple Goddess (Neopaganism) - Wikipedia
en.m.wikipedia.org

We did look a couple years ago but found nothing...so is this another hint to tri-via?

Edit
It goes on to say “Diana (Artemis) also came to be viewed as a trinity of three goddesses in one, which were viewed as distinct aspects of a single divine being: "Diana as huntress, Diana as the moon, Diana of the underworld"...
so was MB’s use of Artemis in Legacy book a hint to Diana? Is there one in-game?? Ive already pointed out that Mother of Galaxies could well be Mother Gaia, i.e. Earth and the Moon could be the “jewel on her brow”
