The whole triad business could simply be a positional clue. Eg Artemis etc = Persephone, eg the Underworld area, likewise Epona etc = Avalon eg the lost realms area…

The Lost Realms are really packed into one location. It could just be as simple as ‘look here’?
I think they are packed in one region because they are taken from the same list of names. You find these clusters of connected names all over the bubble.
Before release FD had to give names to all the inhabited systems that didn't have one after star catalogues and the old games names had been added.
They probably used lists like you find on this page: https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_deities
These were used to fill the holes. Clumping of similar / connected names is bound to happen, when you do this. It also ads a bit of flavour to the bubble, so there is no reason to randomize it.

There might be a few manually named systems, but not the hundreds of systems that falls in to this pattern.

From an ingame perspective it would also be very strange. Why would the handfull of people(NPCs) that actually know where Raxxla is and try to keep it secret from everyone else, go around naming systems that point to Raxxla. Even if they had the power to name any system, I don't see their motivation for painting arrows in the sky.
