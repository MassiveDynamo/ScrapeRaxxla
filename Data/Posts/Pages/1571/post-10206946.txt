Oh one other thing: Merlin is Peter Jameson but also all CMDRs (we are after all his grandchildren or possibly just clones via Project Thunderchild mentioned at GCS Saravasti). In other words, we are fighting ourselves, until we accept our true nature. This is why the letter in the manual of Frontier and First Encounters is addressed to Sirocco Station, Merlin, Ross 154. He is the many-formed trickster of the story. So, yes, Jameson is ancient beyond words. In an article about Holdstock's "The Broken Kings" he described Merlin as follows:

The Merlin in my cycle of stories, the Codex, is a configuration of ideas; the endlessly travelling traveller; the man outside of Time; the wise man and the Fool, embodied in the flesh; the shape-changer who challenges nature. Merlin is the consummate dream of Power over Nature and Weakness over Man.
