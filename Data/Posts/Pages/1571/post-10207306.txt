Mmm, still pondering triple goddess relating to the asterisk at the centre of the Raxxla logo. Not convinced that relates to Hecate because she was the goddess of the tri-via, a “Y-junction”, not an asterisk.

Diana was the Roman equivalent of both Artemis and Hecate. Also, your asterisk is formed by 2 3-way splits that are inverted. As above, so below...

Diana was known by a number of epithets over the centuries. For her tripartite personality, she was known as both Diana Triformis and Diana Trivia. She was also called Diana Caelus, or “Heavenly Diana,” a common epithet amongst the members of the Roman pantheon.

There is also Diana Lucifera (see wikipedia).

Where do think this rune (ᛉ or ᛤ) comes from?

The Triple Deity or Third Way

Diana – Mythopedia
Diana was the Roman goddess of the hunt, unspoiled nature, and the boundaries separating wild from civilized, living from dead. Master of the bow, she roamed the wilderness seeking adventure and hunting game.
