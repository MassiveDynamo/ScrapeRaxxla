To add in the odd detail of the system the Orbital period between both suns are exactly the same

CD-73 253 A Orbital Period is 3,979,757.4 D
CD-73 253 B Orbital Period is 3,979,757.4 D
Nothing odd at all. this is how 2 bodys with comparable masse (0,9258 vs 1,3359) orbit each other. And because each Body orbits the other the period is exactly the same.
CD-73 253 A is a bit heavier so it is Closer to the Barycenter. Draw a straight line between the Stars it will always go through Barycenter, so the Stars are always 180Â° off each other.
