I was just reading another thread about Soontill. Though there is already a system the stories about the planet definately remind me of what I've read and seen (codex image) about Raxxla.

perhaps Soontil is Raxxla and has (as per the Ryder story) moved; ie was never there but in it's 'new' spot.
you need to read "And Here The Wheel" to see that they are different. Oberon Ryder searched for (and found) Soontill and Neptune Ryder carried on looking for Raxxla. The story of Soontill is described there-in and from you can see that apart from some changes made to the system contents, that the planet in that system is indeed the real deal. But read the book - its a good read..
