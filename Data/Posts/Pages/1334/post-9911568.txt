Werenâ€™t the first ruins found in Col 173 Sector LJ-F c12-0 A 3 along with the Cete mega ship? If so, as the story was told to me is that a Cannon Boffins wife found it after only playing for about 6 months. Sadly I cannot recall that Boffins name.
IIRC the first Guardian Ruins were found on Synuefe XR-H d11-102 1 b
