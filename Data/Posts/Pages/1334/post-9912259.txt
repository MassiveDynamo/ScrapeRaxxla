you need to read "And Here The Wheel" to see that they are different. Oberon Ryder searched for (and found) Soontill and Neptune Ryder carried on looking for Raxxla. The story of Soontill is described there-in and from you can see that apart from some changes made to the system contents, that the planet in that system is indeed the real deal. But read the book - its a good read..
Ummmm ya the soontill in game is nothing like the soontill in the book. Wrong location wrong stuff in system…. Wrong everything… But sure, its the real deal.
