I was just reading another thread about Soontill. Though there is already a system the stories about the planet definately remind me of what I've read and seen (codex image) about Raxxla.

perhaps Soontil is Raxxla and has (as per the Ryder story) moved; ie was never there but in it's 'new' spot.
Careful friend, when you go the Raxxla = Soontill route you might never return. I’ve been down here for years babbling to myself after plaguing this thread with countless delusions. It’s dark and lonely down here but it’s home. If you insist on staying there’s a futon you can use in the corner and I’m willing to listen.
