Ummmm ya the soontill in game is nothing like the soontill in the book. Wrong location wrong stuff in system…. Wrong everything… But sure, its the real deal.
But what if.... Raxxla / Soontil was swapped. From book to game. The desc of Soontill in the book could be close to what we need to look for to find Raxxla....

Especially given the recuent imagery showing a clouded planetoid...
