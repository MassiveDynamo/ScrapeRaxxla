Wrong stuff in system applies to all the books - its likely the galaxy was re-generated (i.e. Stellar Forge was modified) after the final edit of the books, so system contents got altered.

As for wrong place - its impossible to tell where it should be from the book. Much published analysis is flawed. There are several missing hyperspace jumps that make it impossible to tell where is should be.

Finally, the book describes Soontill in detail and it would be meaningless to try and hide it as a secret. The whole story was constructed in order to avoid talking about TDW. The Author wanted to talk about the Dark Wheel but was told it was off limits so he invented a splinter group and attached the search for Soontill to them. It was put in game with TBs to reflect the story, much like the other books.

Some comments from the author himself are relevant:

I don’t believe I ever read that thread from the author before. Thank you for that.

I have to say though, many of the author’s responses make me even more suspicious. He responds with “secret” several times for locations referenced in his book and even states that it’s “odd” when asked about a system that was described as having a planet in it in the book and in the system description, yet the planet isn’t there in game. It’s by no means a smoking gun but now I’m curious if he genuinely thinks it’s odd or if he’s being cheeky and hinting that something is amiss. CD-73 253 was it?
