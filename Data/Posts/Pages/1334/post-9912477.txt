Yup frontier changed things after authors wrote their books and the final “universe” was created… slightly different…but alot of the hand crafted stuff for the books is also there. Something like Soontill being way out in left field from Grandmort is in my mind a deliberate placement.
Frontier had the info- if they wanted it to match the book there are several systems close to Grandmort that could have been renamed Soontill. It indicates to me that the Soontill in game was deliberately moved… possibly away from the “real” soontil to keep it hidden….Or who knows why… And since soontill artefacts seem to be neither Thargoid or Guardian … one wonders.
