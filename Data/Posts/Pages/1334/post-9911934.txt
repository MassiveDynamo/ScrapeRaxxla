Yes, And Here The Wheel explains the large circular marking on the surface of Soonthill in-game.

I would recommend reading all of the supporting e/books (purchasable from the FD Store). They provide a lot of lore and meaning to the game!

Drew Wagarâ€™s Oolite series of books (free downloads) are also good reading, but are not canon lore for the game!
