Trinkets appear in many systems in my experience as cargo of wanted ships. I've picked them up at CNBs in the past, though you have to be fast to scoop them up before other NPCs swoop in (have you noticed that NPCs cheat on scooping speed?)

The only function they have in game that I'm aware of is to elicit messages of respect from NPC's. I had them interdict me on a mission run whilst I was carrying Trinkets and got a message along the lines of " sorry didnt meant to bother one of the big guys" (not the exact text , but the gist of it) and said NPC then wake out without attacking me.

Sap8 containers are described in detail in this thread - they are a secure containment vessel that self distructs if tampered with. They look like ordinary cargo containers but with some extra controls? No-one's ever opened one to my knowledge. Shoot them, and they go bang. Bump into them they go bag, etc. Not many types of interaction to try, though I guess if you knew who the recipient was then taking them to the right recipient might do something..

The missions you reference were handed out by many factions - this may have been a bug, as people were able to get them in other systems other than shindez. So unlikely the giving faction is a lead, seems to me.

I did wonder if the E/F missions were the fabled test, since they cover several different modes of play style - maybe if you can complete them all then you werent meant to be on the invite list. I suspect FD were suprised how many people were doing them all so soon..

Well I got interdicted several times by a persistent pirate out in the Seagull Sector system.

Has anyone tried opening the trinkets to get the crystal for scanning?
