I think FD generally MO is to nerf than fix.

Following the thread (above) it’s evident FD were reluctant to confirm anything from the outset, at most they only acknowledged it once Cmdrs had pressed them on it, even then the most we go out of them was an indirect we’re looking at it and MB saying they were spawning in the wrong places. Then total silence.

I think the opposite - I think they were a very big deal and rather than fixing them FD changed course and totally dropped that entire narrative. I also hold DB is no fan of the Raxxla mythos, in part thats why no oxygen is provided to the discussion. I also suspect the Codex was a substitute and above all a band-aid compromise… but this is only a speculative hunch.
What did Brookes say? There will be no clues. In order to say this, you must either have given a very concrete clue, or you must have a goal like making people search a needle in a haystack. The second option was tried, at least partially, by the players and did not yield any results (the great potato hunt). In this forum of more than 1600 pages, there is still no hypothesis that will satisfy or refute an instinct that has been gnawing at my brain since I first heard about Raxxla.

"A place that is not a place, a door that is also the key."

The very word raxxla itself, this 6-letter word, is the compass, key, road map we are looking for... Or whatever you call it, I have never lost my belief and doubt that if one of us finds raxxla one day, the way to it is through this word. We just don't have the logic to unlock this lock, or we don't have the eyes to see it yet.
