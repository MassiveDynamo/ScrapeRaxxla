Milton says the devil stood above the canopy:
"from Eastern Point
Of Libra to the fleecie Starr that bears
Andromeda farr off Atlantic Seas (west)
Beyond th' Horizon; then from Pole to Pole"

Before he goes to the Sun:
"Through the calm Firmament; but up or downe
By center, or eccentric, hard to tell,
Or Longitude..."

Could this mean that he entered from East / West (Red line) between Libra and Andromeda, but the North / South (Green line) is uncertain?

This one is in galactic view. Horizontal center line is the Milkyway band.

The red and green lines are straight lines on a globe so they aren't accurate, but we get an idea.

The crossing point is at least near what we see as the Magpie bridge.
