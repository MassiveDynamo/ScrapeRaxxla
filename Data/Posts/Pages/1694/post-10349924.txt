In follow up to the above. In game if you believe my interpretation, that a Miltonian cosmological model exists in the bubble, and is not simply imagined projection; then we might have the following architecture:

A zone of the underworld made up of systems all named an after deities linked to death or classical concepts of the ‘Otherworld’.

A zone of Chaos likewise named after deities of chaos, namely wind and thunder or storms.

A zone of the Empyrean named after deities named after creation, the sun or high gods.

‘That universe was the domain of the pantheon Lovecraft described in his mythos and the gods of humanity destroyed them in a war that saw nearly every diety also annihilated.’

‘Our universe was then formed from the bones of the original creators, their followers and the upstart gods lost in the battle’ MB.

One might speculate this was the intended architecture built from the bones of these gods?

We might extrapolate then, that Guardians are examples of typical holy archangels, whilst Thargoid are fallen archangels and or Lovecraftian Older Gods or some type of hybrid?

Does this link into their appearance and naming, as in Greek classical aspects the ‘titans’ were the first beings, the giants before man?

One might speculate in Brookes adaptation he could have replaced archangels (an extension of god) aka the Guardians as the false creator, and the Thargoids are the original progenitors?

This sounds very much like the existing Guardian lore, uncovered by Ram Tah which advocates the Guardians seeded numerous systems (for food and sport) so may have created ourselves, but although they had existed for millions of years prior to humans, that they occupied territories previously seeded by Thargoids. This essentially could indicate Thargoids were here first.
