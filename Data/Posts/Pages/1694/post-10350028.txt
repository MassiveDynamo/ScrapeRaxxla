The wireframe for the Cobra Mk III is practically a duplicate of Guardian Sentinel. The door at rear of the cabin similarly looks like doors at Guardian Sites. Further, Asp Scout looks exactly like a sentinel down to rear engine configuration.







Our ships engineering materials include all manner of crystals. Trinkets of Hidden Fortune mentions knick-knacks and statuettes and that something valuable is hidden within the Trinkets themselves.

Last of all, the Guardian locations nearest Meene are the oldest Ancient Sites. The much newer Guardian Sites are further out. So, there is a definite case to made for an origin within the Bubble.
