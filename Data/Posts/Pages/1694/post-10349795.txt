I know at some point this probably has come up, But what if the Guardian sites have something to do with Raxxla, because the Dark Wheel missions lead to the guardian sites, Makes it sound like Raxxla is a guardian device. Do the locations of the guardian sites have any correspondence with the mythology map thingy you guys have?
I've always thought when it's finally found it would prove to be that Raxxla is Guardian, possibly one of their ark ships that Ram Tah referred to. But the DW missions did not lead to the Guardians, FD made it clear that was the result of the Starship One and Gan Romero stories...after her recovery from time spent in her escape capsule and suffering " visions" Halsey instigated an exploration data survey and analysis which FD said led to the finding of the Guardian sites.

We have no idea why the DW missions were in-game originally nor why they were deleted. Its true that they seemed to be buggy and appeared all over the place, MB commented to that effect but why not correct the bugs rather than delete them? So IMO they were either total obfuscation and pruned out because they weren't cool, or they were reviewed and FD decided correcting the bugs would make the path to Raxxla too obvious.
