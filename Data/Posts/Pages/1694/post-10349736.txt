Any assumptions about Milton are all bubble based, all the systems identified so far do not extend any further out. But that does not discount this theory.

I have only looked at exact name spellings, there do exist a few systems outside the bubble which have some vague naming or relationship links, but I’ve not followed these as the focus of systems looks to be within the bubble, none that I have seen seem to advocate any path outwards… I may be wrong.
