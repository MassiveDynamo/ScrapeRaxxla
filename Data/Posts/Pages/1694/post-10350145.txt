Posting this because I suspect it is relevant given one of the official novels is Nemorensis as in Rex Nemorensis and Diana Nemorensis. Also, it is connected to Lake Nemi and the Golden Bough.

I am seeing lots of references to grove in multiple books of Paradise Lost. There are also TWO TREES: Tree of Life and Tree of Knowledge. We need to find the Tree of Knowledge.

Elite Dangerous: Nemorensis
Elite Dangerous: Nemorensis is a romance novel set in the world of the bestselling computer game Elite. It launched to tie in with Elite Dangerous. It's one of three distinct, but subtly linked novels written by major authors who are fans of the game. This novel was written by Simon Spurrier.[1]...
