I think FD generally MO is to nerf than fix.

Following the thread (above) it’s evident FD were reluctant to confirm anything from the outset, at most they only acknowledged it once Cmdrs had pressed them on it, even then the most we go out of them was an indirect we’re looking at it and MB saying they were spawning in the wrong places. Then total silence.

I think the opposite - I think they were a very big deal and rather than fixing them FD changed course and totally dropped that entire narrative. I also hold DB is no fan of the Raxxla mythos, in part thats why no oxygen is provided to the discussion. I also suspect the Codex was a substitute and above all a band-aid compromise… but this is only a speculative hunch.
