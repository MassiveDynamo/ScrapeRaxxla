Yes, the DW missions involved "data crystals" which seems reminiscent of Guardian tech.
Whatever they were, FD may be happy we're still discussing them 8 years after they were deleted.

I was just wondering about any parallels between Paradise Lost and the game lore- Guardians as the angelic host, Thargoids as the fallen angels, Raxxla as Paradise...still can't help feeling there's a message in MB's tattoo
