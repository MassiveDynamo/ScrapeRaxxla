I think FD generally MO is to nerf than fix.

Following the thread (above) it’s evident FD were reluctant to confirm anything from the outset, at most they only acknowledged it once Cmdrs had pressed them on it, even then the most we go out of them was an indirect we’re looking at it and MB saying they were spawning in the wrong places. Then total silence.
I believe a large part of this is intentional. If The Dark Wheel is secretive and in direct competition with Club Conspiracy/Founders of Shinrarta Dezhra it isn't surprising that TDW keeps a lower profile. In-game Club conspiracy openly called TDW's bluff with Soontill and the relics.

Also, for Club conspiracy to even work it is highly dependent on the older lore. Jason Ryder is taken out by a Cobra Mk III. Serpent symbolism has duality at its' core: widom but at the same time representing death and resurrection. Jason Ryder is taken out by powerful people. We do have have a culprit, Raffe Zetter, who had the means, motive, and opportunity.



Light has no meaning without darkness. You risk everything, if you neglect the darkness. I suspect we already have found sufficient proof to justify the effort that comes next. Earth was the proof that the myth was real. The catch: Raxxla was more than a tiny area of a spiral arm which just happened to be the home to humanity.

Light is easy to love. Show me your darkness.
