Now @Filthymick420 not totally have the wrong idea. The is the idea of turning the wheel, what if the permits are only unlocked if the right superpower is in control nearby. I know it's probably not confirmed but neither is 90% of the ideas or statements we follow but I remember seeing something about we might not be playing the way it was thought we would. Powerplay is there and im pretty sure not too active as it never seems to move to much. What if this is the way to unlock some of these permits?
Kind of like if we put a specific federal system under imperial or alliance control or even one of the various independents. Or even liberated control from various fed/alliance/imperial systems into independent control, subjectively* freeing systems. This could potentially have hidden and undiscovered rewards such as a system permit. Also I've been wondering what if we wrested control in a system that is permit locked to an opposing side. Ie what if we put a system like Vega which requires federal rank to unlock in the hands of the empire. Or the same but reversed with a system like Summerland. Both of these systems seem useless and unnecessary for a permit locked to be on them but maybe that is a form of obfuscation itself

*I say subjectively because it's easy for everyone to have their own idea of what a free system might be
