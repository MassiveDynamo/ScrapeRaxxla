Kind of like if we put a specific federal system under imperial or alliance control or even one of the various independents. Or even liberated control from various fed/alliance/imperial systems into independent control, subjectively* freeing systems. This could potentially have hidden and undiscovered rewards such as a system permit. Also I've been wondering what if we wrested control in a system that is permit locked to an opposing side. Ie what if we put a system like Vega which requires federal rank to unlock in the hands of the empire. Or the same but reversed with a system like Summerland. Both of these systems seem useless and unnecessary for a permit locked to be on them but maybe that is a form of obfuscation itself

*I say subjectively because it's easy for everyone to have their own idea of what a free system might be

Thats exactly what I mean. If people are trying the turning the wheel approach. Who says it can't be turning the power cant also be an idea. They have put alot of effort in and are nearing a point where they will get some sort of idea if they are wrong or right. But to go to such effort it must have spawned from some idea or lead. They may have the right idea but just the wrong thing to change. Nothing says both ideas are wrong though, some systems might be a turning the wheel idea, some might be turning the power.
