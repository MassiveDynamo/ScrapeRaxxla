The first thing I did after getting x3 Elite was get allied with all of the corporations that are mentioned in the codex including Wreaken corporation (or at least the ones that exist in game). There is a few posts in here from me around that time and my exploration of their stations and the strange hydrolic function of the rear of the space stations in general. I went Raxxla mad looking at them in various stations etc and I still think theres something strange about how they look like they could open up (see below)


We've all seen this before, Right under our nose?

This is a hinge, I don't care what anyone says


Does this move?

Ah, the first screenshot is a nice one; it kind of reminds me of the lensing effect of the ingame black holes.

I have visited the Maia black hole and did some experiments, like trying to jump through it by lining up a star, which is pretty much impossible, since the black hole is so small. If you're too far, you don't see if the target star is close to its image; if you're too close you'll hit the exclusion zone when accelerating; well aside from "target obscured".
Then I also kind of tried to recreate the Raxxla-symbol by aligning different stars and nebulas; I had "six" stars forming a hexagon, though I can't say if those were two stars with 2 extra images each or if it was one Einstein Cross (one star = 4 images) and another star had only two images.
