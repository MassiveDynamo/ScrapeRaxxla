The first thing I did after getting x3 Elite was get allied with all of the corporations that are mentioned in the codex including Wreaken corporation (or at least the ones that exist in game). There is a few posts in here from me around that time and my exploration of their stations and the strange hydrolic function of the rear of the space stations in general. I went Raxxla mad looking at them in various stations etc and I still think theres something strange about how they look like they could open up (see below)
