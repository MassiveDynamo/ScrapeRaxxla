Now @Filthymick420 not totally have the wrong idea. The is the idea of turning the wheel, what if the permits are only unlocked if the right superpower is in control nearby. I know it's probably not confirmed but neither is 90% of the ideas or statements we follow but I remember seeing something about we might not be playing the way it was thought we would. Powerplay is there and im pretty sure not too active as it never seems to move to much. What if this is the way to unlock some of these permits?
