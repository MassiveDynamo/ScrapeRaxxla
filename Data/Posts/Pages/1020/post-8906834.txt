Either way it's not likely something one could accomplish without organized effort. This would take as much community coordination as turning the wheel if not more.
It would fit with the idea of easy done in a group and if a minimum rank is required a journey everyone must take for themselves. Maybe if turning the wheel doesn't work someone could convince them it should be renamed Turning on the Power. They already have the player base and commitment.
