Do you understand, that Gaia's map is NOT complete YET as for today ? https://www.esa.int/Science_Explora...tes_richest_star_map_of_our_Galaxy_and_beyond
That one should give us proper 3d coords for closest stars ...so everything we could plot here - are projections and speculations for some degree, and once we have already 3D map inside Elite ...how can we relay on projections to Earth sky ? It MAY match 3D in game only for very close stars I think.

ED uses JD2000 data. IMO you can ignore any source outside of ED which is newer than that unless it's been hand authored.
