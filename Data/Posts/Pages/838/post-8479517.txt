ED uses JD2000 data. IMO you can ignore any source outside of ED which is newer than that unless it's been hand authored.
Like Trappist-1 for example

Elite: Dangerous introduces real-life TRAPPIST-1 system
The space adventure's update 2.3 now reflects NASA's real world data.

However this is damn incredible...

Elite: Dangerous ‘predicted’ the discovery of the Trappist-1 system
Sort of. Developers found something very similar after NASA’s announcement.
