Rookie mistake. Always keep your clay tablet player software updated and ported to astronomical computer. Some of these contemporary spaceships can't even read cuneiform, resulting in hauling tons of burned clay for no purpose at all. This tablet here shows how to reach MULMUL - ð’€¯ð’€¯, the celestial home of anzu birds and other flying creatures. To properly understand the omens involved, a sacrifice of barley flour must be made when Ishtar is in the constellation of Goat-Fish. Anointing your head with sheep-fat before any long distance exploration might also be beneficial.

Hhhhhhh! This is nonsense......as soon as you apply the sheep's fat your tin foil hat immediately starts slipping off! ;-)
