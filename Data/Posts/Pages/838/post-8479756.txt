I wonder do you Raxxla tinfoil hatter's will found use of Fleet Carier at your disposal ?
I want to buy one and put it for some honorable Don Quichotte like service.
I think an FC as essential to finding Raxxla....but that's because I really want one and have absolutely no use for one, so need to justify to myself why I'm doing a complete tour of the rim to save up UC data to buy one
