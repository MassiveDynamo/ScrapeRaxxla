Read the Codex entry on Guardian-Human contact folks.

It makes the connection between Halsey and the Guardians, and states that the planets from Halsey's visions are presumed to be from before things went downhill for the Guardians.

Halsey having encountered Guardian descendants was hypothesised well before that, and not for no reasons.

Thank you I knew i didnt just imagine it lol
