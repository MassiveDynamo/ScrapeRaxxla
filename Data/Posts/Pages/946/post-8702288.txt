Read the Codex entry on Guardian-Human contact folks.

It makes the connection between Halsey and the Guardians, and states that the planets from Halsey's visions are presumed to be from before things went downhill for the Guardians.

Halsey having encountered Guardian descendants was hypothesised well before that, and not for no reasons.
Halsey's visions were in her own words:
"It was wonderful. Amazing. I saw the universe, and our galaxy within it, as I'd never seen it before, and I felt the presence of the real caretakers of our galaxy. The paradox of their existence – tiny yet gargantuan, fleeting yet eternal. They spoke to me as I drifted in the void. It was amazing. I must share their message."

The real caretakers of the galaxy matches well with the ‘bodiless voices’ that Gan Romero heard in Vega.

The Codex entry suggests that these are post Guardian entities. Either pure AI or hybrids that have evolved beyond the need for physical manifestation.
Such an evolution would not be a huge surprise. The Guardian history we have, is mainly from the traditionalists. We know little of what happened to the exiles with AI implants and we know little of what happened to the Constructs, after they destroyed the traditionalist Guardians.
We do know that the Constructs wiped out the Guardians to ensure their own survival. Being AI they were probably very rational about the situation and the chances of them failing to survive are slim.

I believe there is a good chance that Raxxla is linked to post Guardian activity. It's also a fair chance that FD have lett some of the post Guardians visit Earth in early human history, giving rise to the base stories of our mythology.
