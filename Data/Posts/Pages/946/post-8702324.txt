It should be also recalled that the actual discovery of the Guardians in game didn't go to plan, with someone working out a location using the stars in a trailer image and finding the Guardian sites early instead of going on the lead from Halsleys visions, etc.

The codex is written as if that never happened and the original story line had worked through.
