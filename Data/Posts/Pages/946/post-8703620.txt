I've seen them at B class stars, t Tauri's and o classes. I've listened to people tell me they are planetary nebula while I was sat in one with only a neutron star. With the "little bit obvious" MB comment, I wonder what these funny little jewels actually are.

FYI : I am aware he made this comment before the toast existed
Unrelated but I just noticed the name. You and Guru are always like 3 steps ahead of me every time I get an idea to look at an area, I arrive and the planets are all “first mapped my Mattius” or “first mapped by Guru951”. You guys have got some light years under your seats
