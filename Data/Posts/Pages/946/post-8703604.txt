I think the Martian relic is a hint that such contact happened, whether humanity was sapient at that point is TBD- maybe we’ll find out in season 10.
I think the Omphalos Rift “alien artefact” mentioned in the Codex is a pretty strong hint that Guardians are related to Raxxla somehow, not that that helps us to find it given the extent of their travelling. I can’t see that it would fit into what we know of Thargoid technology.
I think it’s quite possible that it’s Guardian related. They’re alien, ancient, advanced and all that. And their ruins bear a striking design philosophy with the Raxxla symbol. Hexagons and wedges and semi circles and circles etc. they look like they’re drawn by the same folks.
always thought the Gaurdian ruins looked a lot like the maps from the probes as well, like the ruins point somewhere but I’m not skilled enough with that kind of thing to investigate that myself.
might give the ram tah missions a go tho. From what I understand anyway nobody has managed to complete them all yet.
