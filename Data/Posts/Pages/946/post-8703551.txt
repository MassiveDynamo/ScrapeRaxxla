So after reading through the entire thread once again... I see no one mentioning Cemiess really; a system where the main planets are named after gemstones/jewels: Emerald and Jade. Has anyone investigated a link with the system, it could be a small lead?
I was just by there today actually. Didn’t stop in but I may have to. Stopped in Delphi, Maia, Atlas and Pleione. The last being the mother of the Pleiades sisters. Might have to give Cemiess a look see. Did get me thinking tho that Maia is the smack center of the Pleiades, the name of the Nebula overlaps the name of the system it’s so centered, and it’s got that black hole there. Like a central rift .
thinking of Cemiess tho, I remember a long while back someone asking DW if there was a reason Prism didn’t have a body to represent green.
it’s got diamond for white, ruby for red and sapphire for blue but no green to complete the RGB trifecta. Yes Cemiess does have the missing gem in emerald. Wonder if there’s a connection?
