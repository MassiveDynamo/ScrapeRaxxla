It should be also recalled that the actual discovery of the Guardians in game didn't go to plan, with someone working out a location using the stars in a trailer image and finding the Guardian sites early instead of going on the lead from Halsleys visions, etc.

The codex is written as if that never happened and the original story line had worked through.
Absolutely.

When the Codex came along in the 3.3 Beta, I did ask whether what was in it represented what was intended to have happened, and how we should treat it, but no answer was forthcoming.

Another proposal that's been floated is that the way it should be treated is that the footage seen in the trailers represents leaked footage captured by Halsey's followers who followed her visions and found the sites. That actually works pretty well as a way of lore-ifying what happened IMHO.
