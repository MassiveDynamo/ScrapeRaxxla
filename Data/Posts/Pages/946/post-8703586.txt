Pics or it didnt happen

Any chance you can remember which one? Id say probably a bug, I know on console they dont always appear right or at all so it is graphics reliant or based, it can be interfered with somehow so theoretically possible to not work properly on PC either..


Fuzzy halos around certain stars on the galmap
If you go to the galmap and deselect every star type on the filter screen, you will end up with a blank map... mostly. But scattered throughout the sectors you will see small gray points. If you zoom in on one, and then re-select all of the star filters or go to "realistic" mode, you will always...
