Good thought, try it! Though I’m a little sceptical as the puzzle should have been soluble from the outset, well before planetary landings etc.

You can get Trinkets at anarchy systems-you need a cargo scanner to identify a ship carrying it, hatch breaker limpets to open their cargo hatch and collector limpets to retrieve them. But ALL the npc go into a feeding frenzy since they’re pirates and you need a good shielded ship-I used a krait mk 2 or Phantom when I last went hunting, got some in an anarchy very close to Shinrarta, passenger ship with 100, I managed to get 5!!

I expect most things have been tried over the years, but I’m not aware of any coordinated scientific study of them. Perhaps @Han_Zen @Macros Black @simulacrae or @yelboc might remember any?

Edit: I have a few trinkets...
