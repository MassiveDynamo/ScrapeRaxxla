We’ll probably not.

In another post they have essentially confirmed that factions bogus?

Also Support obviously knows as little as we do. It’s when they get a Dev to confirm you get the real info, so much of the initial information is third hand.

At most it effectively says, it’s linked to the DW missions / story which was removed.

It doesn’t rule out that Raxxla isn’t in game (eg narrative) but also it doesn’t necessarily rule out Raxxla not being accessible.

It’s equally likely these missions ordinarily led towards Raxxla -that’s my opinion (a tiny bit obvious). But were removed, and I presume after being ignored for some time, later replaced with a different process - evidenced I feel with the inclusion of the Codex.

One of my theories is FD essentially just removed the narrative meat towards Raxxla but left the objective in game for us to stumble over (unless it’s narratively gated, in which case we’re spinning in the breeze!).

Or it’s all just a hot mess.

My investigations such as noted with Support, is not try an illicit information, but identify potential dead ends, and allow us to focus resources where they’re needed, this is something FD does not communicate openly, and essentially a lot of players may have been tipping at windmills for years thinking they are achieving something, when in fact they weren’t (except in the sense within a role playing aspect).

I think the trinkets and SAP8s were meant to lead to the first Guardian site. It was found by other 'methods'.
