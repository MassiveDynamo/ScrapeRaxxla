Ok, my take is:
The Omphalos sat over the volcanic crevice at Delphi and the Seer breathed in the fumes from the Omphalos Stone’s conical hole to enter an exalted state of consciousness for prophecy.

Support said essentially that Trinkets are prohibited because they're prohibited- nothing useful! They don't know & whoever in FD does know isn’t saying, so very likely something meaningful!

IIRC (see Macros’ first post or two in this thread) the original (“deleted” in 2016) elite/founder missions at the station in Shinrarta involved intercept of TDW carrying canisters with data crystals which were believed to contain map information to “the myth”, i.e. Raxxla OR Soontill. Might have been deleed because they gave too much away!?

from the Wiki Trinket containers “appears to hold an assorted collection of low-value trinkets, knick-knacks and statuettes. Such trinkets are generally used by superstitious pilots to try and win favour with the lady Fortuna. However, these particular knick-knacks have a much more valuable prize hidden within.”

I’ve tried listening to Trinkets and they made absolutely no sound for me, so I believe that to be a troll, but may be worth investigating further.

So new hypothesis: Trinket containers have the map crystals & we need to open/activate them to get the information.

We believe Raxxla is alien ( it is discussed in the FD internal “alien lore” document we have no sight into). Has anyone tried placing a Trinket into the Thargoid map machine? Into a Guardian site or beacon? Fired a Guardian energy weapon at it? Placed one on top of the Guardian Relic tower (Relics appearing to have been some anti-air weapon)? taken to TDW station (need to find it first, if it actually exists!!) where it might be activated? .... any more thoughts?? Ive dropped a few into black holes & between binary BH but nothing happened.
