Not actually sure anymore if I posted this here or not. But here it is again; a Support ticket to FD on Trinkets several months old from 2022. The majority of text circles around the subject without answering it, however more insight is obtained near the end.

“found something called trinkets of hidden fortune, they have an odd description to the Greek/Roman goddess Fortuna, and they are illegal goods! Where can I hand these in, as I seem to be finding lots of them currently; and why are they illegal; currently cannot see any point to them, do they have a use or are they just another rare good? Some basic Googling shows these are linked to the Dark Wheel faction missions from 2015/2016, but understand from Forums those missions are removed, is this a bug”.



“How are these items linked to the faction, don’t understand their purpose?”



“Many thanks, that’s very interesting, but it’s very weird how that’s not explained in game, I still don’t understand what I’m supposed to do with them, they pay so little and just make me wanted, yet if they are related to a story or a mission, how can I interact with it, I can’t find anything to direct me to where I ought to go or do with them to trigger this story? much of the text is confusing and not very clear.”



“yes that’s very helpful, it’s just I got the impression from the forums that the Dark Wheel missions related to the trinkets were removed? Are they still active, if so what are they called as I’ve tried that faction and nothing happens. Again thank you for your assistance it’s much appreciated.”

… no active story arc… a curiosity?
