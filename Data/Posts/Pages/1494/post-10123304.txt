Must tried a search on Canonnâ€™s site but no results for Trinkets of hidden fortune...maybe they haven't been properly studied after all? Seems strange though...
There's an abandoned ship log with a story about trinkets and pirates.
A hint to look in this particular system? https://canonn.science/codex/nemb/?highlight=trinkets
