Well, I no longer have absolutely any idea of what is supposed to be canon!
But when the in-game system map is missing the planet which the system description is all about then I have lost faith!
The game was supposed to be scientifically accurate, but the cool red & brown dwarfs should be dull red fading to black, not purple. So I think canonicity has gone out the window!
All the official books are canon, except the parts that aren't.

Same goes for old Galnets.
