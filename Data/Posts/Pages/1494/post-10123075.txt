There is - to my knowledge no link historically between the deity Fortuna (wheel of fortune) and that of Delphi.

The wheel motif of Fortuna was common during the Saxon period an earlier, essentially linked to the thunder gods as a wheel of time / of the seasons… it would be a good fit as some form of activation method… as to if it’s still functional I am highly doubtful, as it’s possible it’s linked to the removed DW missions. A dead end?

Trinkets of Hidden Fortune
This container appears to hold an assorted collection of low-value trinkets, knick-knacks and statuettes. Such trinkets are generally used by superstitious pilots to try and win favour with the lady Fortuna. However, these particular knick-knacks have a much more valuable prize hidden within. —...

I believe @Allen Stroud commented on these Forums that Fortuna was discussed regarding lore, as a link back to the older games but nothing was developed?
