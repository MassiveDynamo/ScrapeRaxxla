Its quite possible that the TDW station logs provide some hint. That would fit with a “Raxxla storyline” and provide the link between TDW and Raxxla. But that station has to be found first.....see my post above about AHTW hypothesis and wonder if FD actually did a quality control check to confirm the assets were placed and activated properly.......

Edit
Perhaps the station provides clues as to how to activate a Trinket of Hidden Fortune?
In that case the search area should be the Frontier gazetteer systems, capitals of the superpowers, capitals of the various power characters, engineers, and any systems otherwise containing unusual amounts of Orbis stations (good luck on identifying a pattern).

Orbis stations only support around 10,000 people and as such are homes of affluent residents. Wealth may be predictive of locations to search.

In another post they have essentially confirmed that factions bogus?

This is covered in Shinrarta Dezra in the beacon Pilot's Federation Interests. Pilots' Federation heavily subsidized colonies. Native factions were usually funded through Pilot's Federation.
