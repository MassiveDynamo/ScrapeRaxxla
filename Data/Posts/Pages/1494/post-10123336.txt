I’ve tried listening to Trinkets and they made absolutely no sound for me, so I believe that to be a troll, but may be worth investigating further

Reminder the Fortuna connection has a key detail that may be important:

Fortuna's identity as personification of chance events was closely tied to virtus (strength of character). Public officials who lacked virtues invited ill-fortune on themselves and Rome: Sallust uses the infamous Catiline as illustration – "Truly, when in the place of work, idleness, in place of the spirit of measure and equity, caprice and pride invade, fortune is changed just as with morality".

In other words, Frontier Developments may have implemented a karmic aspect to the gameplay.
