Not actually sure anymore if I posted this here or not. But here it is again; a Support ticket to FD on Trinkets:

“found something called trinkets of hidden fortune, they have an odd description to the Greek/Roman goddess Fortuna, and they are illegal goods! Where can I hand these in, as I seem to be finding lots of them currently; and why are they illegal; currently cannot see any point to them, do they have a use or are they just another rare good? Some basic Googling shows these are linked to the Dark Wheel faction missions from 2015/2016, but understand from Forums those missions are removed, is this a bug”.

“How are these items linked to the faction, don’t understand their purpose?”

… no active story arc… a curiosity?

Okay, so from official support:
The Dark Wheel in Shinrarta Dezra is The Dark Wheel (kind of disappointing)
No Trinket business right now.
