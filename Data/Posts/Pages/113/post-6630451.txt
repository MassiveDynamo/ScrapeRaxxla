So even tidal locking means little...

There are several planets in EDSM listed as tidally locked but whose rotational period does not equal the time it takes to orbit around it's star. I thought those two variables had to be equal in order for it to be tidally locked?

I suppose there could be other factors though ... maybe they are double planets or moons or something.

The data for LHS 1245 does look promising though. While it doesn't prove anything outright about The Founders World it does leave the question open enough to make the argument that the missing City lights are part of some conspiracy.
