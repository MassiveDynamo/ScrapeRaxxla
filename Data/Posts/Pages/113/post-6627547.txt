Founder's world sea level oxygen level is the equivalent of 20,000 feet on Earth.
Most people would die from hypoxia, rather quickly too.

Maybe the ELW's that don't have lights are in some way inhospitable?

Edit again 2.3 x pressure,,maybe is breathable,,,lotta variables

That does add to the idea of Founder's World being an odd place for the richest most Elite people in the Galaxy to retire to....
