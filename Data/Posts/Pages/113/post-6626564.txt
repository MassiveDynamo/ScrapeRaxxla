Epsilon Eridani system.
Population: 80,000,000
Earth-like-world: New California
Visible city lights: NONE

EDIT: Planet is tidally locked. Still not a good Founders World analog.

Founder's world sea level oxygen level is the equivalent of 20,000 feet on Earth.
Most people would die from hypoxia, rather quickly too.

Maybe the ELW's that don't have lights are in some way inhospitable?

Edit again 2.3 x pressure,,maybe is breathable,,,lotta variables
