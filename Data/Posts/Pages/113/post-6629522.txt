Too many lights.

If there's lights on a planet with 5million people, then that surely means that either the lights aren't related to planetary populations in a strict way, or that they are, but Founders World is exempt? Both of those results are pretty good aren't they?

Based on the picture that seems to be building up, Founders is a very odd planet.

- A month of night time.
- Approx 80million population, no observable lights
- Surface oxygen oddities that might siggest it's not a good place to live/possible to live there
- High surface pressure might siggest it's not a good place to live/possible to live there

Again I do wonder why the PF would pick a planet like that? Given that (in theory) they probably have access to the best explorers out there, and access to the best exploration data, when picking your retirement planet, you'd think you'd pick a really, really nice one?

Looking at it from a Meta perspective - I wonder why Fdev made Founders World to be like that? Presumably it's a hand-crafted system, they could easily have given it paradise stats, but they don't seem to have done that?
