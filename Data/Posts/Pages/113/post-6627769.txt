Haven't you found it yet it's right over there.

No not there over there *points* next to the bright blue one. Go in that direction for about 70kly and your there. If you see the "Restaurant at the end of the galaxy" you've gone too far

I can't navigte very easily, my ship steers like a cow and every time you try and operate these weird black controls that are labeled in black on a black background, a little black light lights up in black to let you know youâ€™ve done it.
