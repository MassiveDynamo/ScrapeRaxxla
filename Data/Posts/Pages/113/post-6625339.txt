Might be easier to perform a self lobotomy. I don't have a local edd or ed-ibe database. I'm a bad citizen.

I see at EDDN under system you can run a query for system population.
Compare that to the query for Rotational period for good targets to look at?

Self lobotomy is easy as long as you're not the fussy type.

Doubt Shinrarta's lighting problem is worth all that though.
