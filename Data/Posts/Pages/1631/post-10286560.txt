Louis got me reading over the Guardian entries again. It is interesting that they share a lot of similarities to humans, as though originating from a common ancestor - aka the idea of panspermia, or the "Silurian" hypothesis on earth.


Perhaps that could also be a link with the mars artifact. Should we be combing every inch of Sol's landable moons?
It could also explain why there is a bubble of guardian influence which seems to radiate out from Sol's direction.
Indeed! I personally think (as many have also said ever since 2018) that the Codex citing 2296 as the first mention of Raxxla, and from a person in Tau Ceti (first settled human colony outside Sol) is a direct hint towards the 2280 discovery of the Martian Artefact.

I think that it's linked to "post Guardian" society - and therefore Halsey and Gan, Formidine Rift encounters in Hyperspace, and by all those connections, it's part of the Raxxla mythos.

Edit: I don't think any of this makes Raxxla Guardian by the way, I think post-Guardian sentients are perhaps trying to guide some people towards 'Raxxla'... but we don't know what it is... as Braben said
