Louis got me reading over the Guardian entries again. It is interesting that they share a lot of similarities to humans, as though originating from a common ancestor - aka the idea of panspermia, or the "Silurian" hypothesis on earth.


Perhaps that could also be a link with the mars artifact. Should we be combing every inch of Sol's landable moons?
It could also explain why there is a bubble of guardian influence which seems to radiate out from Sol's direction.
Sigh, an old theme of mine which I still hold to be probable...
That Guardians created/nurtured humanity -possibly to be a prey species as per Ram Tah's decodes, more likely in recent times refocused as a weapon against the Thargoids. The Mars Artefact hints incontrovertibly to an alien presence in Sol in ancient times, and since more likely Guardian than Thargoid. The triangular theme that appears (nowadays very briefly but it used to be much more obvious) during transitions in the ship's information panel is very similar to the glyphs on the Guardian obelisks. The fact that Pilot's Federation applies permit locks to prevent us entering systems which are clearly alien (obviously Thargoid around Col70, but probably rogue human AI/Guardian AI, etc in Bovomit and other locked regions) strongly suggests some Guardian influence is controlling things from the heart of the PF-either a descendent or a "friendly" AI. I suspect that presence to be based in Sol on moon Triton. It is possible this Guardian influence is the source of the Raxxla myth...but until we find Raxxla or uncover some new evidence breadcrumbs that FD might drip feed us we are just guessing about many things in this game...& after 8 years it's got well beyond frustrating!
