I do think there is a lot more to discover regarding the Guardian's role in this galaxy, so the discovery of more Guardian secrets may end up leading to us crossing paths with the breadcrumbs.

Perhaps even the aforementioned progenitor race could have created Raxxla, and investigating the guardians could lead to finding evidence of this ancient race.

If it is a Guardian construct, the relationship to Raxxla could be that the Guardian Construct took possession of it realising the Guardian's nature would eventually lead to them hunting entire civilizations into extinction. Or that the Construct developed Raxxla to completely obliterate all traces of the Guardians across the galaxy, but missed a few pockets of survivors or remaining artifacts.

As I thought of earlier regarding the songs https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-10286530
A simple turn of phrase could unlock a trail of breadcrumbs. Are the whisperers in witchspace the vestigial echoes of the guardians? Is there a location in real-space where we can actually hear these "haunting" songs?
