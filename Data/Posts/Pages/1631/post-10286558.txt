One obvious application where DB's saying (IF he actually ever did so!!!) that 'several commanders searching together for Raxxla might stand a better chance' would be if it were hidden in a planetary belt. That would fit with Will's EXO asteroid mining vid comment, it could also fit â€œAnd fast by, hanging in a golden chain, This pendent world, in bigness as a star Of smallest magnitude, close by the moon" ... (I hinted yesterday that if we're applying poetical standards then "golden chain" might mean something else, & I was thinking of a planetary belt).
Please note that the word is "pendent" not "pendant"! i.e. adjective meaning "hanging" not a noun "jewel", but then poetry is extremely flexible!!!
Now you're just being pedantic or is that pedentic

and perhaps we're looking for a pen shaped dent?
