Indeed! I personally think (as many have also said ever since 2018) that the Codex citing 2296 as the first mention of Raxxla, and from a person in Tau Ceti (first settled human colony outside Sol) is a direct hint towards the 2280 discovery of the Martian Artefact.

I think that it's linked to "post Guardian" society - and therefore Halsey and Gan, Formidine Rift encounters in Hyperspace, and by all those connections, it's part of the Raxxla mythos.

Edit: I don't think any of this makes Raxxla Guardian by the way, I think post-Guardian sentients are perhaps trying to guide some people towards 'Raxxla'... but we don't know what it is... as Braben said
This is definitely going to happen.... LOL

Mars relic is Guardian (well Thargoid originally and stolen as the Thargoids are God and the Guardians are Satan - the relic is the Apple from Eden)..
So the Mars relic is the key to the Raxxla worm hole to Eden, which is where the Guardian AI is having a lovely time and locked the door behind it...
Salvation has loaded his brain in to the Guardian AI network..
AI will peek it's head out as he now has a mate he didn't know about..
Thagoids will get upset and release the Thargmen to wreak havoc and we'll be forced to play on the ground and grind as there will be no place to refuel..
Lots of easy clues to Raxxla released by FD and cracked before the content was supposed to be live...
All humanity races through to the worm hole (it's Jacque's station) to save themselves while the bubble and all of the milky way burns behind them..
But you're only allowed in if you are Elite in the 20 categories now available and have grinded the relevant mats from the 4 corners of the galaxy....
One person makes it....Door is locked... GAME OVER.... shutdown the servers...
