Louis got me reading over the Guardian entries again. It is interesting that they share a lot of similarities to humans, as though originating from a common ancestor - aka the idea of panspermia, or the "Silurian" hypothesis on earth.

Biology 6/19
......their biochemistry was very similar to our own. They had blood in the same fashion as us, and it fulfilled exactly the same role as it does for us. Beyond this, they share a similar genetic structure, with DNA and RNA their core building blocks. Although a full analysis has not yet been conducted, this might be evidence of a common ancestor, but also of a branching in their genetic history. This is an astounding discovery!
Perhaps that could also be a link with the mars artifact. Should we be combing every inch of Sol's landable moons?
It could also explain why there is a bubble of guardian influence which seems to radiate out from Sol's direction.
