Here you go, I've made some notes on past ideas to re-consider These are just ones I noted down for later going-over! Spoilered because it's a long list:

Hope this maybe gives you a little more hope 07
Thank you very much for the part with Tionisla being related to Raxxla.
When the galmap allowed us to look for any bodies (stars, planet, comets too!), i got the Tionisla system.
I kept the signal sources to compare them later to identify the "NonBodyCount".

SPOILER: TIONISLA SYSTEM

NB: while i was copying it, i noticed that 2 entries are different:
JavaScript:
{ "timestamp":"2022-04-19T20:25:59Z", "event":"FSSDiscoveryScan", "Progress":1.000000, "BodyCount":30, "NonBodyCount":65, "SystemName":"Tionisla", "SystemAddress":5031789105890 }

and

{ "timestamp":"2022-04-19T20:46:18Z", "event":"NavBeaconScan", "SystemAddress":5031789105890, "NumBodies":37 }

It seems that the first only count stars and planets.
The second count the same as the first, including the belt clusters.
Comets are not counted in BodyCount.
