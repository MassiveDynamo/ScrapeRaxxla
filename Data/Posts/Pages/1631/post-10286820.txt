If this theory is right (or close to), then this has essentially covered the entire Codex (other than who might current control Raxxla). It's covered the Toast, the Omphalos, the Spiralling Stars, the Tau Ceti 2296 reference...

My current working idea is that maybe the Raxxla logo itself is some clue as to how to actually find Raxxla (or the source of the Lanscape Signal), or whatever we need to do.. but I've no ideas yet at all. Maybe it simply represents the Galaxy again?

I assume I'm definitely not the first to connect all these dots but it's pretty fun, and I've no better ideas. Corewards-ho! Back to the Landscape Expedition!

Edit: Just thought too. The Landscape signal is triangulated currently to a location between stars... a place that isn't a place, eh? XD Mr. Brookes, would you have really done that? hehe.

I do have a theory I'm working on based on the logo that might help with that line of investigation. It is very tenuous, but I don't think many people have considered it yet and at the very least it might give people something to look out for while searching. Hopefully I can structure the notes to make enough sense in a post
