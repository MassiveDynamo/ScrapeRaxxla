Tin foil hats at the ready?

Visited the last Michael Brookes memorial beacon and noted the poem at the end in particular the line "hanging in a golden chain" quick internet search and the Golden Chain is a Nigerian film about a space station that revisits the theme of the Yoruba creation tale. Quick search in game and there is a system called, yes you've guessed it "Yoruba"...

Fuller details on the film and what it's about: https://www.adebukolabodunrin.com/golden-chain

I'm going to head to Yoruba and see if there's anything out of the ordinary there or if anyone is in the area feel free to have a look on possibly a massive wild goose chase...
