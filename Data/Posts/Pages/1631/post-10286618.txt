A simple turn of phrase could unlock a trail of breadcrumbs. Are the whisperers in witchspace the vestigial echoes of the guardians? Is there a location in real-space where we can actually hear these "haunting" songs?
The whispers are the (suspected) post-Guardian beings that Halsey 'met'.

From my post: ... a long and dangerous journey to 'an area of space, not black but radiant…glowing like heaven,’ with additional audio that might sound like ‘voices that didn’t come from anything with a body’.

The brightest most radiant place I can think of is the galactic core. And we already know there's a 'song'-like signal there that everyone can hear by simply pointing towards the core, turning off your engines and drifting in the void for a bit.

The Landscape Signal has existed since pre-Horizons at least.


...by design.
