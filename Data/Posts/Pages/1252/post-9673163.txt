Marlin Duval died in 2296 (per Elite Encounters RPG). Raxxla first mentioned in 2296. Coincidence, I think not. I have some ideas that may get us somewhere but cannot play for a while, yet. Guru-951 found a permanent crashed ship at Mitterrand's Hallow with an artifact. I am thinking this is the ship that was supposed to take Ji Khanguire (Red Hourglass' son) to safety with the Duval artifact and a new identity (this is per Wanted). We may need that if Marlin Duval was killed over Raxxla.
