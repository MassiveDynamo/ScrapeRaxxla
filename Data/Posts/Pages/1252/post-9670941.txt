This is why the piracy angle got mentioned in re: Raxxla. I will work on putting together an explanation. This is 99.9% based on tourist beacons, Galnets, listening posts, and just a few bits from the First Encounters gazettes out of necessity to cover colonization properly. The "fanciful" theories aren't just hopium speaking.

We dont actually know whether Holdstockâ€™s The Dark Wheel is canon lore for Elite Dangerous. A lot of accepted lore was apparently retconned by FD a couple of years ago. Some people have produced some very fanciful hypotheses based on applying lore from previous games, books, etc to Elite Dangerous but we just dont know. The safest assumption to apply is if it isn't in the game Codex or Tourist Beacons then it doesn't apply.
