We dont actually know whether Holdstockâ€™s The Dark Wheel is canon lore for Elite Dangerous. A lot of accepted lore was apparently retconned by FD a couple of years ago. Some people have produced some very fanciful hypotheses based on applying lore from previous games, books, etc to Elite Dangerous but we just dont know. The safest assumption to apply is if it isn't in the game Codex or Tourist Beacons then it doesn't apply.
TDW is not lore, but it's accepted as a legend within the ED world. The book is not to be taken literally, but we can assume that people like Lyta Crane have read it.
