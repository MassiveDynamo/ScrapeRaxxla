You cant leave it like that!

Jorki has done his hand in killing scouts, share it here if youre willing, your names on it if it comes to anything dont worry about that.

I have to admit Im intrigued as you said theres no myth involved so would love to see what you came up with. Even if its wrong it may trigger someone else to think something. Im 90% certain theres no myth involved. Just lore and in-game myth maybe.

No pressure, but any time, Ill read it.
