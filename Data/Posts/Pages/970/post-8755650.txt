Looking at the time requirement and possible skill required, I'm not sure if I can complete the task. I'll give you what I have, see what you make of it, likely you're a better pilot than I am.
As @Jorki Rasalas said just start climbing the mountain. Or catch a ride a fleet carrier. Don't have one (yet), so can't offer a ride unfortunately.

I'm thinking of visiting lightning lagrange clouds with an Imperial Cutter, so that might be a good case for a FC.
