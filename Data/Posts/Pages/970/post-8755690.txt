KS Backers got an SD permit without any requirement for Elite....

When was DW in LFT 926 at the ground base, was it always there or did it jump out of SD? (and for some BGS reason I dont understand expanding from SD was made more difficult for the DW). Before TTW Mick and others, me included, tried to expand it from 926.

But was it there as an 'accessible' DW contact for non Elite from the start?
Not only KS backers got the SD permit. I only had beta access and I've always had it.

Not sure if that was intended or a mistake from FD. There have been a few temporary permits issued in the game. I still have them all.
