P.S. to the whisperer could mean head towards Tharg space...if we knew where it was.
I had a very long think about that but rejected it due to:
-Its a destination that is unknowable
-They aren't a siren in a void (witchspace sure is populated with bodies)
-Why give directions to the center of the galaxy by giving a star description only to have the second description be an alien race, it doesn't fit.

According to accepted spacer lore, membership in the Dark Wheel is by invitation only, and only the most exceptional pilots of each generation ever receive them. The process of initiation is subtle, and usually involves a disguised member of the Dark Wheel approaching a potential candidate and administering a test of courage and skill. If the candidate passes the test, the examiner reveals their identity and presents an invitation to join the group.

A journey that will require an engineered ship, neutron boosting and jumponium sounds more like a test of courage and skill. Execute it wrong, and your parents will grieve and your lover will woe.
