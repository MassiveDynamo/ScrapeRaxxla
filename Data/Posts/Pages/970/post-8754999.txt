It does sound plausible, and as I said earlier it would explain TDW presence in SD and the original need to be elite (SD permit) to find Raxxla. However a further thought occured- it is too stochastic. If you sell the system data for those systems elsewhere, which is most likely for most players, then they could never pass this test since you can only discover a system once. I don’t think DB/MB would allow that for the DW test as it would lock out most players from having a chance. For example when I was testing my Argonautica hypothesis I travelled the route then sold the data at the end system (Erio) on the assumption that one of the local factions was DW-affiliated (“wheels within wheels” clue from Premonition) -it wouldn’t have been logical in that context to sell the data at SD.

It is perhaps more likely that your travel history has to include a defined set of systems which then triggers a skill test which must be a passenger, cargo, or data retrieval mission (I discount assassination etc missions since TDW are explorers & adventurers).

Looking at the time requirement and possible skill required, I'm not sure if I can complete the task. I'll give you what I have, see what you make of it, likely you're a better pilot than I am.
