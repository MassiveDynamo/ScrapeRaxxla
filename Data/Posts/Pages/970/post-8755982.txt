I like it, havent seen that interpretation exactly before

Have wondered if go above or below Galaxy, if you can see a star that burns brighter than the rest, I went up once near Sag A but didnt look as not thought about at the time.

Yes, interesting interpretation. I remember on DW2 we visited a Carbon star high above the galaxy with a nice circular view of it laid out below, but can’t remember the name offhand, it’ll be in the DW2 list of waypoints.

Edit: ah yes, waypoint 8 Goliath’s Rest, planet b1 of Swoals IL-Y e0, primary neutron star, B star was huge Carbon (29xSol), had to use neutron boosts to get to it, 2,850 light years above the galactic plane, on the fringe of intergalactic space. Nice place for a picnic, but forgot the meat paste sandwiches and apple pie for desert, but still celbrated the view with a fine lavian brandy!!

@IDrankWhat: this is the shipbuild I went in https://coriolis.sourcebin.org/outf...weloBhBmUBYoFMCGBzANokICMF8hRFA&bn=Deep Peace
