Yes, interesting interpretation. I remember on DW2 we visited a Carbon star high above the galaxy with a nice circular view of it laid out below, but can’t remember the name offhand, it’ll be in the DW2 list of waypoints.

Edit: ah yes, waypoint 8 Goliath’s Rest, planet b1 of Swoals IL-Y e0, primary neutron star, B star was huge Carbon (29xSol), had to use neutron boosts to get to it, 2,850 light years above the galactic plane, on the fringe of intergalactic space. Nice place for a picnic, but forgot the meat paste sandwiches and apple pie for desert, but still celbrated the view with a fine lavian brandy!!
SPOILER

'Bad Gateway' link. I modded out a Phantom with FSD booster and AFMU, 64ly jump range and full on mats for jumponium.. I should be good.
